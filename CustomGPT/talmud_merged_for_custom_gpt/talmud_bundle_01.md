Arachin 10 – Music in the Temple

The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=10#P3996">On the days of your joy... sound the trumpets</a>!” Trumpets accompanied opening the gates, then nine sounds came with the morning daily sacrifice, and another nine with the afternoon one. Music started when wine libations began pouring. The forty-eight notes occurred when New Moon was celebrated on a Friday: nine notes were added because of additional offering, nine sounds told people to stop working in the fields, and twelve more notes were sounded if it was also Succot.
<br />
<br />
No less than two lutes accompanied singing (some say they were bagpipes, violins, or even percussion instruments), and no more than six – for sound balance. A minimal Temple orchestra to included nine harps, two instruments discussed above, and two cymbals. 
<br />
<br />
Flutes numbered no less than two and no more than twelve. Flutes were played whenever praise (Hallel) was sung. They were not made from copper but from reeds, or bamboo, because of sweeter sound. At music’s ending, only one flute played, and some say, flutes alone played, because it makes a pleasant ending.

Arachin 11 – Who Played Flutes in the Temple?

What is the logic of their disagreement?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir holds that the essential music of the Temple is vocal, and instrumental music was only for accompaniment, so anybody could play flutes, while Rabbi Chanina holds that the essence of music is instrumental, and thus flutes had to be played by the Levites, the official Temple musicians. 
<br />
<br />
However, this does not explain Rabbi Yose, who holds an in-between position. We have to take it back: everybody believes that the essence of Temple music is singing, and their argument is about something else: does the court assume that once someone was seen playing music in the Temple, he is automatically considered to be Levy and fit to receive the tithe. Rabbi Meir says that the court makes no such assumption, therefore even slaves can play – nobody will make them Levites because of that, and Rabbi Chanina says that music playing is evidence that he is a Levite.

Arachin 12 – Bad Things Happen on a Bad Day

Since libations include wine, and the Levites started singing when wine was poured on the Altar, maybe it is required; on the other hand, since there is no meat with libations, maybe it is not required?
<br />
<br />
Let us try to find an answer in the story of the Temples' Destruction, as related by Rabbi Yose: “Good things are brought about on an auspicious day, and bad things – on a bad day. It was the first day of the week and the first year after Shmita, and the Levites were singing 'God turned their violence against them', and just as they concluded with 'God our Lord will cut them off' the enemies came and vanquished them; and so it was at the destruction of the Second Temple.”
<br />
<br />
Now, why were they singing? The daily sacrifice stopped a while back, so it must have been the libations, which proves that libations require singing. – Not necessarily, maybe they chanced upon a calf. Furthermore, as Rava said, it would be the wrong song for Sunday anyway, and it just happened that they started singing a dirge, for Resh Lakish said that Temple song can be performed without a sacrifice. But if so, let them sing for libations! – No, if we allow singing for a sacrifice that does not require singing, they may eventually skip singing when it is requried.

According to the final account, the Second Temple was destroyed in the first year after&nbsp;Shmita. This gives a starting point for&nbsp;counting the&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;years today; however, there are still&nbsp;two views on how to count the first year of creation – from the creation of Adam, or from the first day of creation, counting the first six days as a full year. The second view is the accepted one, with the result that the next&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;is in&nbsp;2014-15.
<br />
<br />
There were no fewer than six inspected lambs, sufficient for Shabbat and the two days of Rosh HaShanah, but they could add without a limit. But was six lambs enough for three days, seeing that there are additional offerings on these day!? – Six is not precise, just a reminder to keep enough.<br />
<br />
There were no less than two trumpets, but up to 120, no less than nine harps, and only one set of cymbals. 
<br />
<br />
Young Levites boys did not play musical instruments, nor stood on the platform, but only sang standing on the floor of the Temple, and they were called assistants of the Levites, but some say, tormentors, because adult ones could never sing as sweet.

Arachin 14 – Leniencies and Stringencies

Thus, whether one vowed to donate the symbolic value of the handsomest man in Israel or of the ugliest man in Israel, he gives fifty selah coins for a male between twenty and sixty years old. 
<br />
<br />
Consecration of ancestral fields may likewise result in a leniency or in a stringency: whether he consecrates land on the perimeter of a city (the worst), or in the vineyards of Sebaste (the best), when he redeems it, he gives&nbsp;fifty silver shekels&nbsp;for an area on which a measure of barley can be sown .<br />
<br />
This requires explanation. Ancestral fields are fields inherited from the original division of the Land of Israel between the tribes, or fields sold by the Temple treasury. What measure of barley? - Chomer (same as kor, about 10 cubic feet), and this much barley was enough to sow the area of about five acres. This is the area one would redeem for 50 silver shekels. If the land market value was higher, he got a leniency, if lower – a stringency.

Arachin 15 – How Bad is Bad Talk?

Whether one seduced or violated the daughter of the most prominent family of Kohanim or the lowest family of Israel, he pays fifty shekels. By contrast, the &nbsp;payments for humiliation depends on who humiliated and who was humiliated.
<br />
<br />
One who <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=22#P5478">defames his new wife</a> may face a leniency and a stringency: whether he defamed the most prominent maiden in the priesthood or the humblest maiden among the Jewish people, he pays a hundred shekels.
<br />
<br />
We thus see that one who speaks evil with his mouth is worse than one who performs an evil deed. Similary, the decree that the Jews should not enter Israel and stay in the desert for another forty years was sealed on account of the bad words they said about the Land of Israel. The Torah said, “They tested Me these (literally, this) ten times”, and the word “this” tells that these bad words were the reason. If one is punished so for talking about land and rocks, then now much more when talking about his fellow.<br />

If he is a scholar, he should learn Torah and books on self-improvement, and if he can't learn, he should become humble. Rav Acha said, “There is no correction for bad things that were already said. This advice is for one who wants to protect himself from speaking badly.”
<br />
<br />
Bad speech kills three: the speaker, the listener, and the one they talk about. The garment of the High Priest had bells, and they atoned for bad talk – but only if it had not lead to quarrels.
<br />
<br />
One should reprove his friend for bad deeds, but only if the friend is righteous and will listen; however, Rabbi Tarfon said that in his generation nobody accepted rebuke, and in the next one nobody could rebuke properly. Assuming that the generations go down, this is all the more true today.
<br />
<br />
Suffering is helpful spiritually, what is the minimal amount? When newly made clothing does not fit, but some say when one puts a shirt inside out, and some – when one wants to take out three coins and takes out only two. However, if he took out three coins and needs to put one back – it is not suffering.

Arachin 17 – When One Pays What He Can

If he is poor, he only pays what he can afford, as estimated by a Kohen. 
<br />
<br />
What happens, however, when he promises the value of someone else? In this case, the “what he can pay” dispensation applies to him, not to the one whose value he promised. Thus, if a poor man vowed the value of a rich man, he gives the value of a poor man. By contrast, with the sacrifices it is different: if a poor man vowed to buy the sacrifices for a spiritual leper, “metzora,” and this leper is rich, the poor man has to pay for the sacrifices of a rich one. Why is this difference? The symbolic value obligation did not exist until he promised it, therefore, it is his obligation, and it depends on his wealth. By contrast, the obligations of the leper already existed: due to the leper's actions he got this spiritual condition, and it is his ability to pay that determines if he gets a discount.<br />

Arachin 18 – Age for Symbolic Value

<br />
<br />
The thirtieth day of an infant is considered as days before, and this infant has no symbolic value yet. Similarly, the fifth year is considered as years before, and so the twentieth, which results in lower symbolic values. Why? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3574">From sixty years of age and higher</a>” to teach that only subsequent years are included. But how can we derive anything from the sixtieth year, when the symbolic value decreases, resulting in a stringency, and apply the rule to the twentieth year, when the value increases, resulting in a leniency? – We learn it from an extra word “years” in the phrase “from five years to twenty years” where “from five years to twenty” would have been enough.
<br />
<br />
At sixty the symbolic value of a man drops by 70%, but that of a woman drops significantly less. Why?  Chizkiyah quoted a proverb, “An old man in a house is a calamity, but an old woman in a house is a treasure.”

There was an incident when the mother of Yirmatya promised to pay the weight of her daughter, but did not specify the material. Since she was fabulously rich, they estimated that she had to pay in gold. The weight is taken at the time and hour of the vow.
<br />
<br />
If one promised the weight of his arm to the Temple, they measure the water displaced by his arm, and add donkey's flesh, bones, and sinews, until the water riches the same level. Rabbi Yose says that even though donkey meat is a good approximation, it will never be precise, therefore, they just estimate.
<br />
<br />
If he promised the worth (not weight) of his arm to the Temple, they estimate how much he is worth when working with one hand tied up; in this vows are more stringent than a symbolic value of hand - which is zero, since it is not a vital organ.

Furthermore, one can promise either a monetary value - the price that this person could fetch in a slave market - or a symbolic value, expressed in shekel coins, in the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27">amount prescribed by the Torah</a>.
<br />
<br />
All persons can both declare such a vow and be the subject of it, a man or a woman, Kohen, Levi, or a regular Jew.  An androgyne or a person of undetermined gender can do all of the above, except for a symbolic value. Since Torah-assigned values are provided only for definite males or females, these two do not have specific symbolic values that can be donated for them. Thus, if one makes a “personal valuation” vow related to them, it is always treated as a monetary value they would fetch in a slave market.
<br />
<br />
A deaf, deranged, or a minor can have their value donated by others, but they themselves cannot make such vows. Since they lack sufficient understanding, they are considered legally incompetent.

Arachin 20 – Real vs Symbolic Value

For example, if he vowed his symbolic value to the Temple but died before paying, his heirs must give it: since the symbolic obligation is fixed by the Torah, it exists from the moment he vows. By contrast, if he promised his real value (as defined by being sold on the slave market), and died before he was appraised, his heirs need not give anything, since dead have no monetary value.
<br />
<br />
If one vows to give “half of his symbolic value,” he gives half, but if he vows to give “symbolic value of half of him” - then he pays the full amount, because half of him cannot live without the other half. In this respect, real value vows are the same: if he vows value of half of him, it is tantamount to the whole value.
<br />
<br />
If one promised his ox as a sacrifice or his house as donation to the Temple, and the ox died or the house fell, he does not have to pay. However, if he promises their value, he will have to pay if they are not extant.

Arachin 21 – Forcing to Fulfill the Temple Obligation

If he procrastinates, the Temple treasurers may get the permission of the court to exact some of his possessions as security. If he does not pay within thirty days, they become the property of the Temple.
<br />
<br />
This is also true if he promises a voluntary offering. Since it brings optional atonement, for example, for wrong thoughts or for skipping saying “Shema Israel,” one does not feel pressured to fulfill his vow and needs an additional incentive. However, for sin and guilt offerings – which are brought, for example, for unwitting Shabbat violations, or for&nbsp;liaison&nbsp;with a maidservant designated for another –&nbsp;treasurers&nbsp;do not exact security: one who feels the need to atone for this will eventually do it on his own.
<br />
<br />
Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=1#P2746">He must bring it, of his will</a>,” fulfilling his vow to bring a sacrifice is a commandment, but it must be done willingly. Therefore, if need be, they force him, until he declares “I want to do it.”

If he leaves young orphans, the court first appraises the field, then conducts an auction, allowing people to bid on it for thirty days. For a field consecrated to the Temple, the auction lasts for sixty days. During these days there is a public auction announcement in the morning and in the evening.
<br />
<br />
The auction is an attempt to get higher price for the orphans. Shouldn't it also last for sixty days? – No, this may be counterproductive, since people may retract their bids. Then shouldn't the Temple auction run for thirty days? – No, because an oral bid to the Temple is considered binding, and there the people can't retract.
<br />
<br />
Why is the announcement done in the morning and in the evening? So that the businessmen could ask their workers to inspect the property on the way home and to remind them to inquire of the results in the morning.
<br />
<br />
But, as a rule, one cannot collect from orphans while they are minors and has to wait until they grow up. Why didn't the teacher talk about a regular case of heirs? Because he wanted to discuss the exceptonal cases when the court does sell their lands while they are still minors – when there are interest payments on the loan, and they are diminishing the estate.

If one consecrated all of his possessions to the Temple, the Ketubah part is not consecrated, because it came prior. However, if the husband now wants to divorce his wife, we make him vow never to re-marry her, because we suspect that the divorce is just a ruse: she will collect the Ketubah, and he will re-marry her and live on that money – this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says that he does not need to vow – either because people do not cheat on Temple, or because he can annul his consecration.
<br />
<br />
Rav Huna was poor, and his father, Moshe bar Atzri, promised to pay the Ketubah of his wife. Abbaye said, “Who would advise Rav Huna to divorce his wife and collect the money?” Rav Huna was a Kohen, who cannot re-marry his wife, and Abbaye remarked, “Poverty follows after the poor.”
<br />
<br />
But maybe Moshe ben Atzri just wanted to help his son and was not sincere in his promise? – He accepted to be a guarantor even if his son does have the money, and such a guarantee is always binding.

For example, if someone consecrated his possessions to the Temple, but part of them were needed to pay the Ketubah of his wife or his debt obligation – the one who redeems the complete amount refunds a part as a Ketubah or debt payment. The payments do not go directly from the Temple to individuals, so that people would not think that sacred property can be converted to private property without redemption.
<br />
<br />
Although the Temple treasurers may <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/arachin-21-forcing-to-fulfill-temple.html">force individuals to fulfill their Temple vows and even enter his house and seize his property</a>, they leave him food for thirty days, clothing for twelve months, a bed and tools of trade – and sustenance is for him, but not for his family.
<br />
<br />
One can consecrate his ancestral field to the Temple, and then redeem it at a fixed price prescribed by the Torah. The <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/arachin-14-leniencies-and-stringencies.html">price of fifty silver shekels that we mentioned earlier</a> is the maximum price for the 49 nine years until the Jubilee year. Since the field returns to him in the Jubilee year anyway, every year&nbsp;the price is reduced. However, because of a technicality, it is not reduced within the last two years before the Jubilee, and one should therefore be mindful of that when consecrating his field.<br />

If one consecrated his field during this time and wished to redeem it, he paid fifty silver shekels&nbsp;for an area on which a measure of barley can be sown . What measure? - Chomer (same as kor, about 10 cubic feet), and this much barley was enough to sow the area of about five acres. The full fifty-shekel price applied only for the full forty-nine years of the Jubilee cycle, but in the middle of the cycle the price was adjusted for the years remaining. Thus it came out that for each year until Jubilee he paid a selah (Biblical shekel) and a pundyon – a small coin, the value of one forty-eighths of a selah. He could not pay this in installments.
<br />
<br />
If the owner redeemed his field, he had to add one-fifth, while others did not have to add one-fifth. On the other hand, the owner kept the field at the Jubilee years, while others who redeemed the field had to give it up in Jubilee, and it was divided among the kohanim. (In another version of the text it goes back to the owner.)

Arachin 26 – A Field That Was Not Redeemed

One is described by Rabbi Yehudah: the Kohanim take possession of the field, but they must pay the full redemption price of fifty silver shekels per measure of barley to the treasury. Why? Because a consecrated field is similar to a consecrated house (the Torah uses the same word, “holy”), and the house is never redeemed without a payment.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that the Kohanim take the possession of the field without a payment, because it is similar to the two lambs of Shavuot, about which the Torah also said “holy,” and which belong to the Kohanim without a payment. And Rabbi Yehudah? – Better to compare consecrated field to a house – both are real estate. And Rabbi Shimon? – Better to compare field to a sacrifice – both  are presents to Kohanim.
<br />
<br />
According to Rabbi Elazar, nobody takes possession of the field, it is called “abandoned,” and  remains in the Temple treasury until the next Jubilee. Why? – Normally, when one sells a field, it comes back to him (“<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=25#P3495">goes out of the hands of the buyer</a>”) at Jubilee; but why should it “go out of the hands of the Temple?"<br />

Arachin 27 – An Acquired Field

Since this is an "acquired," not ancestral field, it is redeemed for its market value, not the fifty shekels per measure of barley, and in the Jubilee year it goes back to the ancestral owner, rather than being divided by the Kohanim.
<br />
<br />
If one bought a field from his father, then his father died, and then he consecrated it, it is treated as an ancestral field, since it could come to him as his inheritance. However, if he consecrated the field first, and afterwards his father died, then it is treated as an acquired field, which is redeemed for its market value.
<br />
<br />
When the Jubilee year is not in force, the laws are different. All fields are redeemed for their market value. The auction is started by the treasurer telling the owner, who had consecrated the field, “You bid first” since the owner is required to add one-fifth to his redemption price. It once happened that one consecrated an inferior field. He was required to bid first, however, so he offered a small coin. The treasurer told him "The field is yours." The field reverted back to him, and all he accomplished was to loose a small coin.

Arachin 28 – Promise to the Temple is Like Deed with People

If afterwards the one who has bid forty retracted, they pay ten shekels each. However, if they retracted simultaneously, the one who has bid fifty is responsible for his ten, and for half of the other one's ten, so he pays fifteen, while the other one pays five.
<br />
<br />
One can “dedicate” his property by making it forbidden ("cherem") to himself, and then assign it either to the Temple or to the Kohanim. All donations that we learned about so far were promises, this one is actual giving over, only it works in two steps: it becomes forbidden to him immediately, and it either remains forbidden in the possession of the Temple until redemption, or it becomes permitted to the Kohanim once they take possession of it.
<br />
<br />
One can dedicate ("cherem") some of his sheep, cattle, of fields, but not all of them. In general, one should have pity on his possessions and not give away everything – as a guideline, no more than one-fifth.

Arachin 29 – Dedication (“cherem”) - To Whom?

Among the Kohanim, it goes to the family&nbsp;that&nbsp;serves in the Temple this week.
<br />
<br />
If one pronounced a dedication but did not specify who it should go to, then it goes to the upkeep of the Temple – so says Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira, since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3596">Any dedication (“cherem”) is most holy to God</a>.” &nbsp;However, the Sages says that any unspecified dedication goes to the Kohanim, since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3579">Any dedicated field shall be to the Kohen</a>.” If so, how do the Sages explain the phrase used by Rabbi Yehoshua? – It teaches that one can dedicate ("cherem") even offerings that are already holy , which will result in additional obligations on his part.
<br />
<br />
If one sells an ancestral field, he is not permitted to redeem it less than two years after the sale, as the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=25#P3482">According to the number of crops is the price</a>”, and the minimal number of plural “crops” is two. However, a year of drought or a shemittah year &nbsp;don't go into the count.

Arachin 3 - What Does the Word "All" Add?

Talmud goes on a whirlwind tour of about fifty cases of using the word “all,” discussing what it adds. Firstly, valuations: ALL can declare a valuation vow - adds minors a year before bat or bar mitzvah, who clearly understand vows. ALL can be the subject of a valuation vow - including an ugly person or one with skin boils, whose value on the slave market is zero.
<br />
<br />
ALL lean on a sacrifice declaring the reason for bringing it - ALL adds the son who inherits the sacrifice from his father.
<br />
<br />
One may force ALL the members of his household to move to Israel. This ruling reflects the opinion that living in Israel is a commandment, based on the Torah phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=33#P4811">Clear out the land and live in it.</a>” ALL adds one who would have to give up a beautiful dwelling outside Israel and move to inferior quarters in Israel. Other cases of using the word "all" include sukkah, lulav, tzitzit, tefillin, Temple visits, shofar, megillah, impurity discharge, spiritual leprosy, and kosher slaughter of animals.

Arachin 30 – Redemption of Ancestral Fields

<br />
On the other hand, if the owner sold the field to the first buyer for two hundred coins, and the first buyer then resold the field to a second buyer for a hundred coins, the owner redeems it based on the price of the second buyer, that is, one hundred coins, since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=25#P3494">He shall calculate and return the remainder to the man</a>...” – which man? – the one who currently owns the field.
<br />
<br />
How can the same phrase be interpreted in two different ways, both times to the advantage of the owner? Abaye said, “I am today as sharp as Ben Azzai, who was smarter than all the Sages, and I will explain: fields are compared to a Hebrew slave, and Hebrew slave was given multiple leniencies by God.”

It thus looks like prohibited interest: the seller got the money, the buyer lived in the house (interest), and then the seller returned the money (as if returned the loan). However, it is not really prohibited interest, since interest is a loan payment fixed in advance, and here he sold his house, and only later it turned out that he could buy it back. 
<br />
<br />
What does the Torah mean by saying that the redemption period is a “full” year? – If this year happens to have thirteen months, he is given an extra month. (To adjust for difference between lunar months and solar year, an extra month is added every few years). Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that “full” year means a solar year of 365 days. It can thus happen, according to the Sages, that a house sold, for example, on the fifteens of the first month of Adar I, will have more redemption time than another house, sold later, on the first of Adar II.

Hillel enacted a law by which the original owner could deposit redemption money in a special room – and some say, with the court – and then break down the door of the house and enter.
<br />
<br />
All constructions similar to a house within a walled city can be likewise sold and redeemed within a year, but not fields – this is the opinion of the Sages. Rabbi Meir, based on the words of the Torah “which is in the city” includes even the fields for a one-year redemption. But it does say “house'! – You are right, and in fact Rabbi Meir includes only pebble fields, which are similar to a house, but not all fields.
<br />
<br />
Jerusalem belonged to all tribes, and therefore the law of walled cities did not apply to it, and houses there could always be redeemed. Other walled cities were re-sanctified by Ezra, and they kept this sanctity, because Jews never stopped living in Israel after Ezra.

Houses in open towns are in between these two categories, and the Torah gives them the enhanced rights of walled citied and the enhanced rights of ancestral fields. How so? They can be redeemed immediately after sale and for the entire twelve months, like houses in walled cities; and they return to their owners in the Jubilee year, besides, their redemption price goes down with the years passed toward the Jubilee year.
<br />
<br />
Obviously, a town needs a wall. However, even if it has a wall but is very small, consisting of two courtyards of two houses each, then even if it had a wall from the time of Joshua the son of Nun, they are treated like houses in open towns.

Instead, each tribe provided cities for them to settle. Should a Levite sell his house, he can redeem it any time in the future – unlike the Israelites who have but a year. However, these rules are obvious from the Torah, and the Talmud begins from the first non-obvious case.
<br />
<br />
If a regular Jew (Yisrael) inherited a house in the city of the Levites from his maternal grandfather, he redeems it like a regular Jew, only for a year – this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who attaches importance to who the seller is. However, the Sages say that he does not have to be a Levi, but rather, all houses in the city of Levites follow the same rules.
<br />
<br />
Around the cities Torah mandates an open space for a thousand steps for beauty, and another thousand for farming, and these may not be exchanged.
<br />
<br />
Kohanim and Levites may sell their houses in walled cities and redeem them at any time, their houses never become permanent property of the buyer, who may always be forced by the Levi to sell them back.

<br />
<br />
ALL are obligated to hear the Megillah - adds those who are occupied with the Temple service; even they should leave the service and listen to the Megillah.
<br />
<br />
ALL can declare a symbolic personal value donation, according to one’s age and gender, as <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27">prescribed by the Torah</a>, Kohanim, Levites, and Israelim. But that is obvious! If not these, then who? Rabbah says that this is a hidden answer to Ben Buchri, who explained that Kohanim never pay a shekel-donation (even though the Sages disagree). One might therefore think the same about personal valuation, and this had to be negated. Abaye argues that there is no connection, rather, it is an answer to  a possible idea that since the Kohanim do not redeem their firstborn, perhaps they can’t do symbolic valuations either. Rava denies that connection also and says that ALL excludes the possibility that perhaps one Kohen cannot assign the discounted valuation that another, poor Kohen, has to give - and the answer is that he can!

Arachin 5 - Personal Valuation of an Infant and of an Idolater

When the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27">Torah assigned symbolic values of people to be donated to the Temple</a>, it started from one month old. What happens when one promises to donate the symbolic value of a child before one month? Rabbi Meir says that people never make vain statements in serious matters, therefore, since he knows that there is no value assigned to the baby, he means to donate its value in the slave market. The Sages say that people do make vain statements, and thus this person is treated as one who said nothing.
<br />
<br />
An idolater can make regular monetary vows and be a subject of the vows of others. Although idolater’s symbolic value for the Temple was not listed, Rabbi Meir says that he is nevertheless included, while Rabbi Yehudah says that he can donate other people’s symbolic value but not his own. The Torah uses both an inclusive “a man” and exclusive “Children of Israel,” but Rabbi Meir says that it is more common to be a recipient of a symbolic valuation vow, while Rabbi Yehudah argues that it is more common to be a giver.

Arachin 6 - Money for Charity
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOLchyphenhyphenVxlU8iaGXL1X968aSWvYh4g__brDPrnbeIK5wzqvGgS38ZtTLplJyc2fAfcpyvpeAaiRyIZldzJ1Msm_iLaWJ56TW8TkwIob6V_1HtQnMZRmZTmvn9dIeIDDq1qqDO9lFmRBBc4/s1600/Camille+Pissarro+-+Charity.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOLchyphenhyphenVxlU8iaGXL1X968aSWvYh4g__brDPrnbeIK5wzqvGgS38ZtTLplJyc2fAfcpyvpeAaiRyIZldzJ1Msm_iLaWJ56TW8TkwIob6V_1HtQnMZRmZTmvn9dIeIDDq1qqDO9lFmRBBc4/s320/Camille+Pissarro+-+Charity.jpg" width="262" /></a>If an idolater separated a Kohen’s portion (terumah) from his grain, saying “I wanted to do what Jews do” - this is a valid. However, if he said nothing, then perhaps he meant for the Temple, and since there is no Temple, it has to be hidden. In general, any “consecration for the Temple” today creates a similar problem.
<br />
<br />
Money designated for charity is similar to a vow: just as a vow has to be fulfilled in its due time, so charity has to be paid; if the time was not specified, it means right away. However, it is not similar to Temple consecration: one can use designated coins, and then repay. One who collects charity - money or objects -from people should be careful to use it according to their designation, unless he knows that they would not mind if he uses it for a different good cause.
<br />
<br />
One who is in the throes of death and one who is going out to be executed by court cannot be a subject of any monetary vow. But the condemned should at least have a symbolic value!? - Since there is not redemption for a murderer, by analogy there is none for the condemned one.
<br />

But <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/arachin-5-personal-valuation-of-infant.html">who does he disagree with</a>? &nbsp;Rabbi Yose concealed his message; he meant: if one led to execution harms someone, the Sages declare him liable, while Rabbi Yose says that he does not have to pay. They argue whether his heirs have to pay for him. Alternatively, since the obligations of a damager are written in the Torah, they argue whether this has the power of a court decision.
<br />
<br />
One condemned by the court is executed immediately, to spare the anguish of waiting. If a pregnant woman is condemned, they don't wait until she gives birth; however, if the baby moved as a beginning of birth, it became a separate person, and then they wait until she gives birth. A dead body is prohibited for benefit, but they may use a woman's hair.
<br />
<br />
But the hair also should be forbidden! - She said, “Give my hair to my daughter.” Why would we listen? - It's a wig tied to her hair. With her words, she revealed that she does not consider it part of her body, and this permits to remove the hair later.

However, it is never less than a selah (shekel), since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3593">And every valuation shall be in a sacred shekel</a>.” Incidentally, it cannot exceed 50 shekels, the upper limit given by the Torah.
<br />
<br />
If one was poor, paid his selah, and then became rich, he does not have to pay the remainder, since he already fulfilled his obligation. However, if while being poor he paid less than a selah, it does not count, and now that he became rich, he has to pay the full amount.
<br />
<br />
On the subject of minimum and maximum, a woman who confused her menstrual cycle according to the Torah law, never has to compensate less than seven days and never more than seventeen. Due to the complexity of these laws, a custom arose to observe standard, although pretty long, separation time periods.

The lunar month is about 29 ½ days, so some months have to be short, and some long. In the time of this ruling, beginning of a new month was declared based on the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. The Sages would also move the first day of the month slightly, for calendar purposes, but kept it within the above guidelines, so that Rosh Hashanah would never be too far off from New Moon.

The two loaves of Shavuot are not baked on the holiday itself, so they were eaten at least two days after they were baked, but no more than three days – when Shabbat intervened.

The bread of vision was baked before Shabbat, stayed on the Table in the Temple for the week, and was then eaten the following Shabbat – while still fresh and warm. Thus, they were eaten no less than nine days after baking, but no more than eleven – when two days of Rosh HaShana intervened.

Instead of answering, R. Yehudah would  bring Antoninus into his garden daily, and would pluck a single radish from a bed in front of him. Antoninus said to himself, "R. Yehudah is advising me to kill them off one at a time."<br />
<br />
But let him say it directly! - Maybe the dignitaries will overhear. But say it quietly! - "<a href="http://bible.cc/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">A bird of the sky will carry the sound</a>"&nbsp;- one can never be sure that a private conversation will remain secret.<br />
<br />
A secret cave led from the palace of Antoninus to the house of Rabbi Yehudah. Daily, Antoninus would visit Rabbi Yehudah and study Torah with him, but he wanted this to be secret. He would bring two servants with him, killing one at the entrance to the house of Rabbi Yehudah, and another on return. Antoninus told Rabbi Yehudah that nobody should be present at their meeting, but one day, Rabbi Chanina bar Chama was there. <br />
<br />
Antoninus was upset, but Rabbi Yehudah told Antoninus, "It is not a man, but an angel." To verify this, Antoninus told Rabbi Chanina, "Go and wake my servant, sleeping at the door." Rabbi Chanina found the servant dead. Not wanting to either come back with bad news or flee, Rabbi Chanina revived the servant. Antoninus said, "I know that the least among you can resurrect the dead, but please, next time, nobody should be with you."<br />

There was also another festival in Rome. Once in seventy years, they would take a healthy person, representing Esau, and have him ride upon the shoulders of a lame person, representing Jacob. They would dress the upper man in the attire of Adam, the first man, which he had used for hunting, and they would put the scalp of Rabbi Ishmael on his head. They would declare, "The calculations of the ruler (Jacob) are wrong" (which meant that the Jews still had not been redeemed). The brother (Jacob) of our lord (Esau) is a cheat; woe to one of them when the other one arises."<br />

A thorn should not be removed from one's foot in front of an idol, nor should one collect his money scattered in front of an idol. Instead, one should first turn to the side so as not to give the appearance of bowing down to that idol. <br />
<br />
Both rulings are necessary. The thorn can be removed elsewhere, but one might have thought that money is allowed to be collected. Conversely, one can lose some money, but one might think that removing a thorn, which is painful, would be allowed. The ruling informs us that both actions are prohibited.<br />

<br />
Resh Lakish stated that this prohibition applies only to shops decorated with roses or myrtle, as they have been dedicated to the idol, and the buyer derives benefit from the fragrance upon entering the shop. The Torah only prohibited deriving benefit from idolatrous matter, saying, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/13-17.htm">No part of the banned property may adhere to your hand.</a>"<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yochanan prohibits all shops, even those decorated with fruit. By patronizing the shop, one provides a benefit to the idol, either because the priests own the shop or the store owner pays taxes to them. If deriving benefit from an idol is prohibited, then providing it with benefit is certainly prohibited<br />

Since idol worship is included in the seven Noahide laws, a Jew selling these items, which were used for idol worship back then, would be "putting a stumbling block in front of a blind man."<br />
<br />
However, selling a large bundle of these items is allowed. It can be assumed that the buyer is a merchant who will be reselling them at a profit, and the “stumbling block” prohibition does not go that far.<br />
<br />
If an idol worshipper asks for other items, specifying that they are for idol worship, it is prohibited to sell them to him. One cannot rationalize that this man is simply so devoted to idol worship that he expects all others to be as devoted and sell to him at a discount. <br />
<br />
The tractate Avodah Zarah of our father Abraham was comprised of 400 chapters. We have only five, and we encounter difficulties even with these, since we are not certain which cedar trees are meant above.<br />

The reason for this rule is that, in the first place, idolaters are careful to guard against bestiality, but in the second, they are accustomed to permit it.<br />
<br />
But contrast this with the following ruling: "One should not stable an animal at the inns of idol worshippers, because they are suspected of bestiality" - this ruling gives a blanket prohibition! The difference is that the idolater is concerned that his animal would not become sterile, and will not sodomize it if it is his own.<br />
<br />
One is never allowed to sell large livestock. Why? The sale may happen right before Sabbath, and the idolater will ask the Jew to call the animal to see how it walks; the animal will move and carry its load. The Jew will thus cause his animal to work on the Sabbath. Therefore, to sell through an intermediary is allowed, since the animal does not know the reseller and will not follow their command.<br />

One should not build with the idol worshippers a basilica - a tall palatial structure used as a hall of justice - from whose top the guilty and condemned were hurled to their deaths. Alternatively, this is prohibited because it served as a pedestal for an idol. However, one may build together with them beautiful buildings used for neither idolatry nor judicial proceedings, and one may also build bathhouses. Nevertheless, once in the construction of the latter, they reach the dome on which an idol was usually placed, it is forbidden to continue building together with the idol worshipers.<br />

Ulla was confident that since he was pure of character, he would not entertain improper thoughts, but did it out of respect. He advised others to refrain from such activities. Some say it is an allegory of Ulla's love of Torah.<br />
<br />
Elazar ben Durdia did not leave one harlot in the world without a visit. Once he heard that there was a particular harlot overseas who took a purse of coins for her services. He crossed seven rivers for her sake. When they were starting, she blew wind with her mouth and said, "Just as this air cannot return, so they will not receive Elazar ben Durdia in repentance." He went and sat between two mountains and asked the mountains, heaven, earth, moon, and stars to beseech mercy for him. They all said that they needed mercy for themselves. He then saw that the matter depended solely on him, and cried until his soul departed. A heavenly voice proclaimed, "Rabbi Elazar ben Durdia is ready for life in the World to Come!"<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince cried and said, "Some get their World to Come in a single moment, and they are even called Rabbi". <br />

They wrapped him in a Torah scroll and placed tufts of wet wool over his heart to prolong his suffering. The students asked him, "Master, what do you see?" He answered, "I see letters flying away in the air." They said, "Master, hasten your death!" He answered, "It is better that He who gave the soul should take it." At this, the executioner said, "Master, if I increase the flame and save you from suffering, will you take me to the World to Come?" Rabbi Chanina said, "Yes." Executioner did so, then threw himself into the fire. The Heavenly voice proclaimed, "Both are ready for the World to Come."<br />
<br />
The daughter of Rabbi Chanina was the sister-in-law of Rabbi Meir. She was put into a brothel, and he went to save her. He pretended to be a customer, but she avoided him. Now he was sure that she never sinned, and bribed the guard. In case of danger, he told the guard to say, "God of Meir, save me!" The guard was apprehended, but saved himself with this phrase. They then announced a search for Rabbi Meir, and because of that, he had to flee to Babylon, but some say that it happened because of the story with his wife Beruria.<br />

Two students of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince wanted to study different subjects, Levi – Proverbs, and Rabbi Shimon – Psalms. They prevailed over Levi to study Psalms, but once they learned, "but his desire is in the Torah of God," - Levi said, "You taught me the permission to go back to Proverbs."<br />
<br />
"<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/1-3.htm">And he shall be like a tree rooted by a stream of waters</a>,"  teaches that one should not learn from a single teacher, but uproot himself and go to another. Rav Chisda taught this to his students, and they all left him and went to Rabbah. Rabbah told them, "This dictum only applies to learning logic, but the body of knowledge is better acquired from one teacher, in one style" - and they all came back to Rav Chisda.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Alexandri would  call out, "Who wants life?" People gathered, and he quoted, "<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/34-13.htm">Guard your tongue from evil</a>". Now, a man may think, "I will be silent and go to sleep." To discourage such thinking, it continues, "<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/34-14.htm">and do good</a>"&nbsp;- study the Torah.<br />

<br />
Three days prior to his festival, the idolater is already focused on his deity, because at this time he begins to search for an animal that is suitable to use as a sacrifice. He, therefore, is likely to pay homage to his deity on the day of the festival for any benefits that have accrued to him from that point onward.  A Jew, therefore, may not do business with an idolater during those three days, since he will indirectly cause the idolater to praise the name of his alien god.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah says, "We accept payment from them, since this causes the payer distress," but the Sages reply, "Though it causes him distress now, he rejoices afterward."<br />

We do not sell plants attached to the ground to idol worshippers, as part of the general prohibition not to sell them land in Israel; however, one may sell the plants once they have been cut down.

<br />
Selling houses to idol worshippers in Israel is prohibited by the Torah phrase, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">do not give them a holding in the land</a>." Renting was prohibited by the Sages as a precautionary measure because renting may lead to selling.<br />
<br />
In the case of fields, there is an additional problem, because selling the fields to an idolater removes the obligation to give the priest's portions and the tithes. <br />
<br />
Those are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yose says that we may rent them houses but not fields.<br />
<br />
Even in a place where the Sages allowed renting houses to idol worshippers, this is not said concerning renting a house for use as living quarters, because the old worshipper will inevitably bring idols into the house, thereby placing the Jewish lessor in violation of "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">You shall not bring an abomination in your house</a>." The latter ruling is not applicable nowadays.<br />

However, in the ancient times among pagan nations bestiality was widespread, and therefore...<br />
<br />
We may not stable an animal in the inns of idol worshippers, since they are suspect in regard to bestiality. Anyone who leaves an animal at their disposal would violate "do not put a stumbling block in front of a blind man." <br />
<br />
However, following this logic, we should allow placing female animals with female idolaters? No! This was prohibited, because idol worshippers commonly consort with their fellows' wives, and sometimes an idol worshipper visiting his paramour will not find her at home, but may find a Jew's animal there, and sodomize it, since they preferred Israelite's animals to their own wives. This made sense, since his own animal might become sterile, and with someone's wife, he might be discovered; thus, the Jewish animal was the most defenseless creature. <br />

Therefore, this animal, and any other animal bought from idol worshippers, may be brought as a sacrifice in the Temple. We also do not suspect that it has been worshipped, since in that case the idol worshipper would not have sold it. This is the opinion of the Sages. According to them, not leaving animals in the stables of idol worshippers is a requirement and good advice.<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Eliezer disagrees. According to him, it is always suspected that an animal of idol worshippers has been sodomized. Thus, if one did leave the animal in the stables of idol worshippers, he can no longer bring it as a sacrifice.<br />

How, according to him, can one ever make ashes of a red heifer? Consider the following story.<br />
<br />
Dama ben Netinah was a non-Jew who exemplified respect for parents. The Sages wanted to buy from him a gem for the Kohen's breastplate for 600,000 golden coins. He refused, because the key from the jewelry box was under the pillow on which his father was sleeping. Next year, however, a red heifer was born among his cattle. He said to the Sages, “I know that you will pay me any money for it, but I only want the 600,000 that I lost.”<br />
<br />
How did they buy a cow from him? Rabbi Eliezer will answer that they watched it from the moment it was conceived. But maybe its mother was sodomized? - They watched the mother. But maybe its grandmother was sodomized? - We don't suspect that far. But how did they know that a red heifer would be born? - They would pass a glass of red liquid in front of her at the time of mating. Then why was it so expensive? - It had to be a  cow with the propensity to give birth to red heifers.<br />

<br />
Nakdimon wanted to give water to the pilgrims who came to Jerusalem and borrowed twelve wells of water from a Roman nobleman, promising an extraordinary sum of money if he did not return the water. The holidays came and went, but there was no rain, and the payment day was approaching. At the last moment, Nakdimon prayed for rain, and it did come, but the nobleman claimed that the rain had come after the day had ended. Nakdimon then prayed again, and the sun stood, to show that the payment day still continued.<br />

<br />
A woman should not be secluded with an idol-worshipper, even if his wife is with him, because of licentiousness, and a man should not be secluded with an idol-worshipper because of the concern of murder. If traveling together, one should be watchful of the weapons of the idol-worshipper, and one should not bend down before him, lest he smash his skull.<br />
<br />
An Israelite woman should not deliver the child of an idolatress, because she thereby delivers a child for idolatry. However, if she can't find an excuse, she is allowed to do it so as not to provoke enmity. An idolatress may deliver a child of an Israelite woman, provided that others are there to watch her.<br />
<br />
Idol-worshippers and Jewish shepherds of small animals were so lawless that one should neither raise them from a pit nor lower them in. However, informers and evil-doers can even be lowered actively into a pit. This law has also changed; applying it today would only add to violence.<br />

Avodah Zarah 27 – Performing a Risky Operation

<br />
Whether a pagan doctor may circumcise an Israelite is the subject of a disagreement. Rabbi Meir forbids it, because of suspicion of murder or mutilation. Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai allows it, because of “you will surely circumcise” but does not approve of it. Rabbi Yehudah the Prince forbids it and allows only one who is obligated in circumcision to circumcise others, based on “and you (Abraham), keep the covenant.”<br />
<br />
Most of the laws about idol-worshippers are not practically applicable today, but the following discussion is. When one will surely die if left untreated, he can go to a pagan doctor, who may cure him, even though there is a suspicion of murder. In general, one is allowed to make a risky operation, which may have a chance of success, even though by doing so, he may shorten the patient's life. This is derived from the behavior of <a href="http://bible.cc/2_kings/7-4.htm">four lepers during a famine</a>, who decided to submit to the enemy who might have killed them, but who might also let them live.<br />

Avodah Zarah 28 – Going to an Idol-Worshipping Doctor
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ4stxFs6looOktO_nnL0SrjatBtN8VD90Zf6rDORQV3_5PVYrpAFVu2Msemj4XLFBms6eNdsF1cbLAeq87DiQlbp0Ol4skXbou4t5ZNiymbJPPCL4JFWIDTdNpvQIdmqTS4uOU87g7vQ/s1600/Edouard+%28Jean-Edouard%29+Vuillard+-+Doctor+Viau+in+his+Surgery.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQ4stxFs6looOktO_nnL0SrjatBtN8VD90Zf6rDORQV3_5PVYrpAFVu2Msemj4XLFBms6eNdsF1cbLAeq87DiQlbp0Ol4skXbou4t5ZNiymbJPPCL4JFWIDTdNpvQIdmqTS4uOU87g7vQ/s320/Edouard+%28Jean-Edouard%29+Vuillard+-+Doctor+Viau+in+his+Surgery.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">It is assumed that a pagan doctor will try to kill a Jewish patient if he can. However, there are gradations. He will not hesitate to let a critically ill Jewish patient die, since this will not harm his reputation. He may also kill a healthy patient, since other pagans will understand that he did it out of malice, not incompetence. Accordingly, one with a non life-threatening illness may go to a pagan doctor.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan suffered from a sickness called tzafdina, a tooth ailment. He went to a certain idolatrous noblewoman for treatment. She made him a remedy on Thursday and Friday, but on Saturday he could not come, because of many students, and asked for a recipe. She said, “Swear that you will not reveal it to anyone!” He said, “To the God of Israel I will not reveal” (but to the people I will), then taught it in public. But he swore?!? - He explained to her the trick right away. Some say that she committed suicide, but some say that she converted, impressed with Rabbi Yochanan's selflessness.<br />
<br />
Now, seeing that Rabbi Yochanan was ready to take the medicine on Saturday, it must have been a life-threatening disease, and if so, how was he allowed to go to an idolatrous doctor? - Rabbi Yochanan was a distinguished person whom the doctor would be afraid to harm.<br />

Avodah Zarah 29 - Prohibition of the Wine and Cheese of Idolaters

Wine is prohibited because of two reasons: it may have been poured for idol worship, and it leads to socializing and intermarriage.<br />
<br />
Cheese of idol worshippers – Rabbi Meir considers it prohibited for any benefit, but the Sages forbid only eating it.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua while they were traveling on the road, “Why did the Sages prohibit the cheeses of idol worshippers?” Rabbi Yehoshua answered, “Because they use the rennet of animals that was not properly slaughtered.” “But a sacrifice is stricter, and its rennet is not prohibited!” “Because they curdle it with the rennet of the calves of idol worship,” - said Rabbi Yehoshua. “But then it should be prohibited for benefit, and it's not!?” Instead of answering, Rabbi Yehoshua diverted the conversation to another topic, about the correct reading of “...<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3001.htm">since your love it better than wine</a>” from the Song of Songs.<br />

Avodah Zarah 3 - A Second Chance in Torah for the Nations

All the nations will come in disarray and demand a reward. God will tell them to come back in order, and the first one will be the Roman Empire.<br />
<br />
It will claim that it built marketplaces, fought wars, and amassed wealth, so that the Jews could study Torah. But God will reply to them that they built marketplaces to put prostitutes there, fought wars for their own benefit, and that gold belongs to Him anyway.<br />
<br />
The same will happen with other nations. However, since God does not act treacherously, He will offer them another chance at the Torah and ask them to fulfill one easy mitzvah: Sukkah. Immediately, everyone will build a sukkah on his roof. God will make the sun blast down on it, and they will kick the sukkah and leave, thus losing their chance.<br />
<br />
But didn't we say that God does not act treacherously? Why did He force them out of the sukkah with the burning sun? - That was fair, because Jews also sometimes have to sit in the sukkah in hot months. But if it is uncomfortably hot, the law is that the person should leave the sukkah! That is true, and the Jews also leave the sukkah, but they don't kick it, unlike the nations, who do.<br />

Avodah Zarah 30 – Cooked Wine and Wine Left Uncovered

<br />
The Sages prohibited the consumption of wine, water, or milk that was left uncovered, for fear that a snake may have drunk from the liquid and cast its venom into it. The prohibition is based on the <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">requirement to take great care of one's health and well-being</a>. Today, when snakes are not prevalent, the prohibition does not apply, though some say that it has additional mystical connotations. In any case, it does not apply to cooked wine, because a snake would never drink such wine.<br />

However, if it was only deposited in the idolater's house, it is prohibited to drink it, but benefit is allowed.<br />
<br />
But why should this be? If we suspect that he touched it or exchanged it for his own, then it should be prohibited even for benefit. And we don't suspect this, then it should be permitted even to drink it! The answer is that the Jew has put his seal on the wine, and the idolater designated a corner where the wine was stored. The combination of the seal and the fear of being discovered makes it not worth his while to try to access the wine. <br />
<br />
In general, the proper procedure for guarding the wine, for example, in the situation when the idolater is on the road with it and is unobserved, is to protect it with a double seal, which is hard to forge.<br />

What is it? The Roman Emperor Hadrian (who crushed Bar Kochba's revolt) found virgin land that was never cultivated. He planted grapevines there and produced extremely strong wine. He placed this wine in new jars, and the jugs absorbed their wine. Hadrian's soldiers would break the jugs into shards and take them on their military campaigns. Wherever they arrived, they would soak the shards in water, thereby reconstituting wine, and then drink it. Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, “Our first quality wine is equivalent to their third soaking of these shards.”<br />
<br />
A question was asked, “Can one support the legs of a bed with these shards?” A Jew should have no connection with idol worship. Here he wants the shards, but not the wine in them. Nevertheless, the wine is absorbed there. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yochanan argue about this matter, one forbids it, and another allows.<br />
<br />
A skin of an animal that is torn opposite the heart, and has a crust of blood on it, is prohibited, because this is evidence that the skin was pierced while the animal was still alive, for idol worship.<br />

On the other hand, if a Jewish idol-worshipper is going on a pilgrimage, it is permitted to trade with him on the way there, but forbidden when he is coming back. Why is this difference?<br />
<br />
A non-Jewish idol-worshipper will certainly reach his destination and praise his deity for any successful trade. However, when he is coming back, his attitude is that what was – was, and he is not going back to give thanks to his idol again. In contrast, we assume that a Jew going to worship idols will change his mind. However, once there, and idol-worship being a new and fresh experience for him, he gets attached to the idol more than a non-Jew, and certainly will go back to praise the idol for any good deal he finds.<br />
<br />
If wine of an idol-worshipper was stored in a leather or earthenware vessel, the proper cleansing procedure is to fill it with water three times, leaving the water in the vessel for at least twenty-four hours.<br />

Rabbi Akiva went to ask in the Academy, and they told him, “If one was too busy to eat in the morning, he can formally accept a religious fast till the end of the day. The jugs of idol worshippers are permitted after twelve months. Moses served in white garments, since he was not entitled to kohen's garments, but could not use his regular garments either.”<br />
<br />
Fish brine prepared by an idolatrous  householder is forbidden, because they would add wine to it. But if a professional fisherman made it, it is permitted, since he uses the fat of fish and does not add wine.<br />

Avodah Zarah 35 – Real Reason for Prohibiting Cheese of Idol Worshippers

Why? Regarding calves sacrificed for idolatry, the fatter it is the better, and the owner is pleased with the waste expanding its size. With an ox that was stoned, the owner does not care if it is fat or not, and the waste is not part of it.<br />
<br />
This law has direct connection to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/09/avodah-zarah-29-prohibitions-of-wine.html">the cheese prohibition</a>: rennet, being a separate milky substance in the stomach of a ruminant, should not make the cheese prohibited. When <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/09/avodah-zarah-29-prohibitions-of-wine.html">Rabbi Yehoshua avoided saying the reason why the cheese of idolaters is prohibited</a>, he did so because a year had not yet passed since the decree was promulgated, and he did not want people to argue about its reasons. That is why he hinted to a <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3001.htm">kiss that seals the lips</a>. The two most prominent reasons are the snake venom in the milk and using the actual meat part of an animal (maw). Tosafot say that now the snakes are not prevalent and the cheese is permitted, but Rashi and others disagree.<br />

Avodah Zarah 36 – Milk, Bread, and Oil of Idolaters

Although the milk of a kosher animal is white, and that of a non-kosher animal is yellowish, if some amount of non-kosher milk is added to kosher milk, this will not be easily discernible.<br />
<br />
Bread of an idol worshipper is forbidden because frequent consumption of it may lead to intermarriage. Technically, the bread is kosher, for we can assume that the flavors that it had absorbed are more than a day old, and thus do not make the bread forbidden. Therefore, the bread of commercial bakers, the consumption of which does not lead to socializing, should have been permitted. That is how many people had understood the prohibition, and this absence of complete acceptance by the majority formed the basis for later leniences.<br />
<br />
The oil of idol worshippers was prohibited because using it too can lead to intermarriage. However, since it is a necessary staple, a later court annulled this prohibition.<br />

Said Rabbi Simlai, “Due to the hardships that the people are having, you should have permitted also the bread of idol worshippers!” Replied Rabbi Yehudah, “Were we to do so, they would call us 'a permitting court'!” He gave an example of Rabbi Yose ben Yoezer, who testified that the "ayal" species of grasshoppers was kosher, that the liquids in the Temple were considered ritually pure, and that one who touched someone who had in turn touched a corpse was pure – and they called him “Yosef The Permitter.” <br />

And Rabbi Simlai, what does he think? That Yose ben Yoezer permitted three things, but Rabbi Yehudah Nesiah – only two. And Rabbi Yehudah? He says that they have already issued a second permissive decree.<br />

Why? - Because the Jews sent a message to Sichon, King of the Amorites, "<a href="http://www.blogger.com/%20http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/2-28.htm">We will buy your food and eat, and buy your water and drink.</a>" This means that they will only eat food that has not changed from its raw state, just like water. But if so, then parched grains made by idolaters should be forbidden, and we know that they are allowed?! - Rather, this Torah phrase serves only as a hint, and the prohibition is Rabbinical.<br />
<br />
If a Jew takes part in the cooking processes, whether in the beginning, the middle, or the end, the food is no longer prohibited, even though the rest of the cooking was done by an idolater. While baking bread, even if a Jew throws one chip of wood into the fire, the bread is no longer prohibited as cooked by an idolater. Whether throwing in a chip of wood is sufficient for foods other than bread is a subject of disagreement.<br />

Nevertheless, one needs to buy it from a trustworthy seller, who can distinguish it from similar non-kosher fish and take the non-kosher ones out. If it has fins and scales but looses them when it is caught, it is also kosher.<br />
<br />
A knife that was used for cutting a non-kosher fish should not be used for cutting kosher fish. Even though the flavor added by the knife, if it is detrimental to the taste, would not make the fish forbidden, in this case it enhances the taste.<br />
<br />
A servant of Rabbi Levi used to re-sell food products and was considered trustworthy. After Rabbi Levi died, Rabbi Yochanan said, “A servant of a trustworthy person remains trustworthy even after the master's death – unless proven otherwise.” In the same way the wife of a trustworthy person is just as trustworthy as her husband.<br />

His anger lasts 1/53848th of an hour, and this is a "moment," mentioned in Psalms as "His anger is but a moment."<br />
<br />
No creature can precisely know this moment, except for the wicked prophet Balaam, about whom the Torah says, "one who knows the mind of the Supreme One." But how could that be? Balaam did not even know the mind of an animal! <br />
<br />
When the Moabite emissaries saw Balaam riding on a donkey, they asked him, "Why do you not ride a horse?" He answered, "Usually I ride a horse. Today I am riding a donkey for the first time, because I put my horses in the marshland to graze."<br />
<br />
The she-donkey said to him, "Am I not your she-donkey?" Balaam said, "To carry loads." She, however, replied, "That you have ridden on me." He said, "Occasionally," and she replied, "All your life until this day! And not only that, but I provide you with riding by day and with marital acts at night!"<br />
<br />
Rather, Balaam knew the moment when God was angry and was trying to say the word "kelim," or "destroy them," at this moment, but it became "Melech," or "king," in his mouth.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">If a fish comes to us broken into pieces, then in order to ascertain that it is kosher, we need both the head and the spine to be discernible – so says Rav Huna, but Rav Nachman requires either the head or the spine.<br />
<br />
The fatty innards of fish and their roe (caviar) may be bought only from an expert in identifying kosher fish, scrupulous in the laws of kashrut. If no expert is available, then if the Jewish seller says, “I personally salted the fish and saw that they were kosher fish, and it was from those very fish that I removed the innards, - he is believed, because were the innards taken to an expert and found to be non-kosher, he would have not way to defend himself. That is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah.<br />
<br />
Rav Nachman requires the seller to show the fish. That is because the seller might not be an expert and thus, without intentionally lying, still be mistaken. However, Rav Yehudah ruled in practice according to his view that as long as he says, “I personally salted the fish,” the caviar is permitted, and ruling in practice determines the law.<br />

What is one to do with images whose history – whether they were used for idolatry or served as ornamentations – is not known? According to Rabbi Meir, all images are prohibited, because they are worshipped at least once a year on a specific date. But the Sages say that all images are permitted, except one that has in its hand a staff, a bird, or a sphere.<br />
<br />
The above disagreement only applies to larger cities, whose dwellers have enough money to create images for the sake of art. However, those in the villages are always prohibited, since they are only made with the utilitarian purpose of idol worship.<br />

If an idol is known to have been broken on its own – for example, if it fell from a roof – then Rabbi Yochanan said that it is prohibited for benefit, but Resh Lakish said that it is permitted. According to Rabbi Yochanan, fragments are forbidden because no idol worshipper nullified them. But according to Resh Lakish, he did nullify it, reasoning that if the idol cannot protect itself, surely it cannot protect anybody else.<br />

How do they both explain <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/5-4.htm">the story of Dagon</a>? It had a body of a fish and the head, hands, and feet of a human.

The customarily worshipped figures are those of a crowned king seated in a chariot – representing the sun, a similar allegorical figure of a moon, or a dragon – which some interpret as a serpent. The highly saline waters of the Dead Sea are not navigated by men, and there is little risk of anyone recovering and enjoying them. Rabbi Yehudah adds an image of a nursing woman, which was worshipped because of Eve, who nursed the entire world.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar HaKappar once found a ring with a dragon on it. He found an adult idolater and forced him to nullify the idol. We see from here that a Jew cannot nullify an idol, that an adult idol worshipper can nullify even an idol that is not his, and even under duress.<br />
<br />
All this refers to using a found object, but prohibitions for a Jew to create an image are stricter, and one has to avoid even a suspicion of idol worship.<br />

Proclos the Philosopher inquired of Rabban Gamliel while the latter was bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite, “It is written in your Torah that nothing of the banned property shall adhere to your hand, why then do you bathe in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?” Rabban Gamliel first said that one may not answer in a bathhouse. After he left, he said, “I did not come into her domain, rather, she came into my domain. Furthermore, she is an adornment to the bathhouse, not the other way around. And we treat her not like god is permitted to be treated by standing here naked and urinating, therefore, she is not an idol that is prohibited.”<br />

Avodah Zarah 45 – Worshipping Mountains and Hills

The same is true when a Jew worships them, but the ruling follows the language of the Torah describing idol worship. However, the adornments of silver and gold on them become prohibited.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose HaGlili explains that when the Torah says, “Their gods on the mountains,” it also teaches that the mountain themselves are not gods. If so, continues Rabbi Yose, why do we find that a tree that was worshipped is prohibited? - Because man's hands are involved in its growth.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose seems to agree with the first teacher, and if so, why did he speak up? Usually people only voice disagreements! - There is a disagreement here too: if the tree was first planted and afterwards worshipped, and not planted for worship from the start, then Rabbi Yose prohibits what grows on it after worship, but the first Sage allows this after-growth. <br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva says that by enumerating mountains, hills, and trees, the Torah is also telling to search for an idol at each such place. When one uproots an idol, he has to plow the place.<br />

Avodah Zarah 46 – Bowing Down to an Egg Stood on One End

The reason for them to be permitted is that they are analogous to a mountain. Just as a mountain which has not been affected by the hand of man remains permitted, so too the stones. The reason for them to be prohibited is that the phrase “You shall surely loathe it” denies the above analogy.<br />
<br />
This argument is connected to the following one: if one stood an egg upright in order to bow down to it, what is the law? If he did bow down to the egg, it is surely prohibited. The situation here is that the Jew stood the egg up, but before he had a chance to bow down to it, an idolater came and worshipped it. Standing up an egg is impermanent. Does it clearly demonstrate the Jew's desire to worship it, in which case it would be prohibited, or is it just an object in the possession of the Jew, in which case the non-Jew cannot forbid it by bowing down to an object that is not his? This question stands unresolved.<br />

Does the change in the worshipped object remove the prohibited status? Can we derive the answer from a well-known law that for all animals that were prohibited to be offered on the Altar, such if they were worshipped or sodomized, their offspring are permitted to be offered? - No, we cannot derive the answer from here, for perhaps this latter law only applies when they were first sodomized, and then became pregnant, so it is not the same situation of change.<br />
<br />
If one bows down to a palm tree, can its branches be used for the mitzvah of Lulav on Succot? Is the mitzvah requirement much less stringent than the Temple?<br />
<br />
If one bows down to a sheep, can its wool be used for the mitzvah of blue wool in tzitzit? <br />
<br />
If one bows down to a spring, can its water be still used for libations on the Alter on Succot? Is he worshipping his own reflection, the water that is now in front of him, or the current itself?<br />
<br />
All these questions remain unanswered.<br />

What should he do? He withdraws four steps into his property and builds the wall there, but to prevent the idol from benefit, he uses his area as a toilet or plants it with thorn-bushes.<br />
<br />
There are three categories of idolatrous houses. A house that was built for use as an idol is prohibited. If a house was plastered and decorated for idol worship – one removes the additions, and the house is permitted. If an idol was brought into a house and then removed – the house is permitted. <br />
<br />
Similar laws apply to stones and trees that were worshipped. However, a tree under which there is an idol is a subject of disagreement between Rabbi Shimon and the Sages. The Sages forbid it, but Rabbi Shimon allows it if the worship can be attributed to the idol underneath. It once happened in Sidon that Rabbi Shimon told to his followers to examine the heap under a worshiped tree. They found an image there, and he permitted the tree.<br />

If he sat directly under branches or foliage - he is ritually impure, because he was under "the same roof" with offerings to an idol.<br />
<br />
One may plant vegetables under a worshipped tree in the winter, when shade is harmful to them, but not in the summer. Rabbi Yose forbids it even in winter, because the leaves becomes fertilizer for the vegetables. But the exact opposite should be true! Rabbi Yose considers the combination of two causes - forbidden leaves of the worshipped tree and permitted other fertilizers - permitted! Rabbi Yose is only answering the Sages. According to him it is indeed permitted, but he is saying that the Sages should forbid it! And the Sages? The don't prohibit it because the shade is detrimental anyway.<br />
<br />
The branches of the worshipped tree are forbidden for benefit. It he fired a new oven with them, it must be broken. If he baked bread with them, that bread is forbidden. If forbidden bread mixed with other permitted bread, then Rabbi Eliezer says that he may take the monetary value of the benefit to the Dead Sea, and everything becomes permitted. <br />

Had they not sinned, we would not have been born.<br />
<br />
But didn't God show Adam all the generations of men? And isn't it also true that the Messiah will not come until all souls have been reincarnated in physical bodies? Rather, understand Resh Lakish as saying that had they lived forever in a perfect state, we would be considered as nonentities compared to them. <br />
<br />
Another opinion is that the decree of death is irrevocable, and had Jews not sinned, they would be free from any foreign domination, but would still remain mortal. It is based on "Observe the Torah, so that it will be good for you" - but not so that you would be immortal. And Resh Lakish answers that the decree of "death" can be fulfilled through being poor, because four are considered as dead: a poor, a blind, a leper, and one without children.<br />

Often, it was symbolized by a heap of stones – minimally, one stone perched on top of two, crudely representing head and two arms. Passing idolaters would worship this idol by tossing stones at the heap. These additional stones were forbidden for benefit, either because they were offerings to the Markulis, or because they were an enlargement of the original Markulis.<br />
<br />
What is the law in regard to the stones found in the vicinity of, but unattached to, a Markulis? Rabbi Yishmael says that three stones found one next to another are forbidden - because they represent a miniature Markulis – but two are permitted. The Sages, however, say that the idol worshippers do not make miniature Markulis, rather, those stones that appear to be with it are forbidden, others are permitted.<br />

Breaking the rod is similar to slaughtering a sacrifice. Even though throwing a stick is similar to another Temple service – throwing of the blood on the Altar – it is not close enough.<br />
<br />
If on top of Markulis one found coins, a garment or utensils – they are permitted, as long as they are placed in such as manner that they cannot be considered adornments. Real adornments would be prohibited, unless nullified by an idolater. However, if he found vines bearing clusters of grapes, wreaths of grain, or glass jars with wines, oils and fine flours – or anything the likes of which was brought on the Temple Altar – it is prohibited to use, because they are presumed to be offerings to the idol.<br />

Rather, the profits from the bath go to support the priest of the idol. Can one benefit from the bath which is the property of the idol? Since idol cannot own property, the rule is that “there is no consecration of property to an idol,” and the bath is allowed to be used. However, one is not allowed to pay the priest, since his payment goes to their support. Some opine that one is allowed to pay but not to express gratitude to the priests – so that one does not come to be influenced by them.<br />
<br />
An idol of a non-Jewish idol worshipper becomes prohibited immediately after he forms it, but that of  Jewish idol worshipper – only after it is worshipped. However, Rabbi Ishmael gets an opposite result from the phrase, “You shall destroy the places where the nations worshipped their gods,” - which according to him means that they becomes gods only after being worshipped.<br />

He needs to be an adult and of sound mind. A Jew cannot nullify the idol of  a non-Jewish idol-worshipper. If a Jew comes into actual possession of an idol, it cannot be nullified but has to be hidden. That law is from the Torah, derived from the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">And place it in secret.</a>”&nbsp;  However, the Sages have additionally prohibited any idol nullification by a Jew, since he might accidentally pick up it, thus acquiring it, and then his nullification would be invalid.<br />
<br />
How does an idol-worshipper nullify an idol? If he cut off the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, or the tip of finger, or flattened its face – he has nullified it. But if he spit before it, or urinated before it, or dragged it through the mud, or threw excrement at it – the idol is not nullified. If he sold it or gave it as a pledge for a loan, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that his nullification is effective, but the Sages say that it is not.<br />

If, however, they abandoned it in a time of war, it is still prohibited, since they may have left it as a result of confusion.<br />
<br />
Philosophers asked the Jewish Sages in Rome, “If God is not favorably disposed toward an idol, why does He not simply get rid of it?” The Sages answers, “If people worshipped something that the world does not need, God would indeed get rid if it. But behold, they worship the sun, the moon, the stars – should God destroy the world because of fools?”<br />
<br />
The philosophers then said, “If so, let Him destroy every idolatrous object that is not necessary for the world.” The Sages answered, “Then an argument could be made that we are encouraging the worshippers of the sun, moon, etc., for these worshippers will say that theirs' are the true deities, for they were not destroyed while other forms of idolatry have.”<br />

Avodah Zarah 55 – When do Grapes turn into Wine

The Sages have additionally decreed that ordinary wine of idolaters is also forbidden to Jews for all benefit. Furthermore, they decreed that even a Jew's wine becomes prohibited if an idolater touches it.<br />
<br />
Grape juice is in the same category as wine. It does not need to ferment in order to attain the “wine” classification, rather, it needs to have been processed to a point where it can be considered a “finished” product.<br />
<br />
One may buy the contents of a trodden winepress from an idol worshipper, even though the idol worshipper takes crushed grapes from the juice with his hand an places then on the mound. That is the because the liquid is not considered “prohibited wine” until it descends into the cistern. One may work together with the idolater treading the grapes, and it is not considered deriving benefit from forbidden one. However, because it was not allowed to increase ritual impurity in Israel, one was not allowed to harvest the grapes together with an idolater.<br />

Later rulings were stricter with the wine and more lenient with ritual purity. Thus, now the grape juice was forbidden immediately once it began to flow freely out of the grapes, but on the other hand one was allowed to harvest grapes together with an idolater, and there was no concern that the grapes would later become impure. <br />
<br />
However, this leniency applied only to an idolater, because for him there was no requirement of tithes. A Jew was supposed to keep his grapes pure, since later he had to give a portion to a Kohen. Consequently, one was not allowed to harvest grapes together with a Jew if that Jew was going to make them impure – because one should not help people who transgress.<br />

The hands of the idolater did not touch the wine, but his feet obviously did, and Shmuel postponed his ruling on the case until three festivals have passed. Why? It was customary for scholars to assemble at the academy on Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot, and Shmuel waited to find a scholar who would know of a ruling that supported the decision he wanted to render. What could his decision have been?<br />
<br />
There were three opinions on the matter, as follows: if an idol worshipper inserted his hand or foot to measure the wine, obviously not to make a libation, the majority says that it is prohibited for consumption but can be sold; Rabbi Nathan forbids if for benefit if it was touched by hand, but not by foot; Rabbi Shimon allows it for consumption.<br />
<br />
If Shmuel wanted to rule as majority, he did not need any support. He could not rule it forbidden like Rabbi Nathan – because Rabbi Nathan never forbade it when touched by foot. It must therefore be that Shmuel wanted to rule it allowed for consumption like Rabbi Shimon, but needed additional support for this minority opinion.<br />

A waiter, whom they took to be a Jew, came by, and they asked him to pour them a drink. After he poured the wine into theirs cups, it transpired that he was an idol worshipper. One of the Rabbis ruled the wine prohibited even for benefit, while the other one ruled it permitted even for drinking.<br />
<br />
Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, “The one who prohibited did well, and the one who permitted also did well.” <br />
<br />
The one who prohibited reasoned as follows: the idolater thought, “Is it conceivable that such distinguished Rabbis such as these would drink beer? - No! It must be wine!” - and having ascertained this, he intended to make a libation for his idol.<br />
<br />
The one who permitted reasoned as follows: the idolater thought, “It is conceivable that such distinguished Rabbis would be drinking wine and ask me, an idolater, to pour wine for them? - No! It must be beer!” Since he knew that it was wine, he did not make a libation. <br />

<br />
We have<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/10/avodah-zarah-55-when-do-grapes-turn.html"> previously learned</a>  that the juice of grapes cannot be prohibited until they are crushed in the treading basin and the wine begins to flow there. The intent of the question was only if there was some additional restriction by the Sages regarding this. <br />
<br />
Rav Kahana answered that it was indeed prohibited if the carrier also emptied the baskets into the vat, based on the maxim of “Go away! Go away!” we say to a Nazir. In other words, stay far from forbidden items. They asked them, “But we learned that if he did it, the wine is allowed?!” He answered, “I only meant that it should not be done in the first place, but if he did it – the wine is permitted.”<br />
<br />
If an idolater purposely touched the wine, with the intent to make it prohibited for the Jew, then, even though ordinarily one cannot sell this wine anymore, it is permitted to accept the money from the person who touched it – because he is not buying the wine but rather compensating for the damage he has caused.<br />

But why is this? For example, one who sells an animal and its offspring before one of the Jewish holidays must inform the buyer, so that he does not transgress the prohibition of slaughtering a mother and her young on one day – and this prohibition is only one day before the holiday! - The difference is that this animal is purely for eating, but the idolater's case is for a sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Then compare it to the law that one must learn the laws of a Jewish holiday thirty days before the holiday! - In the case of an idolater, the only disqualification is if the animal is missing a limb, and three days are enough, but in the Temple, there are many animal disqualifications.<br />
<br />
So the idolaters took the law of sacrifices to God and applied it to sacrifices to their idols, and are careful that the animal should be intact. What is the source for this law? - Noah was commanded to take whole animals into the Ark, because he would bring some as a sacrifice. But maybe they were not whole? - The Torah says, "With you," meaning, "Like you." But maybe Noah himself was not whole? - That can't be, because then only lame animals would be allowed.<br />

On the other hand, he knows that by touching the wine he will ruin it for the Jew and may have to pay. Therefore, normally it can be assumed that he did not touch the wine, out of fear of being discovered. However, if he has a loan for that wine against the Jew, he can always justify his touching it, and in that case the wine is prohibited for benefit, because of this possibility.<br />
<br />
If an idolater fell into a wine cistern and ascended from it, or he measured it with the reed, or he flicked a hornet out of it with a reed – all of these cases actually happened, and the Sages allowed the wine to be sold to idolaters. Rabbi Shimon permits this wine even for drinking, because it will not lead to socializing. <br />

Until then, he stores it in the idolater’s premises. To make sure that the idolater does not make a libation of this wine, the Jew stores it in a storage room open into the public domain, so that anyone inside can be observed. This helps if the town is inhabited by both Jews and idolaters, and a Jew is likely to look inside at any time. Otherwise, the Jew must appoint a guardian. The guardian does  not need to be there at all time, but can go out and come in intermittently.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the idolater must write a receipt stating, “I have received money from you as a payment for the produce,” so that the wine is in full control of the Jew and he can remove it any time that he wants. The obligation is thus converted to a regular loan, and there is no lien on the wine. With this, the wine is permitted.<br />

In a related incident, the members of the household of Rabbi Yannai borrowed shemittah produce from the poor and repaid them with ordinary produce in the eighth year. They did this to benefit the poor, for it allowed the poor to trade their soon-to-be-unusable shemittah produce and receive usable eighth-year produce in return - since the original produce was no longer extant when the loan was repaid. Thus, unlike the wine case, the connection between produce and payment was broken.<br />
<br />
They asked Rabbi Yochanan is this was done correctly, and he proved that it was, from the laws of a harlot's payment. The rule is that if one gave the harlot an animal in payment and afterward cohabited with her, or if he cohabited with her, and afterward gave her an animal in payment, her payment is permitted, and she can bring it on the Altar. Why? Because at the time she acquires the animal, the cohabitation is no longer extant – and the case of shemittah produce is the same.<br />

Or perhaps, any action to destroy futility (idolatry) is permissible, and certainly the wage is permissible?<br />
<br />
Said Rav Nachman, “Let him break the barrels and may a blessing come upon him!”<br />
<br />
Can we support Rav Nachman from the ruling about mixed seeds: one is not allowed to weed the forbidden seed mixture, because he helps it grow. Rabbi Akiba makes one liable even for passively keeping the mixture. However, one is a allowed to accept a contract to uproot them. Now, this is parallel to the wine case, since for a time the worker wants the seeds to exist - until he uproots them - and it is allowed! This indeed supports Rav Nachman.<br />

<br />
If the wine falls onto figs or dates and there is enough of it to impart flavor, they are forbidden. In this case, the two substances have different tastes, and one can empirically ascertain whether the forbidden flavor is present.  When the two substances taste the same, the permissible ratio is 1/60.<br />
<br />
It once happened to Boethus ben Zunan that he brought dried figs onto a ship. A barrel of libation wine spilled onto them, and he asked the Sages, and they permitted the dried figs. That story does not contradict the rule above, because it is different in this: even though the taste of wine was detectable in the dried figs, it did not improve the taste but rather made it worse, and prohibited flavor that is to the detriment of the taste does not forbid the food.<br />

<br />
If new wine - grape juice within the first thirty days – is mixed with grapes, Abaye says that any amount of wine makes it forbidden, because they have the same taste, and when two foods have the same taste, any amount of forbidden substance makes the mixture forbidden. Rava, however, says that we consider the names, and grapes and wine have different names. Therefore, we consider the two foods different in nature, and if there are 60 times less wine than grapes, the mixture is permitted.<br />
<br />
Conversely, if wine vinegar and beer vinegar become mixed, Abaye says that we follow the taste, and since the two tastes are different, the forbidden one is nullified if there is 60 times more of permitted one. Rava still considers the name, and since both are called vinegar, any amount of forbidden vinegar makes the mixture forbidden.<br />

Avodah Zarah 67 – Forbidden Flavor that Ruins the Dish

<span style="font-size: medium;">Whenever a forbidden substance gets mixed into a kosher dish and it improves the taste of the dish, the result is prohibited; however, when it has an adverse effect on the permitted food, the dish is permitted. The forbidden substance should not be found in large quantities, so that by eating his meal within a short time (about 2-3 minutes), one does not ingest more than an olive volume of the forbidden food. Also, if the prohibited food, when added to a cold dish, improves it, and adds the bad taste only after cooking, the permit does not apply.<br />
<br />
A forbidden food that is absorbed into the walls of a cooking utensil becomes slightly rancid after a day. Since it adds bad flavor to anything cooked in this utensil, it follows that kosher food cooked in it does not become prohibited – this is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Meir, however, says that even when the forbidden flavor is detrimental, it still prohibits the dish.<br />

It stayed there soaking for more than 24 hours, and was therefore considered as if cooked, imparting flavor to the beer. Rav ruled it forbidden.<br />
<br />
The student related this to Rav Sheshet and told him that Rav must consider forbidden flavor that ruins the taste as  forbidden. “Nor necessarily,” - told them Rav Sheshet. In general, Rav may consider such  food permitted. Only here, since people are generally disgusted by mice, the Torah, by prohibiting mice, told us to avoid even its flavor. The students told him that they don't see this logic in such cases as semen, and furthermore, Rav Shimi said that in some places they go on the tables of kings.<br />
<br />
Therefore, Rava concluded that when a forbidden flavor ruins the taste, the dish remains kosher. Here, however, he was not sure why Rav prohibited the beer. It could be that Rav held that bad flavor made it non-kosher, and then the law would not agree with Rav. It could also be that Rav considered the flavor of mouse improving the beer, and in this case the law about prohibited flavor would agree with him.<br />

There was such a case in Rav Kahana's household, and he prohibited it. Do we see from here that the mouse indeed gives a beneficial flavor, and that's why he prohibited it? – No, but in that case small pieces of the mouse remained in vinegar, and since one gets lashes for eating a smaller piece of a mouse than other non-kosher foods, he prohibited it for this reason.<br />
<br />
If an idol worshipper was helping a Jew to transport jugs of wine and the Jew had to leave for some time, then the status of the wine depends on what did the Jew say. If he traveled up to a mile but did not inform the idol worshipper, then the wine is permitted. If, however, he told that he would be going far enough for the idol worshipper to bore a hole, patch it with clay, and for clay to have dried up, the wine is forbidden. Similar guidelines apply to an idol worshipper left on a boat, in a store, or at the table. Note that the final law does not agree with this level of suspicion.<br />

According to him, doing business with the worshippers of the Sun, who dedicated every Sunday to the God of the Sun, is always prohibited.<br />
<br />
However, today these prohibitions no longer apply, because today's idol worshippers perform the rituals only by rote. Moreover,  many societies have adopted a moral code that differs significantly from the lifestyle that idol worship expressly permitted. To emphasize this point, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein referred to American society as a "Government of Benevolence."<br />
<br />
When should one ask for his personal needs, before or after the prayer? Some say, following the example of Moses, that one should begin with praise to God and then ask for one's needs. Others say that for us to follow Moses would be presumptuous. Rather, we should ask for our needs first, which will lead us to realize that we can rely only on God. We will then be in the proper state of mind to pray, whereas Moses did not require this preparation.<br />

On the other hand, if a Jewish harlot is having a meal with idol worshippers, her wine is prohibited, because she will not protest if they pour her wine as libation.<br />
<br />
If an idolater is found standing among the barrels of Jewish wine, then Rava's rule applies: if the idolater has a way to evade a charge of burglary – the wine is forbidden, and if not, the wine is permitted. If an idolater has an alibi to explain why he was found there, he will have the desire and the presence of mind to make a libation. Even if the alibi is not perfect, as long as it saves him from being prosecuted for burglary – this is enough, and he will be willing to take the risk that someone may discover him while  touching the wine. Without an alibi, he will be too nervous to make a libation, and we presume that he entered for a different purpose. The Talmud gives twelve cases explaining this rule.<br />

The sealed barrels, though, are permitted, because the soldiers, being afraid of no one, would not bother resealing the barrels they had broken into. If this occurred during wartime, then both open and sealed barrels are permitted, because the soldiers do not have time to make libations to idols.<br />

Jewish workers, whom their idolatrous employer wants to pay with libation wine, can tell him, “Give us money instead.” However, once the wine entered their possession, they are forbidden to derive benefit from it.<br />

Some say that the same prohibition applies to today's regular wines, but others maintain that nowadays, since idolatrous libations have fallen into disuse, the ordinary wine of non-Jews is prohibited only for drinking but not for benefit.<br />
<br />
A minute quantity of libation wine mixed with kosher wine makes the mixture forbidden for benefit. Again, some say that today this stringency does not apply, and kosher wine is permitted unless the new wine imparts its own flavor to the mixture.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan said that if one pours libation wine, even all day, from a small pitcher into a cistern of kosher wine, each successive drop of libation wine is nullified, and the wine in the cistern is permitted. Not only that, but each nullified drop is now viewed as kosher wine and it turn nullifies subsequent drops of libation wine. <br />

Earlier we learned that any amount of prohibited substance, mixed with its own kind, for example, wine into wine, prohibits the kosher substance. Some say, however, that this stringent rule is true only for libation wine, but for all other substances it is nullified if it is less than one-sixtieth. <br />

Avodah Zarah 74 – Dry Mixtures

When  prohibited substances are mixed with permitted ones of the same kind, for example, prohibited grapes with permitted ones, the prohibited substance becomes nullified in a simple majority, one part in two. When it is mixed with permitted substances of a different kind, for example, grapes and olives, it is nullified in the ratio of one-to-sixty.<br />
<br />
Following is a list of exceptions to the above rule: a sealed barrel of libation wine mixed even with a thousand barrels of kosher wine, an idol, an ox condemned to be stoned, red heifer, birds offered by a person cured from tzaraat, hair of a nazir, firstborn male donkey, a piece of meat cooked with milk, Yom Kippur goat sent to Azazel, and unconsecrated animals slaughtered in the Temple Courtyard. All these, mixed with any amount of similar items, make the whole group prohibited.<br />

Avodah Zarah 75 – Purifying Winepress and Vessels
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBT-7v-JzXFa1Y21WKEHaSFJJ-0k9BK-1ljrBTRudmer-UZ8bcFDMjcKRy_pkUnxG0Dt5c370zu4BgqZUDX2ShPJN36Tyc_BeDbX8ZXcs5-doVM_7F2hMLN5oyBflBPtll9zQjaWkm8Ac/s1600/Felix+Edouard+Vallotto+-+Still+Life+with+Large+Earthenware+Jug.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBT-7v-JzXFa1Y21WKEHaSFJJ-0k9BK-1ljrBTRudmer-UZ8bcFDMjcKRy_pkUnxG0Dt5c370zu4BgqZUDX2ShPJN36Tyc_BeDbX8ZXcs5-doVM_7F2hMLN5oyBflBPtll9zQjaWkm8Ac/s320/Felix+Edouard+Vallotto+-+Still+Life+with+Large+Earthenware+Jug.jpg" width="251" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">A stone winepress was usually covered with hot pitch, but to counteract the effect of fumes, wine was added to the pitch. Therefore, an idol worshipper's winepress could not be used by a Jew, but first had to be “dried.” Drying meant purifying it with water and ashes. If the winepress was made of wood, which required more pitch, then Rabbi Yehudah the Prince still says that all that is necessary is that it be “dried,” but the Sages require removing the pitch. If it was made of earthenware, then even if he removed the pitch, it is still prohibited, because earthenware walls absorb more wine.<br />
<br />
If one buys food utensils from idol worshippers, then the utensils that are used only with cold food require only an immersion in the mikveh. Those that are used with hot liquids are purified in hot water. Those that are used with fire without liquid are purged in a flame. The spit and grill are purged in a flame.<br />

Avodah Zarah 76 – Purifying a Knife

Rav Ukva bar Chama explained this to mean that he sticks the knife into the ground ten times. In addition, the ground has to be hard and not ploughed, and the knife – smooth, without dents. This only suffices to purify the knife to be used with cold foods.<br />
<br />
Mar Yehudah and Bati bar Tuvi were sitting at a meal with the Persian king Shapoor. They brought an etrog to the king. The king sliced a piece and ate it. Then he sliced a piece and handed it to Bati. Then he stood up and stuck the knife into the ground ten times, cut a piece, and gave it to Mar Yehuda. Bati took offence and said, “And this person (meaning himself), is he not a Jew?” The king answered, “I  know about Mar Yehudah that he is observant, but I don't know this about you.” <br />
<br />
In another version the king said, “Remember what you did last night?” It was a custom to send the guest a woman, and Mar Yehudah did not accept his gift, but Bati did. In truth, Bati was a half-slave, and he was allowed to have relations with that woman who was non-Jewish, but the king did not know that.<br />

The festival of Calenda is celebrated for eight consecutive days following the winter solstice, which is the shortest day of the year. In contrast, Saturnalia is celebrated for eight days leading up to the winter solstice. The mnemonic to remember that the first festival is mentioned last is "<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/139-5.htm">Later and earlier You formed me</a>."<br />
<br />When Adam, the first man, saw the days decreasing in winter, he said, "Woe is to me! This is the death that has been decreed upon me!" He then engaged in fasting and prayer for eight days. When, after the winter solstice, he saw that the days began increasing, he said, "This is the way of the world!" and established eight days of festivities. The following year he established both eight-day periods as festival days. Although he intended for the sake of Heaven, later generations dedicated them for the sake of idolatry.<br />

There were two victories, one in the time of Cleopatra and before that, against the Greeks.<br />
<br />
The Romans fought thirty-two battles against the Greeks but were unable to overcome them until they accepted Israel as a partner. They then sent a message to the Greeks: "Until now we were fighting with weapons, but now let's reason. If one has a carbuncle and a Torah scroll, which one should be made into a setting for the other?" The Greeks replied, "The carbuncle should be the setting for the Torah scroll." The Romans then replied, "If so, we have a Torah scroll with us, for Israel is with us." Then, they went ahead and defeated the Greeks.<br />
<br />The Romans promised to treat Israel as a partner, but after twenty-six years, they subjugated Israel. What was their logic?&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">At first, they relied on "<a href="" target="_blank">I will proceed alongside you</a>," implying a partnership between Esau (Rome) and Jacob.</span>&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But later, they expounded, "<a href="" target="_blank">Let my master go ahead of his servant</a>," which indicates that Esau (Rome) is the leader.</span><br />

The standard width of a private path is 4 amot (6 ft), the public thoroughfare is 16, and the standing ceremony is 4 kavs (60x60 ft). As people were walking from the cemetery, the leader would say, "Stand, dear ones, stand." Then he would say, "Sit, dear ones, sit," and they would sit and bemoan their loss.

First, a subterranean chamber was dug. Recesses were then dug into the walls of the chamber, and the dead were placed in these recesses. Catacombs serving as family burial places contained several chambers with multiple recesses.<br />
<br />
One who sells a lot to his fellow to build a catacomb for him upon it, or one who accepts a contract to make such a catacomb, must adhere to the following standards: each crypt has to be 4x6 amot; he must open eight recesses, three on one side, three on another, and two in the middle opposite the door; the length of each recess must be eight amot, and the height must be seven hand-breadths. Rabbi Shimon says, 4x8 amot. An amah (arm) is between 1.5 and 2 feet.</span><br />

If the buyer later measures and finds it to be less, the seller must refund him the missing amount. <br />
<br />
Although in the sale of movable items, a slight deviation voids the purchase, the Sages assessed that in the case of real estate, the buyer wants the sale to stand, even if the quantity is slightly more or less, as long as he is compensated for the difference. If the seller gave him more than a beit kor, the buyer has to return the excess land. If the seller said, "beit kor, be it less or more," the sale stands, provided the discrepancy is no more than 1/24.<br />

The second statement nullifies the first. If it was uttered after a while, it is definitely a retraction. Even if it was uttered immediately, we assume he changed his mind. These are the words of Ben Nannas.<br />
<br />
However, the Sages say that since he added nothing to clarify his retraction, this may indicate that he understood the contradiction, returned to the first statement, and decided to stop talking to avoid further mistakes. Therefore, the statement giving the seller the smaller amount is operative, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/11/bava-batra-92-implied-warranty.html">keeping the money in dispute in the hands of the current owner</a>.</span><br />

"Within these landmarks and boundaries" means selling as is, regardless of size. The fact that he added the field size compels him to at least come close to this size.<br />
<br />
If the field was found to be of a different size, then if the difference is less than a sixth, the field becomes the buyer's without any adjustment. If the difference is more significant than a sixth, they must adjust, with the seller or the buyer paying the difference.<br />

Inheritors are considered to have bought their respective portions from each other, so it was a mistaken sale, and they will have to redivide. The same law applies when their father's creditor collects land from one of the brothers.<br />
<br />
If three judges came to appraise land belonging to orphans to satisfy their debts and disagreed about its value, claiming respective values of 80, 105, and 120, the land would be worth 105. Two against one would consider it worth less than 105, and two against one would consider it worth more than 105. Other approaches include throwing away the highest value or considering that the judge mentally adjusts his estimate to be closer to his friends' numbers.<br />

The primary succession of heirs is thus as follows: a man's primary heir is his son. The estate reverts to the deceased man's daughter if there is no son. After this, the next eligible heir is the deceased's father, and if there is no living father, the estate reverts to that father's own heirs.<br />
<br />
There are persons who can inherit and bequeath possessions, such as a son, who can inherit from his father but also bequeath to him. Some inherit but do not bequeath—such as a son and his mother: he can inherit from her, but the mother does not inherit from her son. <br />

<br />
The passages of the Torah describing the laws of inheritance do not mention the deceased's father at all. However, in the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-11.htm">You shall give his inheritance to HIS RELATIVE who is closest to him of his family</a>," "his relative" means the deceased's father. Now that we see that the father is mentioned, his place in the inheritance chain is right after the children because one's father is considered a closer relative to him than his siblings.<br />
<br />
If so, why is the father not mentioned explicitly?

This implies that the daughter would inherit because the deceased has no son, but if he had a son, the son would precede her.<br />
<br />
Brothers inherit from each other and bequeath to each other – provided they are brothers from the same father. Brothers related only through their mother are not connected for inheritance. This is derived from "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/1-2.htm">according to their families, according to their fathers' households</a>." <br /><br />

<br />
However, we have the following a-forteriori (kal vachomer) argument: "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-8.htm">Any daughter who inherits  a legacy from the tribes of the children of Israel</a>" refers to the inheritance coming to a daughter from her mother. Now, the daughter does not inherit from her father but nevertheless inherits from her mother. The son, who inherits from his father, surely inherits from his father and even preempts the daughter.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Zecharia Hakatzav says that an a-forteriori argument cannot give  the son more rights than the daughter, and they should share in the inheritance equally. However, the final law does not follow him.<br />

<br />
Abaye asked him, - Could it be that the one who dies by day has his sons inherit his property, but the one who dies by night does not? Of course not! Rather, since it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-11.htm">this should be to the children of Israel as a statute of judgment</a>," inheritance has the laws of a court case. For example, suppose three people visit a sick person who instructs them concerning his last will. In that case, they have two options: write it down as witnesses or act as court judges and execute the judgment – but only by day since all court cases must be started by day.<br />

<br />
Whenever this happens, parties are entitled to retract for a certain period. For how long? Rabbah said, "As long as they are seated at the same location." Rav Yosef said, "As long as they discuss the same subject."<br />
<br />
However, both Rabbah and Rav Yosef need help with the rule learned previously about a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-113-inheritance-to-be.html" target="_blank">court executing the last will</a>. If a sick person can retract, none of their decisions are valid! Rav Yosef answers that this rule only applies while they are still discussing inheritance.<br />

Moreover, all the descendants of a son take precedence over a daughter. <br />
<br />
However, a daughter takes precedence over the deceased's brothers (her uncles), and the descendants of a daughter take precedence over brothers. The daughter also precedes the deceased's father (her grandfather).<br />
<br />
This is the rule: whoever takes precedence in the inheritance, his descendants also take precedence, and the father takes precedence over all his descendants – because the deceased's brothers are related to him through their common father.<br />

Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, "Whoever does not leave behind a son to inherit him, the Holy One, Blessed be He is full of anger toward him." <br />
<br />
From where do we know this? "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">If a man dies and he has no son, and you will pass (veha'avartem) his inheritance</a>" and "evrah" means a day of anger, as in "<a href="http://bible.cc/zephaniah/1-15.htm">a day of anger</a>."<br />
<br />
But is it a son or a student? Since Rabbi Yochanan lost his ten sons and would console people with "Look, this is a bone of my last son," - it must be that he meant a student, for otherwise, he would not publicize that God was angry with him. Then why did he say "son?" - These were the words of his teacher, but he himself felt that a man must leave a student.<br />

However, if they are not considered for inheritance, they should likewise not be considered for yibum (levirate marriage) – and then their mother should be married to a brother of Tzelophchad, who would receive Tzelophchad's portion, thus bringing it back to the family.<br />
<br />
Moses had to ask God, and their petition was granted. Moses would have written this part of the law anyway, but they were meritorious and thus deserved that it was written through them – because of their love for the Land of Israel.<br />

This was true, however, only for the first generation after entry because it is introduced with "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-6.htm">this is the thing that God has commanded</a>," which teaches that this "thing" applies only to this generation. The reason was to encourage the Jews who entered the Land to conquer all of it from the Canaanite inhabitants - and not get it through marriage.<br />
<br />
The daughters of Tzelophchad were given the same commandment, but for them, it was just good advice – because they were <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-4.htm">wise</a>, <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-4.htm">expounders of the Torah</a>, and <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-6.htm">righteous</a>.

<br />
The answer comes from the phrase "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">and it shall be on the day that he bequeaths to his sons</a>..." This phrase is superfluous since the law it states – that the firstborn gets a double portion – is expressed in different words in the very next verse. Therefore, the superfluous phrase teaches that the other brothers – if there are more than one – get at least as much as the firstborn, that is, at least 1/2, which is more than 1/3. Now that the 2/3 possibility is out, the only remaining logical alternative is that the firstborn gets double the portion of each brother.<br />

<i>Rebbi</i>: the firstborn takes a double portion of those benefits that happen automatically, but not those that the orphans brought to the estate through their actions.<br />
<br />
What are their arguments?<br />
<br />
<i>Rabbis</i>: the expression "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">to give him the double portion</a>..." compares the double portion to a gift. Just as a gift cannot be given unless it has come into the donor's possession, so does the double portion, which includes only present assets.<br />
<br />
<i>Rebbi</i>: The words "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">double portion</a>..." make the law for both portions the same, including future automatic benefits.<br />

The donor had an only daughter, who was married, but she died during the lifetime of her husband and her father's grandmother, and then the husband came forward and claimed the estate.<br />
<br />
Ran Huna said, "To my heirs" means "even to the heirs of my heirs," and so the husband inherits. Ran Anan said, "To my heirs" means "but not to the heirs of my heirs," so the husband does not inherit. And the law is like Rav Anan, but not for his reason. Rather, the husband does not inherit here because it is only a prospective asset for him since the grandmother could have prevented the inheritance by selling the property.<br />

<br />
However, suppose one distributes his property before his death, increasing the share of one and decreasing the share of the other or making the portion of the firstborn equal to those of the other brothers. In that case, his words stand because he conveyed the portions of his estate as gifts rather than bequests.<br />
<br />
If at any point in a document, whether at the beginning, the middle, or the end, one wrote that the awards are conveyed as "gifts," even though the document also contains language of inheritance, his words stand. <br />

The phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">he must recognize the firstborn</a>" is superfluous, and it is interpreted to mean that the father can identify the firstborn to others, that is, help them recognize the firstborn.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />If two sons were born in hiding, and it is not clear who the firstborn is, they can appoint each other as agents against other brothers and together win the portion of the firstborn – so was Rava's advice. They told Rava that even though it sounded logical, the Torah insisted on definite knowledge about a firstborn. Rabbi Yannai explained this to be valid only when the firstborn was known and then mixed up. The next day, Rava publicly announced: "The statement that I made previously was an error on my part."<br />

<br />
When the first beneficiary dies, the second beneficiary acquires the property. When the second beneficiary dies, the third beneficiary acquires the property. If the second beneficiary dies during the lifetime of the first one, the property reverts to the heirs of the first beneficiary upon his death.<br />
<br />
Even though the award was referred to as "inheritance,"  it was only valid because he "gave" to the first one. Thus, when the second beneficiary died, he could not "give" anything to the third one, and the regular order of inheritance was restored.<br />

However, if he increased the portion of one son among the other sons, or one daughter among the other daughters, or completely eliminated the portion of one son, leaving everything for the other sons, his words stand.

Neither. While learning, the Sage may not have considered all aspects of the matter. On the other hand, a practical ruling may be misunderstood by the observer as to the reason behind it. Rather, the Sage has to declare that the law agrees with a particular view and that it is to be followed in practice.<br />
<br />
Is the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-130-power-to-change.html">ruling about changes in inheritance</a> true for someone on his deathbed, because of "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">on the day when he makes his sons inherit</a>," or even for one who is young and healthy?

Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: "If his children were not conducting themselves properly, he is remembered for good." Does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explain the ruling or argue against it? <br />

The sons of one man did not conduct themselves properly, and he left all his possessions to Yonathan ben Uziel, who, in turn, sold a third, donated another third to the Temple, and returned the rest to the sons of the donor.

If one says, "This is my brother," - the other brothers don't have to believe him and share their inheritance with the newcomer. The one who recognized the brother, however, is obligated to share in the inheritance. If the newly known brother dies, his properties revert to the one who identified him but are not shared with other brothers.

Unless a formal acquisition act was made before the person's death, his property automatically passes to the rightful heirs defined by the Torah. The Sages, however, decreed that a seriously ill person can transfer his property to others by verbal declaration alone. They did it out of concern that a seriously ill person, fearing that his end was near, might deteriorate further if he were unable to arrange his affairs. Thus, his words take effect, and the gift takes effect upon his death.<br />
<br />
This person, who prepared a will, did not use the verbal declaration method above, and after his death, neither he nor his documents can effect acquisitions.<br />

Bava Batra 136 – A Will of a Healthy Person

However, one way to accomplish property transfer is to give over the title to the possessions now but the right to use them only after death.<br />
<br />
When one writes his properties over to his sons for use after death, he must indicate this by including the clause "from today and after death," - says Rabbi Yehudah. But Rabbi Yossi says that it is enough to write "after death," and the date on the document indicates that he means "from today."<br />
<br />
In such a case, the father cannot sell the properties completely because they are written over to his son, and the son cannot sell them because they are in the father's possession.<br />

Resh Lakish says that the buyer does acquire them. Rabbi Yochanan considers the ownership of the rights to the produce tantamount to ownership of the property itself. Therefore, the father, who uses the property and is the primary owner, prevents the sale. Resh Lakish disagrees with this premise.<br />
<br />
If one says, "My property shall go to you, and after you to so-and-so," then the first can sell it, and the second has no recourse. However, initially, the first one should not sell it. One who gives him advice to sell, since after the fact the second one has no recourse, is called a "smart bad person."</span><br />

<br />
If the recipient was at first silent and later protested, his protest is invalid, and he remains in the possession of the gift.<br />
<br />
If the donor asked a third party to acquire the gift on behalf of the recipient, the acquisition act is valid since it is assumed that most people want gifts. If the recipient was at first silent and then protested, then some say that he acquired the gift, but some say that perhaps he saw no need to protest until the gift actually reached his hands, and thus, the situation is in doubt.<br />

<br />
According to Biblical law, a person survived by his sons and daughters is inherited only by his sons. The Sages, however, instituted that a man stipulate to his wife in her marriage contract (ketubah) that their daughters who survive him be entitled to support from his estate until they marry or reach full maturity.<br />
<br />
Admon says, "Because I am male, do I lose?" Rabban Gamliel prefers his opinion, but the final law follows the first authority—the daughters take priority.<br />

So the man prefers a daughter? But we learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-116-man-who-leaves-not-son.html">one should leave a son</a>!

<br />
But how can an unborn child acquire a gift?

And if you question this from <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_batra/bava_batra141.html">the Mishna which validated such an acquisition</a>, that Mishna was talking about one's own children. Since one feels especially close to them, his resolve to give is strong enough, but this is not so for someone else's children.<br />
<br />
But what about a contradicting rule that "A one-year-old baby inherits and bequeaths," from which we understand that a fetus does not inherit? That rule is talking about a different situation – an inheritance that passes to the baby from his mother and from him - to his paternal brothers. This type of inheritance cannot pass through an unborn child.<br />

Rav Sheshet's proof: if one separates the tithe from a vegetable with a bitter interior, he must add to his tithe from a sweet section. The sweet part is "you," and the bitter part is "the donkey," and since the tithe took effect, we see that the recipient gets all.<br />
<br />
Talmud argues for Rav Sheshet: <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-50-betrothal-by-liar.html">A man betrothed five women jointly with one basket of figs</a>, and the Sages said that two sisters were not betrothed.

It was understood that the groom would reciprocate when his groomsmen celebrated their own weddings.<br />
<br />
If some of the brothers performed as groomsmen during their father's lifetime – the father providing the necessary funds to do so - then when the original groom reciprocates with gifts of his own – they are returned to the common estate.<br />

Five things were said about a groomsman's gift: its reciprocation is enforceable in court, it is returned only at the time of marriage, it does not involve any question of interest, the seventh year does not cancel it, and the firstborn does not take a double portion of it.<br />

Bava Batra 146 – Is Talmud Study Hard?

"<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/15-15.htm">But he of good heart has a continuous feast</a>" – this is the Mishnaist, who just learns the rulings themselves – so says Rabbi Zeira. But Rava says the opposite - since the Mishnaist experiences greater frustration, not being able to rule on practical questions of law.<br />
<br />
If a seriously ill person signed away all property to others but retained a little land for himself, his gift to others stands even if he should recover from his illness. Since he retained some land, he did not really expect to die, and his gift is a regular gift. However, if he gave away everything, this indicates that his gift was conditional upon him actually dying, and if he recovers, the gift does not stand.<br />

This is Rabbi Shimon Ben Menasya's opinion, as seen below.<br />
<br />
One whose son had gone abroad and he heard that his son died, and who wrote over all his possessions to others – and then his son came back – his gift is nevertheless valid, the assessment of his mind being irrelevant. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says, "His gift is not valid, because if he would have known that his son was alive, who would not have made the gift."<br />
<br />
All agree that if he said "I was under impression that I had a son, but now I discovered that I don't have a son, and my possessions shall go to so-and-so" - and then it was discovered that his son is alive - that his gift is not valid.<br />

</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If a seriously ill person announced that all of his possessions should go to a particular person but then changed his mind, saying that some possessions should go to someone else, what is the law? Has the ill person retracted his entire gift to the first person, or has he retracted only the part he explicitly willed to someone else?<br />
<br />If it counts as complete retraction, the first person receives nothing, whether the sick person dies or recovers, and the second person receives his share: if the sick person recovers, as a gift, and if he dies, as an inheritance.<br />
<br />
However, if it is a partial retraction, then if the sick person dies, the two receive their shares, but if he recovers, both receive nothing - as in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-146-is-talmud-study-hard.html">the case of a sick person who leaves something over</a>. <br />

The law follows the first possibility.<br />

Do we say that whenever the Temple Estate is involved, the person is likely to grant possession with complete resolve, and thus, the bequest stands? Or does he value his own interests more, and the gift is revocable if he recovers?<br />
<br />
If you say that the gift to the Temple stands if he recovers, what if he declares all his belongings ownerless? Both the rich and the poor can avail themselves of his possessions, so his act is somewhat meritorious - does it stand if he recovers?<br />
<br />
If you say that in the above case, the merit is not enough and he does not resolve to give completely, what if he distributes all only to the poor? Is there a complete resolve?<br />
<br />
All these questions remain unanswered.<br />

* If a man gives everything to his wife, he has only appointed her an administrator over his estate;<br />* A woman who sequesters her possessions by giving them to a third party when she gets married to keep them out of her husband's reach – if she gives all, she can get them back.

Whenever her health worsened, she would transfer the orchard to him as a sickbed gift, and when she recovered, she would retract the gift.<br />
<br />
Once, she felt weak and sent a message to him, "Come, acquire the orchard from me," but Rav Dimi did not come. She sent a message: "Come, acquire it in any way you wish." Rav Dimi did go and asked her to give him only a portion and perform a formal act of acquisition, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-146-is-talmud-study-hard.html">hoping to make the gift irreversible</a>. She did all that, then recovered and reneged on the gift, but Rav Dimi did not want to return it.<br />
<br />
She went to Rav Nachman, who ruled that since she said, "Woe, I am dying!" she made the gift only under the impression that she was dying and thus may still retract.<br />

What happens if he also performed a symbolic acquisition and wrote about it in his will?<br />
<br />
Rav says that he is “riding on two steeds,” giving his will both the power of a sickbed bequest and the gift of a healthy person. Shmuel, however, says that he may have intended the acquisition to take effect after his death, and gifts cannot be given after death.<br />
<br />
Here are the rules then:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
* A formal acquisition done without explanation invalidates the will;<br />
* A formal acquisition, explained to reinforce the bequest, makes the recipient feel good but is retractable upon the ill person's recovery;<br />
* A written will, delivered to the recipient, together with a formal acquisition, makes it irrevocable.<br />

<br />
Someone wrote a gift document but did not record that he was seriously ill or healthy, and then a dispute arose about the validity of the gift. The donor said, "I was sick when I wrote the document, and I have since recovered; hence, my recovery nullifies the gift," but the recipients said, "You were healthy, and the gift is therefore valid."<br />
<br />
The giver must bring proof that he was seriously ill – these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages say that since recipients wish to collect from the giver, who is presently in possession of the property, they are the ones who must prove their claim.<br />

The Sages, therefore, instituted that one can not sell land inherited from a father until one is twenty. In addition, to make a sale, one needs to be physically mature. This usually happens at 12 for girls and 13 for boys, but may come later.<br />
<br />
One person in Bnei Brak sold land he inherited from his father and later died. The members of the father's family challenged the sale, saying that the seller had been a minor at the time of his death. Everyone admitted he was twenty, but the family claimed he did not have two pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva told them, "Firstly, you are not permitted to defile him through an examination. Secondly, it won't help since signs of maturity change after death."<br />

Instead, he must gift his possessions in a regular way, that is, with money, a document, or an act of ownership for land, and with pulling to oneself for movables – this is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Elazar disputes the principle discussed on the previous twenty pages that a seriously ill person can effect the transfer of his property.<br />
<br />Rabbi Eliezer says that if a seriously ill person gave his possessions away orally on Sabbath, his words are upheld since, on Sabbath, he may not write. Rabbi Eliezer is a third opinion. Rabbi Yehoshua says that if he can distribute his possessions orally on Sabbath, then all the more so he can do it on weekdays. Rabbi Yehoshua agrees with the previous twenty pages.<br />

The son's creditors claim that perhaps his father died first. Then, the inheritance passed to the son before he died, and they could collect. The father's inheritors claim that perhaps the son died first. Thus, when the father died, they inherited his property directly, leaving nothing for the son's creditors. <br />
<br />
Beit Shammai&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">says that the father's heirs and the son's creditors divide the money, but Beit Hillel says that the property remains in the possession of the father's heirs.&nbsp;<a href="#" target="_blank">We can understand Beit Hillel's reasoning</a></span>, but what is Beit Shammai's reasoning? They say that a loan document is considered as if it has already been collected, which bolsters the creditors' claim.<br />

Since it is not known who died first, the son's paternal brothers claim that perhaps the mother died first, the son inherited her, and they should inherit him. The mother's relatives (for example, her paternal brothers) claim that perhaps the son died first, so he never inherited anything, so they inherit the estate. <br />
<br />
Unlike in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-157-inheritance-who-died.html">case of a father and son</a>, here the claims of both sides are equally based on "perhaps," and therefore, both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that they divide it.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva says that Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai also argue in this case, but Ben Azzai said to Rabbi Akiva, "We are in enough pain over <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-157-inheritance-who-died.html">what they disagree</a>, and now you come to dispute a unanimous decision?"<br />

<br />
Now, what is hard to understand here? The son stood to inherit his father.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">He sold some properties that would be coming to him in the future. Later, he died and thus never inherited those properties. Now, his son (a grandson) can tell the buyers, "My father sold you property that he stood to inherit but never inherited, so the sale is void. I inherit it not from my father but directly from my grandfather." In this case, the rule that the grandson inherits directly from the grandfather is derived from the following: "<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/45-16.htm">In place of your fathers shall be your sons</a>..."<br />
<br />
So what is difficult? That "<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/45-16.htm">In place of your fathers</a>..." refers to blessings, not monetary laws.<br />

<br />
Folded or “bound” document is written in the following manner. The scribe writes the first line and leaves the second line blank. He then folds the written line forward onto the blank blank and sows (“binds”) the fold shut. He then repeats this process for subsequent lines.<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2ekoSlKayi6IT8ymxcYY-eRQ178CLIwKH0gK4N89dbkMtxUlSGtr2QBTxfbH5khYh3oaqUzJvAauDGxKgS3JMtgNoMUiTnFu3h8SxxhnS8NUoPZvgcM9uttdeeBN7T13Det03jXeCsqY/s1600-h/bound+document+%28artscroll%29.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2ekoSlKayi6IT8ymxcYY-eRQ178CLIwKH0gK4N89dbkMtxUlSGtr2QBTxfbH5khYh3oaqUzJvAauDGxKgS3JMtgNoMUiTnFu3h8SxxhnS8NUoPZvgcM9uttdeeBN7T13Det03jXeCsqY/s200/bound+document+%28artscroll%29.jpg" width="200" /></a><br />
The Sages created the “bound” document, which was very hard to produce, to prevent Kohanim from rashly divorcing their wives. A Kohen cannot remarry his wife because she has become a divorcee. Now that he is first required to find a scribe who knows how to produce a “bound” Get, he will make peace with her. Commercial documents can also be “bound.” Not widely used even in the time of the Mishna, the “bound” document went entirely out of use by the 10th century.<br />

<br />
In contrast, a "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-160-document-that-is-folded.html">bound" document</a> requires that the witnesses sign between each fold. However, this opens a possibility of forgery.<br />
<br />
Should we be concerned that, having the witnesses already signed above, he will write an additional clause at the end of the document that benefits him? - No, because the words "firm and established" are written at the end of a bound document. <br />
<br />
What if he erases the words "firm and established," adds to the document, and then writes the words "firm and established" again? -&nbsp; Additions do not invalidate the document, but erasures, even certified with "firm and established", do invalidate it.<br />

There is, therefore, a concern that an unscrupulous individual might insert a bogus line of text into this space. To protect against this possibility, the Sages decreed that nothing is to be learned from the last line of a document, and any new information there is to be ignored. Therefore, the scribe uses the last line to restate the document's essential elements superfluously.<br />
<br />
If the witnesses leave a space of two lines, the document becomes invalid. However, if they fill the space with the signatures of witnesses who are either relatives or otherwise ineligible to be witnesses, such as gamblers, the document is valid. This is similar to the fact that a hole of three hand-breadths in the covering of a sukkah invalidates it, but a patch of covering made of unfit material can be up to four amot.<br />

Rav said that a certified document with both its text and the signatures of its witnesses written on erased parchment is valid, if it can be discerned that it was erased only once. But maybe he erased the document and the signatures, wrote a new document, forged the signatures, and re-used the certification? Rav answers that such a document is certified not from the certification written in it but from the signatures; thus, the forger gains nothing.<br />

<br />
Rebbi offered a rebuttal: the dating system on the two types of documents is different. Jews dated their documents by the year of the rule of the current monarch. Governments used to add a year to the number of years of the current king to proclaim that  a relatively new monarch was already established. The Sages, desiring to make a bound document very complex, also added a year for bound documents but not for regular ones. One could unbind the document, effectively changing the loan date, receive the payment, pretend to have lost the loan document, offer a receipt, and then collect the second time.<br />
<br />However, according to Rabbi Chanina, a receipt is never used.<br />

Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai also subscribes to the "by way of example" idea, as in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-49-betrothal-with-wrong.html">the case of a woman who appointed an agent to accept her betrothal money of a silver dinar, but the agent accepted a gold dinar</a>. She mentioned the silver dinar only by way of example, and she is betrothed with a golden dinar.<br />

<br />
If the amount becomes erased, such as "... selas," a minimum of 2 is assumed.<br />
<br />
The amount of the loan is mentioned in the upper portion of the document and then again at the end of the document, as in "I have accepted upon myself and upon my heirs a lien for the aforementioned sum of X zuzim," - so that if a letter is missing from the statement in the lower portion, it can be learned from the upper one.<br />

For example, a loan document can be written only with the borrower's authorization. An exception is a Get, a bill of divorce.<br />
<br />
A scribe may write a Get for a man even if his wife is not with him. In the eleventh century, Rabbeinu Gershom instituted a ban against divorcing one's wife against her will. He may also write a receipt for a woman, stating that she received her Ketubah, even if her husband is not with her, and the husband pays the fee.<br />
<br />
A loan document may be written for the borrower even if the lender is not with him, but not for the lender unless the borrower is with him and the borrower pays the fee.<br />

The borrower and lender did not want to go through the trouble of writing a receipt. By right, the lender should keep the loan document, but the borrower feared that the lender would dishonestly collect the entire loan again. Therefore, they deposited the loan document with a third party.<br />
<br />
The lender then told the third party, "If I don't pay the balance by such-and-such date, give the document to the lender." This meant that he forfeited the partial payment. In the end, he did not pay. Rabbi Yossi says that the third party should give the loan document to the lender. Rabbi Yehudah says that he should not give it back because the borrower never really meant it.<br />
<br />
After much deliberation, the law is not like Rabbi Yossi – promises like this one are not binding.<br />

If the debtor cannot pay, the court tears up the loan document and provides the lender with a <i>collection warrant</i>. The lender searches for assets belonging to the borrower, and when he finds those subject to his lien, he takes the collection warrant to court in that locale. The court tears up the collection warrant and issues a <i>repossession warrant</i>. When the lender takes possession of the property, the court tears up the repossession warrant and writes a <i>certificate of appraisal</i>, which is used when the borrower later pays the amount and reclaims his field.<br />
<br />
If someone claims that he lost a deed of sale, they write a replacement for him but omit the repossession guarantee to prevent the possibility of him later collecting twice, breaking the sequence outlined above.<br />

Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says that he is judged based on chazakah. What is the reason behind their argument?<br />
<br />
Rav Dimi says that the deed was in the name of a third party, and the argument is whether the deed transfer also transfers property. Abaye says that invalid witnesses signed, and the argument is about which witnesses accomplish the transfer – those who sign or those who see it. R’ Avina (Ravina) says that they argue whether one who made a superfluous claim is now required to corroborate it, with Rebbi saying “no” and Rabbi Shimon saying “yes.”<br />

<br />
Rabbi Yehudah says they should write a new loan document for the remainder of the debt, but the borrower should not be forced to guard the receipt. Rabbi Yossi says they should write a receipt, and the borrower should guard it since people pay more significant debts faster and since "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/22-7.htm">a borrower is a servant to the lender</a>."

The rich brother can say to him, "Buy slaves so that they should use the bathhouse; buy olives and press them."<br />
<br />
If there were two men in the same town, and their names were Yosef ben Shimon, they could not produce a loan document for collection against each other because each could claim that he was the lender, and nobody could collect from one of them.

If two loan documents were from a single borrower, the larger one is considered paid.<br />
<br />
One who lends money to his fellow based on a guarantor may not collect first from the guarantor. However, if the lender said to the guarantor at the time of the loan, "I am making this loan on the condition that I should be able to collect from whomever I wish," - then he may indeed collect from the guarantor. <br />

The document's existence, together with the witnesses, makes the loan public knowledge. Thus, potential buyers can investigate and find out about the lien created by this loan. Therefore, they accept the risk. Should the borrower default on the loan later, the lender can collect the land from these buyers. Even if the document does not mention the lien, it is assumed to be the omission made by the scribe, and the lien is still presumed.<br />
<br />
However, suppose the loan is taken out before the witnesses but not recorded in a document. In that case, the creditor can collect only from unencumbered properties, that is, fields that are still in the borrower's possession.<br />

In that case, the lender can collect only from the guarantor's unencumbered properties but not from properties that the guarantor has since sold to others. Since the guarantee is not attested to by witnesses, it has no more power than an oral obligation. <br />
<br />
Ben Nannas, however, says that in this case, the lender cannot collect from the guarantor at all. Said Rabbi Ishmael to him, "Why?" Explains Ben Nannas: If a creditor was strangling someone in the street, and this fellow encountered them and said to the creditor, "Leave him be, and I will give you the money that he owes," - the guarantor is not liable because the lender did not lend the money trusting the guarantor in the first place.<br />
<br />
Said Rabbi Ishmael, "One who wishes to become wise should occupy himself with the study of monetary law," for no other branch of Torah law provides the human intellect with as wide-ranging a field of study for reasoning and analysis. Continued Rabbi Ishmael, "And one who wishes to occupy himself with the study of monetary law should serve Shimon ben Nannas." Nevertheless, the law follows Rabbi Ishmael.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">When one observes a certain distance between his potentially damaging objects and his neighbor's wall or pit, does he have to do it only when the wall or pit is already there, or is it true even before the wall is built or the pit is dug out? Abaye says, "Only when it's there." Rava says, "Even before it's there."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Question against Rava from a previous ruling: <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_batra/bava_batra17.html" target="_blank">Olive press refuse... must be distanced three hand-breadths from a neighbor's wall</a>, which implies that the wall must be there! Rava answers: "No, this is true even before the wall is there, and this ruling is still needed to teach us that these materials are harmful to a wall."

<span style="font-size: medium;"></span><span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbah bar bar Chanah said: "A person is permitted to urinate at the side of his fellow's wall." It is thus written, "<a href="http://bible.cc/1_kings/21-21.htm">in the house of Achav everyone who urinates against a wall</a>," meaning every male, which implies that this is a usual practice.<br />
<br />
But we have learned a rule that a person may not pour water or urine at the side of his fellow's wall closer than three hand-breadths from the wall! Answers Rabbah: pouring from a pot is not allowed, but urinating is. <br />
<br />
But another rule states that a person may not urinate next to his fellow's brick wall closer than 3 hand-breadths and 1 hand-breadth from a stone wall! Rabbah is disproved. But he quoted a verse! The verse is saying that Achav will not even have dogs.<br />

Thus, the Rabbi required that fences and walls be built between neighboring properties to prevent such violations. Private places, such as a person's home, where intimate acts are constantly performed, are clearly protected by the law of privacy. A courtyard, however, is considered a semi-private place.<br /><br />Partners who agreed to make a partition in a courtyard they own jointly must build a wall in the center of the courtyard, each providing half of the land upon which to build. This is true, however, only if they agreed to a partition. Since courtyards are semi-private, one cannot force the other  to do so since visual trespass in this situation is not actionable.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Night Winder by Edward Hopper</span></div>

<span style="font-size: medium;">A wall can separate from a ritual impurity of a corpse lying on the other side, but if there is an opening more than a hand-breadth, the impurity goes through. If, however, some object is put into the opening, making it smaller, the wall again separates from impurity. These objects can be growing grass, small scraps of fabric, flesh dangling from an animal, a bird, an idolater, salt, or a Torah scroll. But <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_batra/bava_batra17.html" target="_blank">one is not allowed to plant grass near the wall</a>! - its root is far from the wall.<br />

One must distance a flax pool from vegetables and mustard seeds from his neighbor's bees. Water from soaking flax is toxic to the vegetables. Bees digest mustard, and it causes the honey to become pungent. Alternatively, it causes the bees to consume the honey.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yosi allows damaging agents to be put on one's property when the damage is indirect, like in the case of flax and mustard, putting on the damaged party the obligation to protect itself, and his view becomes law.<br />

This one discusses a field with plants but without a pit.<br />
<br />
One must not plant a tree near his neighbor's field unless he distances the tree four amot (6 feet) from his neighbor's boundary. This distance is needed to provide sufficient space for cultivating his planting without encroachment on his neighbor's property. If there is a fence, no distance is required.<br />
<br />
If the tree roots extend into the neighbor's property, the neighbor may excavate three hand-breadths deep and remove the roots to facilitate his plowing. If the neighbor was digging a pit and came upon roots, he may cut downwards to whatever depth he finds necessary.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">Ulla said: "A tree within sixteen amot (~30 feet) of a boundary is a 'thief' because it draws nutrients illegally from a neighboring field." One does not bring first fruit from it&nbsp; – because it should be "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">from your field</a>..." and because stolen produce is unfit for Temple service.</span><br />
<br /><span style="font-size: medium;">A question against Ulla: Rabbi Akiva said, "Even a minute measure of land is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/02/discovery-how-i-was-cause-of-my-own.html">subject to the requirements</a> of first fruit, and it is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/08/daf-in-100-words-gittin-36.html">fit to write prosbul on its account</a>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Ulla answers: "Rabbi Akiva is talking about wheat, not a tree." Only wheat can grow on a minute measure of land.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">However, one of Yehoshua's conditions when dividing Israel was that the practice of planting trees near the border should be tolerated by neighbors, thus making the first fruit fit.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Apples, Hat, and Trees by Levi Wells Prentice</span></div>

In other words, it is logical to presume that the one who currently holds the object in his possession is the rightful owner. <br />
<br />
In the case of real property, physical "possession" of it is impossible. Current occupancy is also inconclusive since preventing people from ever entering one's property is impossible. Instead, presumptive ownership is assigned to the last person known to have held the property. Thus, when that person claims that the current occupant is an illegal squatter, the burden of proof is on the occupant. If, however, the current resident established a "chazakah," usually by continuous uncontested occupancy for three years, the burden of proof is shifted to the previous owner.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">Presumptive ownership of houses, ditches, and bathhouses - or any other property that yields benefits continually - is established after three years of uncontested occupancy from day to day. For other properties, it depends on their everyday use; for example, presumptive ownership for a field is established after harvesting three crops.<br />
</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
Why three years? For three years after purchasing a property, a person is careful with his deed but longer than that, he is only careful to keep his deed if his property occupancy has been challenged. Therefore, after three years of the unchallenged use of a property, we do not insist that the occupant produce documentary proof of his ownership; instead, we rely on his very occupancy as proof.<br />

Once they agreed to divide the yard, even though they did not stipulate to build the wall, they must make a stone wall against the objections of either party. This is true even if they have not agreed to divide since any one of them can separate at will. However, the previous ruling  deals with a tiny yard of less than 8 by 4 amot (about 16 by 8 feet), which is only divisible if they agree to divide it.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Landscape with Crumbling Wall by Caspar David Friedrich</span></div>

One said, "It was the land of my forefathers," and produced witnesses. The other one produced witnesses that he used the land for three years needed to establish presumptive ownership (chazakah.)<br />
<br />
Rabbah said, "Why should he lie?" The current occupant could have kept the land, claiming that he bought it, so we should believe him when he says that he inherited it. But Abaye said, "Why should he lie?" can't be used to contradict witnesses.<br />
<br />
The current occupant then changed his claim, saying, "Yes, the land indeed belonged to your forefathers, but I bought it from them, and I feel as secure as if it were my forefathers" - this claim was accepted.<br />
<br />
The general rule is that one cannot enter a claim that contradicts his previous claim entirely, but he can add information or amend the previous claim by reinterpreting it.<br />

"Had I returned the land, I would be able to collect the second loan only with an oath, and it is proper to <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">avoid even truthful oaths</a>.

Rabbi Ami considered the case:<br />
<br />
* Should he be required to pay? But there aren't two witnesses!<br />
* Exempt him based on "Why would he lie?" –&nbsp; he could deny having snatched it altogether? This argument is weakened by the witness.<br />
* Make him swear that he did not snatch it? But he himself admits that he did!<br />

Rav Ashi said, "I asked all the great scholars of the generation, and they said that plowing establishes chazakah." Rav Nachman bar Yitzhak answered, "Is it proper to rule based on a poll? Others don't think this way." And the final decision is that plowing does not establish chazakah.<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOW8Eulg8pfpo30_ZV3ES6bkDyrPLMTOUJb1ZM3cO_iMzDx4bH-khwOui1QNLqic8lv7QwNzBg3PT1ar88DnCFhO0MeHy6Wlkcr-ri_2LOlntvRKhgnUQZSuiSzNIc0N1yfQieuHV1JVoJ/s1600-h/Camille+Pissarro+-+Les+chataigniers+a+Osny+-+The+Chestnut+Trees+at+Osny+-+1873.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOW8Eulg8pfpo30_ZV3ES6bkDyrPLMTOUJb1ZM3cO_iMzDx4bH-khwOui1QNLqic8lv7QwNzBg3PT1ar88DnCFhO0MeHy6Wlkcr-ri_2LOlntvRKhgnUQZSuiSzNIc0N1yfQieuHV1JVoJ/s320/Camille+Pissarro+-+Les+chataigniers+a+Osny+-+The+Chestnut+Trees+at+Osny+-+1873.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one sells his land and retains the trees for himself, he keeps a certain amount of land around the trees. So, if his trees die, he is entitled to plant others. <br />
<br />
Does this not contradict Rabbi Akiva's ruling that a seller sells generously, which we have learned from the following: when one sells a house or a field, but not a well located in its midst, then <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_batra/bava_batra64.html" target="_blank">Rabbi Akiva says that he sells the entire house, leaving himself no right-of-way in it at all</a>?<br />
<br />
In fact, even Rabbi Akiva would agree to the ruling about trees. The tree weakens the surrounding soil, and the seller worries that if the tree dies, the buyer may tell him, "Uproot your tree and be gone!" Thus, the seller reserves land around the trees for himself.<br />

If the owner protests at least once in three years, the occupant is put on notice, and his chazakah is ineffective. In other words, if the occupant really bought the field, he should keep the deed, and his negligence to do so in inexcusable in the face of a protest, thus his three years of occupancy don't help.<br />
<br />
It is sufficient to protest in front of two witnesses without the occupant present. These witnesses have friends, their friends have friends, and the word travels till it reaches the occupant. If, however, the owner is in a province that has little communication with the province where his field is, he will not bother to protest since his protest can't reach the occupant anyway, and thus, the chazakah can't be established at all. Examples of such regions are Judea and Galilee, which at the time had little travel between them.<br />

Bava Batra 39 – How to Lodge an Effective Protest and Confidentiality Agreements (Civil)

If, however, he says, "So-and-so is a thief, for he has taken possession of my land through an act of theft, and tomorrow I shall claim it from him in court," this is an effective protest. The threat to sue is unnecessary, but this is how people usually conclude their protest.<br />
<br />
If the protester tells the witnesses, "Don't tell the occupant that I lodged a protest," we assume that he means not to say to him directly, but they may tell others. Thus, this protest is effective. If the witnesses promise on their own, "Not a word of protest will leave our mouths," there is still a chance that they will reveal it inadvertently. Only if they are told, "Keep this completely confidential," can they be relied upon to keep it secret.<br />

<br />
One woman told a man, "I will marry you only if you give me all your property." His son wanted a share. The man then told witnesses, "First, hide yourself and write a gift of all my property to my son." Both gifts were annulled: to the woman – because it was given under duress, to the son – because it was only for subterfuge.<br />

<br />
If, however, the occupant replied, "You sold this land to me," "You gave it to me as a gift," "Your father sold it to me," or "Your father gave it to me as a gift," - it is a meaningful chazakah, and the occupant keeps the property.

In that case, they combine to establish a chazakah against the original owner, provided their purchases were recorded in deeds. The original owner can't claim that the quick succession of owners was proof of their illegitimate occupancy without him needing to protest. Instead, the public knowledge of their sales should have caused his protest.<br />
<br />
Some people have legitimate access to other people's property, so they can never establish chazakah, even if they have the movables in their possession or if they occupy the real property. Thus, craftsmen, sharecroppers, and property administrators cannot establish a chazakah. Similarly, a husband cannot establish a chazakah on his wife's property, nor can a wife establish a chazakah on her husband's property, a father on his son's property, or a son on his father's property.<br />

<br />
Because of that, the seller of a field cannot testify on behalf of the buyer. If someone can prove that the seller never owned the field and he is, in fact, a thief, then that field is not a guarantee for the seller's loans, and the seller becomes a "bad person who borrows and does not repay" - a situation that people try to avoid.<br />

Said Rabbah, "This is only true when the original owner gave the craftsman the article in the presence of witnesses. But if not, the craftsman could have denied receiving the article altogether and is believed on the strength of the "Why would he lie?" argument.<br />

Said Abaye, "If so, he should be believed even if there were witnesses, for had he wanted to lie, he could have said that he returned the article."<br />

<br />
If there is unharvested fruit in the field, he cannot testify. The sharecropper has a material interest because if someone else proves to be the actual owner of the field, the sharecropper will not collect his full share of the unharvested fruit.<br />
<br />
However, he can testify if there is no fruit in the field. Though advancing his employer's cause might protect his job as a sharecropper in this field, he knows that many other sharecropping jobs are available to him. Moreover, he knows that his employer is not obligated to continue to employ him. Therefore, his interest in the outcome of the case is negligible.<br />

<br />
What is the reason?<br />
<br />
* Is it because any sale is forced since the seller needs money? - No, it could be different when it is against his will.<br />
* Is it because a recalcitrant husband forced to give a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29">Get</a> is indeed divorced? - This is not valid proof because it is a mitzvah to heed the directive of the Sages.<br />
<br />
Rather, it is derived from the following ruling: if they subjected a </span><span style="font-size: medium;">woman</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> to distress until she agreed to be married, the marriage is valid.

Said Rav Huna: both documents have legal force. But how can it be? Instead, Rav Huna meant that the forced sale would be valid if not canceled by the prior notification – since it was Rav Huna who introduced <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-48-is-forced-action-valid.html">the forced sale rule</a>.<br />

If someone occupies her property for three years without her protest, she can say that she expected her husband to protest, so her absence of protest is of no consequence. She does not have to protest her husband's use of her land either. However, if her husband ruins her field with ditches, she has to protest; otherwise, her absence of protest will be interpreted as an admission that he had bought the land.<br />
<br />As a rule, however, one can't establish the right to damaging behavior. For example, if one installs a kiln that emits heavy smoke, he cannot claim to have established a chazakah. The neighbor can protest and block this after any time period. The same applies to an outhouse if its odor disturbs the neighbor.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Woman With A Dove by Cecco del Caravaggio</span></div>

However, the sale is final if she buys it with money he had known from before.<br />
<br />
The best way to sell the field to one's wife is to write both terms in the contract, "the field is sold to you" and "the field is given to you." The sale term will help her if the field is repossessed by the husband's lenders – by giving her the right to be reimbursed by the husband. The term "given" will help against a neighbor's&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/08/immediate-neighbor-of-property-has.html">right to buy an adjoining field</a>. <br />

For example, a case where a seller, that is, the previous owner, claims "I did not sell the land," and the purchaser, that is, the occupant, claims, "purchased it" - this is the chazakah of proving title, which requires three years to take effect.<br />
<br />
But regarding a chazakah against which there is no challenge, for example, one who gives a gift, or two brothers who divide an estate – where the purpose of chazakah is merely to acquire the property in question – if one locked, fenced, or breached the property even to a minor extent – this is considered chazakah.<br />

But where the seller is present, he does not have to say anything, and his silence alone indicates his acquiescence.<br />
<br />
What is the rule for a gift?<br />
<br />
Rav says that the giver gives the gift generously out of fondness for the recipient, so no further instruction is necessary, and the chazakah can be performed in his absence. Shmuel says that since the giver receives no money, his instruction is undoubtedly required. Actually, Shmuel agrees that the gift is given generously.

<br />
<i><b>The rule</b></i><br />
<br />
A convert is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/04/bava-kamma-110.html">like a new-born child</a>: he has severed connection with his old family, and if he has not created a new one yet, he has no inheritors. One who spreads out mats on the ownerless land of a deceased convert and lies down upon them has acquired the land.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Proof</b></i><br />
<br />
One can acquire a Canaanite slave using a propriety act, such as having the slave put on a shoe for him, remove his shoe, or lift him. We see that supporting the weight is a propriety act – and so it is with the land: spreading the mats and lying down on it constitutes a proprietary act. <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/10/kiddushin-23-can-canaanite-slave-woman.html" target="_blank">Compare this to a slave woman</a>.<br />

Thus, a Jew who takes possession of property according to the provisions of local law is not guilty of theft even if the Torah law would consider the property belonging to another Jew. This applies, however, only to the laws sanctioned by the constitution of the country but not when monarchy appropriates property by force.<br />

Ordinarily, when two pairs of witnesses offer conflicting testimony, the result is a stalemate; the court does not know which pair to believe. However, when the second pair impugns the first pair's ability to have witnessed the event altogether, the second pair is believed, and the first witnesses are designated false (plotters). Whatever penalty they sought to impose against their victim is assessed against them.<br />
<br />
In our case, they sought to deprive the original owner of the field by falsely testifying that the occupant had established a chazakah. Accordingly, they must pay the field's value to the owner, who receives these punitive damages in addition to the field itself, which he retrieves from the occupant.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Workers Talking Politics by Hermann Kauffmann<br />

But if the user made a partition for his animals ten hand-breadths high, or he erected such a partition for an oven, stove or millstone; if he brought his chicken into the owner's house, or if he made for his manure in the courtyard a place either three hand-breadths deep or three hand-breadths high – this is a chazakah.

Rav Banaah asked, What is Abraham doing?" and Eliezer replied, "He is lying in the arms of Sarah, and she is peering at his head." This symbolizes the true union of Abraham and Sarah, which transcended the physical limitations of their earthly marriage. <br />

Eliezer announced Rav Banaah, and Abraham said, "Let him enter. It is well known that there is no physical desire in this world." Rav Banaah surveyed the dimensions and departed.<br />

Even though he defined the boundaries of the entire building in the deed, it is possible that he intended to sell just one apartment, and he drew the boundaries of the whole building only to utilize known landmarks. Since the seller stated that he was selling a "house" (as opposed to an "apartment building"), the boundaries written in a deed are regarded as imprecise, and the buyer acquires only one apartment.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it is recommended that the seller write some clause such as "I am not retaining anything for myself in this transaction," because with it, the seller relinquishes his possible claim that the boundaries he drew were imprecise.<br />

The clause "rooftop is mine" is redundant. It is already his, as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-60-when-one-buys-house.html">we have learned before</a>. Therefore, this clause is reinterpreted to give him additional rights.<br />

Exactly which rights he gets is subject to a dispute: he may project beams from the roof into the adjacent yard, or he may rebuild it if it collapses, with the second view prevailing.<br />

However, to get to the cistern, the seller has to purchase the right-of-way from the buyer, in the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. According to him, the typical inclination of one who sells something is to transfer it fully and generously without reserving anything for himself. In this case, he also transferred the right of way by not saying anything. The Sages disagree and say that typically, the seller wants to sell no more than he has to, retaining the right to pass through the house to reach the cistern.<br />

Rav Nachman was close to the Exilarch, the Jewish ruler of Babylonia, and observed many judges and court cases, so he knew which view was followed in practice.<br />
<br />
One who sold a house without specifying what was included in the sale has sold the attached mortar, not the movable mortar, nor the movable oven or stove. If the seller said, "I am selling the house and all contained therein," all movable objects are sold – but not the easily movable objects (carried away). Even easily movable objects are sold if one sells a courtyard with everything therein. If one sells a town, even his animals therein are included.<br />

<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says, "Anything attached to the ground is considered the ground. Therefore, he has sold the mortar."<br />
<br />
What would the Sages say regarding food placed on this mortar if the mortar is ritually impure? Is it part of the house and thus part of the ground for ritual laws, even if not for commerce, and then the food is pure, or is the mortar not part of the ground for both selling and ritual, and the food is impure? - This remains unresolved.<br />

One who sells the house of an olive press without specifying what is included in the sale has sold the vat, the crusher (used to pre-soften olives), and the "maidens." These items are automatically sold with the press because they are attached to the building where the press is housed.<br />

<br />
However, if he said, "I am selling you the town and all that is contained therein," then even if there were animals and slaves in the town at the time of the sale, they are sold along with the town.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "He has sold even the <i>santer</i>." What a santer is&nbsp;is a matter of dispute: either a town clerk, a slave owned by the city who kept information on boundaries and ownership of properties, or the fields that immediately surround the city.<br />

He has sold the carob tree that has not been grafted and the virgin sycamore (planetree) that has not been pruned. All these items either serve the field or aren't significant in their own right.<br />

If he said, "I am selling you the field and all that is contained therein," he also sold cut harvest. Even so, he has not sold independent items, such as a pruned sycamore tree and a sturdy watchman's hut.<br />

What is the rule if one records making his deposit in a document, and then the custodian tells him, "I have already returned it to you?" Do we say that if the custodian wished to lie, he could have stated that the deposit suffered an unavoidable mishap, in which case he would have been believed? Therefore, we believe him based on the "why would he lie?" argument?<br />

Or can the depositor ask, "Then why do I have this document in my hands?" "Why would he lie?" is not applicable?<br />

<br />
Rabbi Shimon thinks that one who consecrates is stingy, like a seller, and keeps all he can for himself. Why is then the carob consecrated? He should have kept it, together with the land needed for it!<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon is saying this only for the sake of argument: "I myself say that the trees are not consecrated. You, the Sages, who say that the carob is consecrated, should agree to me that he keeps the pit and the wine press". And the Sages answer: "One consecrates so liberally that even the pit and wine press are included."</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Sycamore, Catskill Clove Below Haines Fall by John Williamson</span></div>

An Arab merchant told me, "Come, I will show you Mount Sinai." I went and saw that scorpions surrounded it, and they resembled white donkeys. I heard a Heavenly voice saying, "Woe to me (God) that I have sworn to exile My people, and now that I have sworn, who can annul the oath for Me?"<br />

When Rabbah returned, the Rabbis told him,&nbsp; - Every Abba (his proper name) is a donkey, and every bar bar Chanah is a fool. You ought to have declared, "It is annulled for You."<br />

And Rabbah, what did he think? That perhaps the Heavenly voice was talking about <a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/8-21.htm">the oath about the Flood</a>. <br />

Rav says, "Once the buyer has pulled the ship even a small distance, he has acquired it." But Shmuel says, "He has not acquired the ship until he pulls it away completely from the place it originally occupied."<br />
<br />
Is this the same disagreement as the two views on acquiring an animal by pulling: (1) the animal is acquired when it raises the front and hind leg, or (2) only when it walks its entire length?<br />
<br />
No, it is not the same! Once the animal starts to move, it will move the other two legs, but the ship may stop after the initial push. On the other hand, once a ship is moved, it moves as a whole, whereas an animal can put its legs back. The two disagreements are different, and both had to be recorded.<br />

If, however, the object is still the seller's until delivery, he will be careful.<br />
<br />
If the ship is on public grounds, one cannot pull it into his domain; therefore, the seller can give control over it to the buyer. If the ship is in an area people can use as their own, the buyer should pull the ship into his domain.

If he does not do so, the buyer acquires only the paper on which it is written for use, such as a bottle stopper. The sale would then become void because of the law against overcharge.<br />
<br />
If one says to his fellow, "Sell me this yoke for 200 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuz_%28Jewish_coin%29">zuz</a>," then it is evident that the yoke alone is not sold for this amount, and thus, the oxen are included. But the Sages say," The purchase price is no proof." It may be viewed as a gratuity that the buyer gives to the seller or an overpayment, in which case the sale would be voidable.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Oxen Pulling a Cart by Rosa Bonheur&nbsp;<br />

However, Nachum the Mede says he has sold his gear, too. <br />
<br />
All agree that the saddle, blanket, girth under the donkey's belly, and breast strap are sold. These are necessary for the use of the donkey. The argument is about the sack and saddlebag, specifically cargo gear. The first teacher holds that ordinarily, a donkey is used for riding, and the cargo gear is not included in the sale. Nachum holds that ordinarily, a donkey is used for transporting cargo; therefore, its cargo gear is included in the sale.<br />
<br />
Is the argument about the gear that is on the donkey or the gear that is not? This question remains unresolved, and the one who wants to extract money from his fellow needs to prove his right.<br />

Why is a donkey different from a cow? In this case, he said, "I am selling you a nursing donkey." For the cow, this may be interpreted as buying the cow for its milk, but the non-kosher milk of a donkey is useless to the buyer, and therefore the "nursing" adds its foal to the sale.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: A Spring Day, or Beehives by Sergey Ivanovich Svetoslavsky</span></div>

Thus, if a tree dies, the buyer takes the dead wood, but he may not plant a tree on that site. Rabbi Meir, however, says that he has acquired land.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if the branches of the trees grow until they extend over the seller's land, the seller may not trim them, even if they block sunlight and thus damage his crops. Since the buyer gets no land, it is understood that the seller pledges his own land to provide for the tree's needs.<br />
<br />
If someone purchases three trees, he has acquired land since he surely intended to buy a field of trees. Therefore, if the branches grow over the seller's land, the seller may trim them.<br />

<br />
Similarly, if he sold him inferior wheat, and it was found to be superior, the seller can retract.<br />
<br />
The "red" wheat is reddened by the sun, and it produces more flour, while the "white" wheat yields superior bread.

However, this is only true for items that are generally not lifted. Items that are usually lifted can't be acquired by pulling at all.<br />
<br />
But is that true? Consider the following case: one who steals a bag of money on Shabbat by pulling it out of the house is not liable to pay since he is liable with his life for carrying on Shabbat. We see that he acquires the bag by pulling it, even though usually, money bags are lifted! <br />
<br />
Rebuttal: You know what we are dealing with here? A bag that's too big to be lifted. Therefore, the rule stands, and pulling is usually ineffective as a method of acquisition if lifting is possible.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Pulling a Dory by Winslow Homer</span></div>

But how can this ruling be true? If the container belongs to the seller, he owns the merchandise until the buyer takes delivery. And if it belongs to the buyer, he acquires every measure as it is poured in. The answer is that the container belongs to a middleman, who loans it to the seller while filling it, then loans it to the buyer after it's full.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Still Life - Post, Bottle, Cup, and Fruit by Paul Cezanne</span></div>

This law applies to measures used for liquids that leave a residue, such as wine or oil. Since the residue tends to settle in the measure and congeal, the measure must be cleaned periodically. Since a wholesaler sells frequently, his measure tends to gather residue more quickly.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the opposite is true. Since the wholesaler uses the measure more frequently, the residue that gathers in it does not congeal between uses. Therefore, the wholesaler must wipe his measures once every twelve months and a householder – once every thirty days.<br />
<br />
The phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-15.htm">A perfect and just weight you shall have</a>...” also teaches that the seller must act justly and give the buyer a little extra.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: An Old Man Weighing Gold by Quiringh Gerritsz van Brekelenkam<br />

Rabbi Shimon says that this is permitted only when one can't find wheat at all, but if wheat is available, even at very high prices, one should stay, provided that he can afford to feed his family.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai also used to say that Elimelech (the husband of Naomi in the book of Ruth) and his two sons were the most extraordinary men of their generation and the caretakers of their generation, and for what reason did they die? For moving out of the Land of Israel during famine, even though wheat was available to them.<br />

<br />
Normally, the law follows the principle of majority, assuming that the situation at hand is typical of the majority of such cases. However, in money matters, there is another principle: “To extract money from his fellow, the burden of proof lies with the claimant,” which&nbsp;trumps the principle of majority. Since the buyer cannot definitely prove his claim, the seller does not have to refund the purchase amount.<br />

All these are general guidelines without a prevailing local custom; however, if there is an accepted custom, it is binding.<br />

If the buyer suspects that the grain contains more impurities than 1/24 and begins to sift it, and it is found that it contains more than the allowed 1/24, he may sift all the grain and return ALL the impurities to the seller.

But compare it to the following.<br />
<br />
If a seller says, “I am selling you a cellar of wine,” he must give the buyer wine, which is good. If he says, “I am selling you THIS cellar of wine,” meaning AS IS, he may give the buyer quality wine as sold in stores for immediate consumption, that is, souring wine. <br />
<br />
So when does the buyer accept 10% inferior wine? When the seller said “as is,” the buyer mentioned that he needed wine for cooking—which means that it would be used slowly over time. “As is” allows all souring wine, but “for cooking” requires no more than 10%.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: A Woman Drawing Wine From A Barrel by Gabriel Metsu<br />

If one bought a barrel of wine and it spoiled within three days, then Rav says that it was beginning to spoil at the time of the sale, and therefore, it is a mistaken purchase, which can be returned.

Rabbi Ishmael, however, says, "This is nothing but a cattle barn!"<br />
<br />
Incidentally, this ruling teaches that it is not proper for a son-in-law to live in his father-in-law's house. Instead, the groom's father usually built a small annex adjoining his house, where the newlywed couple could live. This accords with the teaching from the book of Ben Sira: "Lighter than bran is the son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law's house. Still lighter is a guest who invites another guest. And lighter yet is one who gives an answer before he has heard the question."<br /><br />

<br />
If he dyed it poorly, the dyer gets the lesser of the improvement to the wool and his expenses. Since he knew that using inferior dye would result in an inferior product, he is a damager. His compensation claim is that he did, in fact, increase the value.<br />
<br />
If he was supposed to dye red, and he dyed black, Rabbi Meir says that he pays the value of wool, but Rabbi Yehudah awards the claim as above.<br />

<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
That is, when the thief returns the dyed wool to the owner, is he returning both the dye and the wool? Or, perhaps, that improvement is not considered material, and thus, he is returning only the wool but not the dye – which has, in effect, disappeared? </div>
<div>

Foodstuff that grew of itself can be collected and eaten, but after the harvest is over, one cannot keep it in his home but should put it out in the street for everybody's consumption. Wood is included in the laws of shmita.<p></p><p>However, Rava noticed a contradiction. A rule about cane reeds and grapevine leaves states that if these are gathered for food, then they have the laws of shmita, but if they are gathered for kindling - they do not have the laws of shmita. He resolved the contradiction: the laws of shmita apply to produce where the benefit and consumption come simultaneously, just like with food.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, wood is burnt (and destroyed) in an oven, but the benefit (baking) comes later. On the other hand, dyestuff is destroyed when dissolved in water, and the benefit - dying the cloth - comes simultaneously. The laws of shmita apply only to stuff that is destroyed simultaneously with giving benefit.</p><p>Art: Harvest Camille Pissaro</p><div><br /></div>

He is really buying the land for himself, but he wants the deed to be written in the name of the Exilarch. He is doing it to discourage protesters to the sale, who might claim that they are the true owners of the land and not the seller.&nbsp;</p><p>The ruling then says we do not force the seller to write another bill of sale with the buyer's name. The seller might not want to write two bills of sale because it may look like he is selling the field twice. However, if the buyer stipulated that he would want two bills of sale, the seller has to produce them. But that is obvious?

There is a presumption that a person is not brazen enough to deny his obligation to the face of the creditor, who did him a favor by loaning money without interest. If he partially admits, that is because he is trying to evade part of the claim until he has money. Therefore, the Torah imposed an oath.</div>

But if one insists and asks his fellow to swear and the fellow accepts an oath, things become more complex.<p></p><p>If witnesses come and testify that the custodian consumed the deposit himself, he is obligated to pay for it double what he stole. If the custodian repents and confesses his false oath, he must pay the total amount, plus one-fifth of the value, and bring a guilt offering to the Temple.</p><p>What if one robs his father and swears to him that he did not do it, the father dies, and the son then repents his false oath? The son pays the principal plus one-fifth to his father's heirs (his brothers and uncles.) If he does not have the money to repay, he can borrow from others and give it to his brothers; his creditors will come and collect from his portion of the inheritance.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Last Moments of Christopher Columbus by Claude Jacquand</p>

If one robs something and feeds it to his children, they are not liable to pay. If he left the item as an inheritance, they must return it. Once the stolen property is no longer extant, they are not liable to return it unless the father also left real estate property – for it is then mortgaged for his theft.<br />

If the owner was aware of the theft but then counted the flock and found it complete, the thief is not liable for any future mishap. But if the owner was unaware of the theft, counting does not help since the thief has taught the lamb to go astray, and the owner needs to know which lamb it was.<br />

Five damage categories are considered unusual and liable for only half-damage: domestic animals who gore, push, bite, squat, and kick.

<br />
Additional support for this ruling comes from "...<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/24-12.htm">through desolation the gate is broken apart</a>," meaning that demons of desolation ruin the house, or alternatively from the reason that the residents see what needs repair and attend to it. What is the practical difference between these two reasons? Using the house for storing wood and straw.<div><br /></div><div>Art: An Interior with a Stove and a View into a Dining Room by Carl Vilhelm Holsoe</div>

Said Rabbi Yochanan, - This ruling only talks about the time right before Shabbat, when running for the sake of Shabbat is allowed, but otherwise the one who runs is liable.<br />
<br />
Suppose one chops wood in the public domain and thereby does damage in the private domain, or chops in the private domain and damages something in the public domain, or chops in private and damages something in the private domain.

Rabbi Oshaya listed thirteen primary damages: unpaid custodian, borrower, paid custodian, renter, bully, pain, healing, unemployment, and humiliation, plus the four primary damagers above.

And "...the owner of the ox shall be innocent (clean)..." teaches that he can't sell it, as people say, "so-and-so has gone out clean of his possessions."<div><br /></div><div>Art: Cook with Food by Frans Snyders</div>

Man is liable for four damage payments but fire for just one. However, the ox disproves that since it is also liable for just one payment.<br />

If someone pushes an ox into a pit or startles the animal and it falls, the owner of the pit is liable for whatever can't be collected from the first man.<br />

If an ox and a person together push either a person or an animal or utensils into a pit, all (the person, the ox, and the pit) are liable for damages.

Ruling: if the finder returned it where the owner will see it, he is not obligated to deal with it further, but if it was stolen or lost, he is responsible. Doesn't it follow that it was stolen or lost from the finder's home, and he is thus a paid custodian? No! It was stolen from the place where he returned it, because he returned it in the afternoon, too late for the owner to see it.</div>

In contrast, the fourfold or fivefold payment law applies only to an ox or sheep.<br />
<span id="formatbar_Buttons" style="display: block;"></span><br />
One who steals after a thief does not pay a twofold payment because twofold payment applies only when “...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">it is stolen from the house of the man</a>...”. Likewise, one who slaughters or sells after a thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.<br />

His source is another Misha: One who steals a stolen item from a thief does not pay the twofold payment. Why not?

The red heifer was slaughtered in a designated place on the Mount of Olives, which faces the portals of the Temple. Rabbi Shimon maintains that even after the red heifer was slaughtered on its pyre, it may be redeemed if a nicer heifer is found.<br />
<br />
Similarly, if the thief slaughtered a stolen blemished offering outside the Temple, he is liable to the fourfold or fivefold payment – since that animal could be redeemed and eaten.<br />

Since the Torah said, "<b>His</b> best land," the quality of the world's lands has nothing to do with it! Still, they challenged his answer, contrasting it with the rule of paying to different categories of people: creditors, damaged parties, and widows <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/ketubot/ketubot89.html" target="_blank">claiming their Ketubah payment</a>.

<br />
* for actual damage;<br />
* for pain;<br />
* for healing;<br />
* for loss of employment;<br />
* and for humiliation.<br />
<br />
How do we assess actual damage? If the assailant blinded the victim's eye, cut off his hand, or broke his leg, we view the victim as if he were a servant being sold in the market, and we appraise how much he was worth before he was wounded and how much he is worth now.<br />

<br />
In the school of Chizkiyah, they taught "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-24.htm">an eye for an eye</a>"&nbsp;and a "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-23.htm">life for a life</a>" and not a life and an eye for an eye. If it enters your mind that the payment for blinding someone is losing an actual eye, it could happen that at the time when the court was blinding the assailant, he died. This means that an eye for an eye refers to a monetary payment.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Barchfeld Money Changer Weighing Coins by Johann Georg Soemmer&nbsp;</div>

If one does take it from them, a spirit of wisdom and piety does not reside in him. <br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
This enactment was promulgated by the court of Rabbi Yehudah The Prince to make it easier to repent for those who want to do it. It applies only to long-term transgressors who can't return all money. Still, they need to try to return the funds to fulfill their Biblical obligation. It is a disagreement whether  this enactment applies nowadays.</div>

If the craftsman acquires the improvements, he, in effect, sells the owner that portion when he returns the finished product, and the money that the owner owes is not considered wages but a loan.<br /><br />The prevailing view, however, is that the craftsman does not acquire the improvements and that the payments owed to him are thus wages. Hence, the prohibition against delaying payments applies to contractual work.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Peasants at the Table, El Almuerzo by Diego Rodrigues De Silva y Velasquez</span></div>

Reuven's creditor comes and attempts to collect the field from Shimon in payment of Reuven's obligation. In that case, the law is that Reuven may go and argue the case with the creditor to prevent him from collecting the field. And the creditor may not tell Reuven, "You have no standing in the matter."<br /><br />But otherwise, anyone who has no standing cannot argue the case in court, and attorney representation is disallowed, and so decides Shulchan Aruch. Other opinions, however, allow power of attorney.<br /><br /><div>Art: Good News by Hubert Salentin</div>

Since the field was never his, the purchase money is considered a loan. The payment for improvement looks like interest, which is forbidden – so says Shmuel.

The garment is already included in "any lost article," so what does it teach? - Just as a garment is unique in that it has identifying marks and claimants (owners), so too, anything that has identifying marks must be announced. However, one is not obligated to return a lost object that the owner has despaired of recovering.&nbsp;</div>

For example, a rooster or calf needs to be fed but can not do anything to earn their keep. They should be sold, and the money should be held for the owner. If an animal works and eats, such as an ox or donkey, it should be put to work for twelve months and sold. One may use that money, so if it is lost, he is responsible.<br />
<br />
If one found books (scrolls), he should read from them once in thirty days to air them out and prevent their decay.<br />

If he did  not desire to swear and paid, and then the thief is found, the thief pays the double amount to the custodian.<br />
<br />
If one rented a cow and then lent it to another, and it subsequently died a natural death, then the renter is not liable for that, but the borrower is liable to pay the renter. Rabbi Yossi says that the renter needs to return the value of the cow to the owner.<br />
