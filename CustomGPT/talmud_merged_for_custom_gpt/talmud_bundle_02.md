<br />
Rabbi Yochanan says that it IS an act of negligence and that the first custodian is now liable even for unavoidable accidents, for which he was not liable before because the owner can say to the first custodian, "You are credible to me with an oath, and that second custodian is not."<br />

One reason is that a person prefers a measure of his own produce - for which he toiled - to nine measures of his fellow's produce, which can be bought. That is an exaggeration, but if it is not spoiling faster than normal, it should not be sold. </div>
<div>

Another explanation is that he may have designated it as tithes for his other produce, and he may come to eat non-tithed produce. Knowing that the produce is not sold, the owner is likelier to do this designation.</div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">When one redeems the second tithe taken from his produce for money, he must add 1/5. In many other cases, 1/5 is added, such as when redeeming property belonging to the Temple treasury or repaying a Kohen's portion (trumah) that one has accidentally eaten.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Is the 1/5 calculated on the principal ("from the inside) or on the principal plus the addition ("from the outside")? </span></div>

<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">For example, adding a 1/5 to 20 can mean paying 4 (1/5 of 20.) It can also mean 5 since the total is 25, and 1/5 is 5.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">The answer is that 1/5 is calculated from the outside and is 1/4 of the principal.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><div>Art: Our Village Clockmaker Solving a Problem by James Campbell</div><div><br /></div></span></div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">"Neshech" means "to bite" because interest "bites" the borrower. Neshech denotes interest prohibited by the Torah. Examples of neshech are lending four coins with the stipulation to be paid back five or lending two measures of wheat and be paid back three.</span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">"Tarbit" means "increase." Tarbit denotes interest prohibited by the Sages. An example of tarbit is a forward contract for produce, where a buyer pays now at current prices for goods to be delivered later. The buyer wants to protect himself from a price increase, and it is allowed if the seller has the goods in stock or if the market price of the goods is stable.</span></div>

The creditor says, "It is mine: it fell from me, and I subsequently found it," but the debtor says, "It was indeed yours. However, I repaid the debt to you," the witnesses who appear on the document must certify that the document is indeed authentic, and they divide it with an oath, just like in the case of a garment.<br /><br />Why is the certification needed if the debtor admits the document is valid? Because if we believe him on that, we should also believe that he repaid, or else we need to confirm the document independently.<br /><br />Art: Convention signed in London by Paul Cambon 1843-1924 the French Ambassador and Lord Salisbury 1830-1904 the British Prime Minister from Le Petit Journal 9th April 1899, by Tofani, Oswaldo Meaulle, F.L. &amp; - Anglo French&nbsp;

There, each one is holding his end of the garment, and should his fellow drop it, the garment would partially rest on the floor, which would mean that our claimant has yet to acquire it since complete lifting is required. We must conclude that when they lift the garment, both intend to help the other acquire it.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Maidens Picking Flowers by a Stream [Study] by John William Waterhouse</div>

Bechorot 10 – If The Firstborn Donkey Is Not Redeemed...

Rabbah said: “Even Rabbi Shimon, who permits using the firstborn donkey before redeeming it with a sheep, agrees that after decapitation it can't be used. What is the reason? Compare it to a calf that was <i>decapitated</i> to atone for an unsolved murder case; this calf was buried in the valley and not used. So too the <i>decapitated</i> donkey cannot be used.”
<br />
<br />
How does Rabbah know Rabbi Shimon's opinion? Because in the list of foods that can become impure Rabbi Shimon does not include the meat of a decapitated donkey. We must conclude that Rabbi Shimon deems it forbidden for benefit, thus, one cannot sell it even for others to eat. However, the Talmud rejects his proof: perhaps donkey meat is not food simply because people don't usually eat it? This attack is parried: the prohibition of the Torah to eat it elevates it to the status of food.
<br />
<br />
And Rabbah? “Since he caused loss to a kohen, his donkey should now be lost to him” describes the position of Rabbi Shimon.

A generous person gives a sheep worth 4 zuz, stingy – 2 zuz, and average – 3 zuz, and a zuz is $50. However, even a very lean sheep worth $10 will also make the redemption.  Alternatively, one can give anything of value, even cooked vegetables, but then the amount should be equal to the worth of the donkey.<br />
<br />
If one redeems his fellow's firstborn donkey, it is valid. Does he acquire the donkey? Do we say that it is similar to consecrated property, and the redeemer acquires it, or do we say that it still belongs to the owner, since he could have redeemed it with a very cheap sheep? The answer comes from the rule about stealing a firstborn donkey. If a thief were to steal it, he would pay the owner double, the usual penalty for stealing from an individual, and not single, the penalty for stealing consecrated property. We see then that it belongs to the owner, and we can conclude that it is not like&nbsp;consecrated&nbsp;property, and that the redeemer does not acquire it.<br />

Rabbi Eliezer allows redemption with a hybrid, because both a goat and a sheep separately can be used.<br />
<br />
Can we redeem a firstborn donkey with a live fetus found in a womb of a slaughtered sheep? Is it a live sheep, good for a redemption, or, since it does not require proper slaughter, it is considered as meat already slaughtered, not valid for redemption? Can one use a mutant – an animal that is similar to a different species? Is it close enough to hybrid, which is forbidden?  Can one use a disqualified sacrifice? Since the sanctity of a donkey cannot possibly go over to the sacrifice, the redemption is not possible, or does this sanctity just fly away? Can one use the produce of the seventh (Shemittah) year for redemption? Is it closer to prohibited commerce or to permitted food?<br />

If one designated a sheep for the redemption of a firstborn donkey, and the sheep died, the owner is responsible to replace it with another lamb, just as a father of a firstborn boy is responsible to replace the redemption money, should be it lost before it reaches the kohen – this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. However, the Sages say that the owner is not responsible for the replacement lamb, just as he is not responsible for the second tithe, which, if lost, need not be replaced.
<br />
<br />
If one buys the fetus of an idolaters cow or sells him his own cow's fetus – although he is not allowed to do so, or buys the cow jointly with an idolater – the cow is exempt from the law of firstborn, because the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=3#P3703">all firstborn in Israel</a>” – but not in other nations. 
<br />
<br />
By contrast, the kohanim and Levites are included in the obligation of the firstborn of kosher animals. They were only excluded from the redemption of their sons and donkeys. Thus, a kohen who owns a cow, sheep or goat that gives birth to a male as it first offspring brings it as an offering.

Actually, if one consecrates a blemished animal as a sacrifice, no consecration occurs at all, but if he says, “I am consecrating this blemished animal in order that it be sold, and a sacrifice brought with the money,” then, although he violated a prohibition, the animal needs to be redeemed.
<br />
<br />
After redemption it is again liable to the law of firstborn (that's the connection of this ruling to "Bechorot"), it may be shorn and put to work, and its offspring is permitted. Now, if the offspring was born after redemption, obviously it is permitted, and if it was born before the redemption, it should be forbidden, because it is unblemished, fit for a sacrifice! However, its law cannot be more strict than that of its mother's - who is permitted.
<br />
<br />
If it dies, its carcass may still be redeemed. But usually for redemption the animal needs to stand up, which a dead animal cannot do! However, this is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who requires standing only for real sacrifices. Those who disagree with him would indeed disallow redemption and require the animal to be buried.

Bechorot 15 – If a Consecrated Animal Became Blemished

Why is this? The Torah said about a redeemed sacrifice, “You can eat it, like a deer or an ibex.” The extra word “deer” teaches us that it is not subject to the laws of firstborn, just as a deer is not subject to them, and the extra word “ibex” - that the kohen's gifts need not be given – just as they need not be given from an ibex.
<br />
<br />
The redeemed animal cannot be shorn or put to work, and its milk is prohibited. Why? The Torah said, “you may slaughter it” - but not shear it or work with it, “for its meat” - but not drink its milk. Finally, “and you will eat” teaches that you may not give it to your dogs. In general, an animal that's once been a consecrated may not be redeemed with the purpose of feeding it to the dogs.

Of course, if the animal gave birth after redemption, its offspring is completely permitted, but here it was pregnant when it was redeemed. What can you now do with the offspring? We cannot bring it as a sacrifice, since it was born from a mother that was a disqualified  and therefore rejected sacrifice. Neither can we redeem it, because the offspring never became a sacrifice. Therefore, said Rav Huna, they have to be locked in a room and left to die. However, in Israel they said that one should sanctify the fetus before birth, to be the same sacrifice type as its mother, and then the redemption of its mother won't affect it and it will be a fit sacrifice.

If one accepts animals from an idolater as fixed-income investment, that is, they will share in the offspring, but he promises to later return the fixed sum, the cost of the animals at the start of the deal – the animals are exempt from the laws of firstborn, because the idolater has a lien on them and can claim them in lieu of payment.<br />

Rav Huna understands this to mean only the next generation, but Rav Yehudah says that the next two generations are exempt, because this is how far the lien extends. They derive their respective views from the analysis of the dissenting opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who says that all generations are exempt.

<br />
If an ewe gave birth to two male lambs and their heads emerged from the womb simultaneously, then Rabbi Yose HaGlili says that both are firstborn and both are given to a kohen, since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=13#P1880">The males belong to God</a>.” However, the Sages disagree and say that it is impossible for two events to happen exactly at the same time. Therefore, one was the firstborn, only we don't know which one, and the kohen gets one animal. Rabbi Yose then says that this Torah phrase is exactly the source teaching that simultaneous events occur. And the Sages? The say that “males” just means all males in general.

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/12/bechorot-17-how-many-generations-of.html">Rabbi Yose said</a> that events in nature can occur simultaneously, and certainly in human effort one can be exactly precise. The Sages disagreed about events in nature, either because events rarely occur simultaneously, or because the error in our measurement will not let us ascertain this. What would they say about human effort?
<br />
<br />
Does the red line exactly in the middle of the Altar prove that one can be exact? – No, it doesn't, for perhaps it was intentionally&nbsp;drawn&nbsp; thicker to account for error.<br />
<br />
If one breaks a ritually impure clay oven into pieces, the pieces are pure, but if he divides it exactly in half, both pieces remain impure - because one piece is the larger one and is impure, only we don't know which. Thus, precision is impossible!? – No! clay has jugged edges, but perhaps with other materials one can be precise.<br />
<br />
If a murder victim is found exactly between two cities, they jointly bring a calf for atonement&nbsp; - because in reality the body is closer to one city - which makes this city obligated to bring the calf - only we don't know which one. This proves that one cannot be precise!? -- Yes, it does.

Bechorot 19 – What Is Considered A Firstborn?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

In the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/12/bechorot-17-how-many-generations-of.html">previously discussed case of simultaneous births</a>, the final law follows the view of the Sages that things cannot be so precise. Therefore, one of the two born males is the real firstborn, but we don't know which one. Rabbi Tarfon says that the strongest and best is usually born first, and therefore the kohen gets the better one. However, later Rabbi Tarfon changed his mind. Rabbi Akiva says that the kohen would have to prove his claim in court, and since he can't, he gets the worse one. 
<br />
<br />
The remaining lamb still might be a firstborn, and for this reason it is let to graze until it develops a blemish, and then it may be slaughtered and consumed. From this second one, the kohen gets the gifts, because he can advance the following two-prong argument: if it is a firstborn, it should completely belong to me, and if it is not, at least the gifts should belong to me!
<br />
<br />
To have the law of the firstborn, the animal needs to be a male, be the first offspring of its mother, and be vaginally delivered, because the Torah required it to be the “first one to open the womb.”

A firstborn donkey has to be redeemed with a sheep or a goat, which is then given to a kohen. A firstborn kosher animal, if it is a male, has to be given to a kohen, who then brings it as a sacrifice. A firstborn human male is redeemed by giving money to a kohen. Today the law of a firstborn still applies, but in the absence of a Temple, animals are made exempt from this law by joint ownership of the mother animal with a non-Jew.<br />
<br />
The teacher will first discuss the exemptions from the law of the firstborn, and in these he will start with the donkey, because its laws are simpler.<br />
<br />
If one buys a fetus of an idolater’s donkey, or he sells his donkey’s fetus, even though he is not allowed to do this, the fetus is exempt from the law of the firstborn. The same is true for various kinds of joint ownership, because the Torah said “all firstborn in Israel,” – but not owned jointly with a non-Jew.

A goat is capable of kidding once it her first year, but not twice, as she will in the following years. Thus, a kid in her first year is the firstborn. After that, since we don't know if it had offspring while in the possession of the idolater, it is a firstborn out of doubt, that is, it is let to graze until it develops a blemish, and is then consumed by the owner. For an ewe the period is two years, and for a cow – three.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva said to Rabbi Ishmael, “If the law was that only actual birth exempts from the law of firstborn, it would be indeed as you say. But since even a miscarriage also exempts from it, it is never a definite firstborn, unless we know for sure.”

For example, the triplet daughter goats may be born on the first of Elul, and after six months each daughter conceived. Five months later, before the next Elul, each of the triplet herself bore triplet, and since the accounting for tithe goes from Elul to Elul, and there were at least ten of them, the whole family goes into the same pen for tithing. Rabbi Shimon says, “I myself saw a progeny of a single goat tithed within her first year.”
<br />
<br />
What is Rabbi Shimon saying differently? There are a few possible explanations. (1) The three sister goats miscarried on the last day of the sixth months, and the argument is whether a goat then refuses to mate for the next thirty days; (2) Again, they miscarried, but the argument is can a goat bear young before five months; (3) They agree that the goat needs five full months, but they argue whether a part of the day is considered as complete day; (4) They argue if a premature animal is tithed.

If one buys an animal from a Jew, then, unlike a non-Jew, this seller knows about various implications of the law  of firstborn, and therefore we treat his statements or his silence differently. Rav said that the first offspring of the bought animal is a definite firstborn. Had the animal previously given birth, the seller would praise it now, because subsequent births are far less risky than the first one. He is silent because the animal has not given birth yet.
<br />
<br />
Shmuel says that the animal only might be a firstborn: the seller assumes that the buyer wants the animal for immediate slaughter, and firstborn simply doesn't matter. Rabbi Yochanan says that the first offspring is definitely not a firstborn: the Jew knows how serious the law of firstborn is, and he would certainly alert the buyer if the possibility of firstborn existed.
<br />
<br />
What is a sign of miscarriage in a large animal? If it discharged a bloody substance, which looks like a hard cake, it may contains disintegrated remains of a firstborn fetus. It must be buried, because a firstborn is prohibited for benefit. Afterwards, the mother is free from the law of firstborn.

Resh Lakish said, “One who buys fish brine from an ignorant person, not knowledgeable in the laws of purity, can purify this brine in the following way: make it slightly touch (kiss) the waters of a mikveh, and it will be pure. If this brine contains more than half water, then the water will be purified, and if it has more than half brine, then it's not proper food, does not accept food impurity, and the water in it is nullified.”
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yirmiyah added, “This advice is only good to dip your bread in it, but not to put it into a pot for cooking. Why not? Because the dormant impure water will combine with the water in the pot, its impurity will wake up and make the whole pot impure.”
<br />

Abbaye was surprised, “Can nullified impurity re-awaken? Consider the blood cake of a miscarriage we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/12/bechorot-22-buying-animal-from-jew.html">learned about previously</a>. It carries no impurity. But if, as you say, the impurity lies there dormant, one should become impure by carrying it, since in it are found all the pieces of the fetus, which are impure!” Rabbi Yirmiyah was silent and did not find a good answer.

While there are some animals that lactate before giving birth, in general animals do not nurse a child that is not their own. Also in a flock one can assume that each animal nurses its own child. A different point of view is that an animal will nurse a child not of its own even before it has given birth.
<br />
<br />
If one saw a young pig clinging to an ewe and nursing from it, the ewe is exempt from the law of a firstborn, because we can assume that this is not a pig but a mutant lamb. One can't eat it, because perhaps it is a pig after all. This rule seems to combine the two contradictory points of view above: does an animal feed a child that is not its own or it doesn't? The author thought that perhaps all agree that an animal may have mercy on another child, after it had its own.

Bechorot 25 – Shearing a Firstborn

How is one to deal with the hair of the firstborn animal while slaughtering it? Rabbi Yose ben Meshulam gave a rule: one can clear the area on the neck for the shechitah incision. One may even pluck out the hair, but leave it in place, to avoid the impression that he is shearing it. Can one do it on a Yom Tov holiday? Is plucking not considered sharing, but it would still be prohibited on a Yom Tov, or is plucking permitted because he does not have the intention to shear, and in that case it would be allowed even on a Yom Tov? They asked Rav Huna, and he said that it is allowed.
<br />
<br />
If he does shear a firstborn, the wool is still prohibited for benefit. If some wool fell out and was placed in storage for safekeeping, and then the firstborn was slaughtered, the wool is now permitted. This is also true for wool that was sheared illegally while the firstborn was alive, but the teacher did not want to mention it.

Even he allowed it only when an expert examined the animal and found a defect in it. The wool stored while the animal was alive becomes permitted after slaughter. The Sages prohibit this wool out of concern that one may keep the firstborn for a long time and not give it to a kohen.
<br />
<br />
One is obligated to care for a firstborn until it grows to a certain age, before giving it to a kohen. For a small animal this time period is thirty days, and for a large one – fifty. Rabbi Yose requires three months for a small animal.
<br />
<br />
How did the Sages arrive at these specific care-periods? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=22#P2140">Your first fruit you shall not delay... so you shall do to your ox</a>,” &nbsp;and this additional “do” was understood as an extra twenty days. The Torah was intentionally vague about the limits in the first place, giving the Sages a “blank check” to fill in the amounts, and they compared firstborn to first fruit. Rabbi Yose says that the Sages estimated the time that an animal is dependent on its mother.<br />

Bechorot 27 – Kohen Helping on the Threshing Floor

Why not? Because that kohen will appear as working for a reward. The firstborn animal is a gift, and it must be given freely and in a dignified manner. This is similar to a Kohen who would help on the threshing floor to later get his portion (terumah), or a Levite in a like situation, to get his tithe, and the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4287">Do not profane the holies of the Children of Israel, so that you will not die</a>.”<br />
<br />
So that the laws of terumah, or the Kohen's portion, were not forgotten, the Sages instituted it to be given in lands close to Israel even nowadays, but they made its laws more lenient. For example, it is nullified in a simple majority of regular produce, not in 1 in 100. There are similar leniencies regarding challah, the kohen's portion from dough, which the Sages required to give in all lands.

Bechorot 28 – When Must the Firstborn Animal Be Eaten?

What does this mean? If a firstborn was born blemished, it does not have the full holiness of the firstborn and therefore is allowed to be eaten. In that case it must be slaughtered and eaten within a year from its birth. 
<br />
<br />
If the firstborn was born unblemished then in the time of the Temple it becomes eligible to be offered in the Temple after eight days. Within a year after this time it must indeed be brought as a sacrifice, slaughtered, and eaten by a Kohen and his family. Today an unblemished firstborn poses a problem: the owner must care for it and then give it to a Kohen. He cannot force the kohen to accept it, because it is a present, so if he cannot find a Kohen, he continues to care for it until it develops a blemish, however long this takes.
<br />
<br />
One can only slaughter a firstborn through the permission of an expert. If one first slaughtered it, and then showed it to an expert, Rabbi Yehudah permits it to be eaten, but Rabbi Meir forbids it because of a possible confusion.

<br />
<br />
In general, if one adjudicated a monetary case, or a question of ritual purity, and caused a monetary damage by his incorrect decision, he needs to make restitution from his own property. However, if the judge was regarded a legal expert by the official court and they authorized him, then he does not have to make a restitution, because he is similar to an authorized slaughterer who bungled the slaughter.
<br />
<br />
If one takes a payment to inspect firstborns, his rulings are void, unless he is an exceptionally saintly person and takes a standard fee regardless of the outcome.
<br />
<br />
One should not take a fee for judging, testifying, or sprinkling the waters of a red heifer, and if he does, his actions are void. Just as <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5007">God taught Torah to Moses for free</a>, so one should teach others for free. However, he can be compensated for the wages lost by taking off from work, assuming he is paid as a laborer.

Bechorot 3 – Selling an Animal to a Non-Jew

We learned that although selling an animal to a non-Jew removes it from the laws of firstborn, in general it is forbidden to do so. Why? Some say that since a Jew does not make his animal work on Shabbat, and the non-Jew does, we should not remove the animal from the Shabbat observance. Others say that once an animal is completely owned by a non-Jew, its Shabbat observance should not concern us. Rather, if one is allowed to sell livestock, eventually he may come to rent it out, and then the Jew will have caused his animal to work on Shabbat. Finally, some say that “forbidden to do so” refers here to removing the animal from the sanctity of the firstborn. (Nowadays the custom is to permit this).
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah allows selling an animal with a broken leg, because it can’t work anyway. What would he say about selling a firstborn fetus? Is it allowed, because it can’t work now, or is it prohibited, because it will be able to work later? Since in another place he gives the reason “because it cannot heal,” and this reason does not apply to a fetus, we deduce that he prohibits it.

It is likewise forbidden to buy raw hides from him, but tanned hides are permitted: since, if he were discovered, he would loose the hide, he won't put that much labor into the hide of a firstborn.
<br />
<br />
One who is suspect of violating the laws of the seventh year (shemittah) is nevertheless trusted regarding tithes. He may consider tithes more stringent, because they are eaten within the walls of Jerusalem. Conversely, one who is suspect regarding tithes is still trusted regarding shemittah: he may regard shemittah as more stringent, since the produce of shemittah cannot not be redeemed for money. Rabbi Yochanan remarked, “That is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, who authored many anonymous rulings, but Rabbi Meir would say that one who is suspect regarding a single commandment is suspect regarding all.”
<br />
<br />
If a convert accepted on himself the code of the Torah and then became suspect regarding only one aspect of it, he is considered suspect regarding all areas; however, his conversion is not invalidated. A Kohen who denies one commandment cannot serve in the Temple.

Since the firstborn was sanctified at birth, then even after it received the blemish, it must be treated with respect. In fact, this is true about any sacrifice if it got a blemish and was redeemed, but there are some differences between firstborn and sacrificial animals.
<br />
<br />
The redemption money of a blemished sacrifice goes to the Temple, where it is used to bring another sacrifice. Therefore the Sages, following the rule that the Temple is always treated preferentially, tried to maximize the Temple's profit. The meat of such sacrifices can be sold in a market, and it can be weighed in a regular way. However, the meat of a firstborn animal has to be sold by the Kohen from his house and cannot be doled out using weights. Instead, a piece of regular meat can be weighed, and the meat of the firstborn is then weighed against this meat. People will pay less in a limited market and without precise weight, but that is acceptable.

There is, however, a problem with this rule: animal tithe scannot be sold at all! Rav Sheshet pondered the problem in the evening but resolved it the next morning: it is talking about tithes left to the orphans by their father! 
<br />
<br />
Rav Idi, the assistant of Rav Sheshet, repeated this explanation without mentioning the author, and Rav Sheshet was upset. But why? If they repeat a true teaching, it should be enough! However, in the Song of Songs we have the verse, “The utterance of your palate is like a choice wine; it goes to my Beloved with sincerity, stirring the lips of those who sleep (in the grave).” When someone quotes a teaching in a sage's name, his lips stir in the grave. Of the three souls, the lower one stays in the grave and assumes the form of the body.
<br />
<br />
The orphans were given this special dispensation to protect their financial interests. However, all others have a loophole: they give the meat as a present, and ascribe the charge to the hoofs or horns.

However, Beit Shammai use the Torah phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4273">Their flesh will be yours like the breast of waving</a>...” - to prove that only the Kohanim can eat it. Beit Hillel say that this phrase applies only to unblemished firstborn. Instead, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=12#P5257">the ritually pure and impure can eat it</a>” is applicable here - and a non-Kohen is certainly included, since he can be pure. Beit Shammai answer that the ritually impure cannot be used for any proof, since the Passover offering is brought even when the Community of Israel is impure, but not by a non-Kohen. And Beit Hillel? They answer that this is talking about service, and they are talking about eating.
<br />
<br />
It is forbidden to inflict a blemish on a firstborn animal. If blood-letting is necessary for a firstborn animal to survive, Rabbi Yehudah still forbids it, since once you permit that, people will inflict other blemishes. They Sages say that if you prohibit bloodletting, people will certainly cause blemishes on purpose, thus the Sages allow blood-letting, but not the slaughter, should the blemish indeed occur.<br />

Bechorot 34 – Blemish Caused on Purpose

However, if we penalize him for the future, that will stop him. The Sages also forbid the slaughter based on this blemish, but they do allow it should a new, unrelated blemish occur. The Sages penalize him just for what he did, but not for the future.
<br />
<br />
If one blemished the ear of a firstborn animal and then died, is his son permitted to slaughter it? Did the Sages penalize only him or even his son? Now, you cannot derive the answer from the case where one sold his slave to an idolater, and the Sages did penalize his son and required him to redeem the slave, since every day the idolater forces the slave to transgress the Torah. Rather, compare this to one who improved his fields in the seventh year,&nbsp;Shmita, and then&nbsp;died, and the Sages allowed the son to use the field. We see thus that the son is not penalized.

Bechorot 35 – Unwitting Intentional Blemishes

When he found out that Jews could not do anything with an unblemished firstborn, he notched its ear with a spear, and the Sages allowed to slaughter the animal. He did this to other firstborns, but now the Sages forbade to slaughter.
<br />
<br />
Once kids tied the tails of lambs together, and caused a blemish in a firstborn, and the Sages allowed to slaughter it. The kids continued doing this, but the Sages forbade further slaughter.
<br />
<br />
If a firstborn was pursuing someone, and he kicked it and inflicted a blemish, they may slaughter it on the basis of this blemish. If he came over to kick it later, this blemish is prohibited. Now, this is obvious!? You might have said that he is releasing his pent-up anger, and this is a valid blemish, so the rule is that it's not. Some teach the opposite: if he became angry later and kicked it, this blemish permits the slaughter.
<br />
<br />
When an expert finds a blemish that could have been inflicted by a man, he needs a witness to testify that is was accidental, but people with vested interest cannot testify.

Bechorot 36 – Who Can Be Believed About a Blemish
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjI0saN39doX5Je-dy5dNpos9y4Cqe0kSgM7j0UUgMoKwSu51u3a0OUqPvbKDvbotXWSuQuwBnXU1z1i3RgTrDWC7vlmObd_DROabNo9SfRVoy-8FmVqKu0XH2dmdgQYshpG0wWAnWjyE/s1600/James+Riddel+-+A+Goat+With+Her+Kid.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="259" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjI0saN39doX5Je-dy5dNpos9y4Cqe0kSgM7j0UUgMoKwSu51u3a0OUqPvbKDvbotXWSuQuwBnXU1z1i3RgTrDWC7vlmObd_DROabNo9SfRVoy-8FmVqKu0XH2dmdgQYshpG0wWAnWjyE/s320/James+Riddel+-+A+Goat+With+Her+Kid.jpg" width="320" /></a>When there is no Temple and a firstborn cannot be brought as a sacrifice, a Kohen stands to gain most when a firstborn has a blemish. Therefore, although a regular Jewish shepherd is believed to testify that a certain blemish occurred naturally and he did not cause it, a Kohen shepherd is not believed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that he is believed concerning some else's firstborn, but not about his own, and Rabbi Meir says that one suspected concerning something can neither judge nor testify about it. Each teacher explains his reasons to trust or not to trust in a given situation, and the hopes of gain or inner justifications that a liar may have. In addition, “Kohen shepherd” may refer to a shepherd who happens to be a Kohen, or alternatively to anyone who works for a Kohen as a shepherd. Thus the Talmud goes through the two sets of possible reasons.<br />
<br />
A Kohen is believed to say, “I showed this firstborn to an expert, and he concluded that it is permanently blemished, so I can slaughter it” - because in matters that may be discovered people usually don't lie.

Obvious defects include a blind eye, a cut-off limb and other similar ones, and the examiners must be somewhat familiar with the laws of firstborn. 
<br />
<br />
If one sells the meat of a firstborn without showing its blemish to an expert and the buyer eats some of it, the seller is penalized to refund the full price, and the rest of the meat is buried. Similarly, if one sells beef and it is found to be non-kosher, but the buyer already ate some, the seller refunds the fulls price. In general, this rule applies to anything that is considered disgusting, such as non-kosher meat or forbidden seafood, because the buyer would rather not have eaten it. However, if the food is prohibited only by a Rabbinical decree, the buyer cannot claim refund for what he already ate.
<br />
<br />
Blemishes qualifying for slaughter include ear notched in the cartilage but not in the skin, ear split, punctured, and dried up.

The first group of blemishes that can happen to a firstborn animal, leading it to loose its holiness and allow it to be slaughtered outside the Temple were <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/12/bechorot-37-blemished-firstborn-animals.html">blemishes of the ear</a>. But how do we know the law of the blemishes altogether? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=15#P5335">If an animal has a blemish</a>” – include any blemish whatsoever. Then it continued “such as when it is crippled or blind” - to limit it only to blemishes that stop it from doing work. Then it generalized again, “any other blemish” to widen the definition, and include even permanent blemishes that don't stop it from doing work, such as the ones in the ear. And then the Torah limited it again, saying “serious” blemish, to exclude permanent blemishes that are not visible, such as in the gums inside the mouth. This method of Torah logic is called “amplification and limitation.”
<br />
<br />
The blemishes in the eye include punctured, notched, or split eyelid, a cataract (which requires special expertise), unusual growths, the white of the eye entering the black (but not the black entering the white), white flecks - a condition leading to blindness, and watery eyes if this completely obstructs the vision.

One needs to feed the animal first dry fodder (meaning, grown in dry months), then moist fodder (grown in moist months), coming from rain-watered fields, for three months, not in any other combination of factors. If the condition still persists, it is a sign that the blemish is permanent. 
<br />
<br />
How much fodder has to be administered? – The volume of a dried fig. Should it be given at each meal or at the first meal? Before the meal or after? Before drinking or after? Should the animal be fettered or free to roam, in the city or in the field, and if in the field, is a garden next to the city good enough? All these questions remained unresolved.
<br />
<br />
Blemishes of the nose: if it was punctured, notched, or split, and the same for the lip. Qualifying blemishes of the mouth: front gums notched or cut, back gums completely uprooted. Rabbi Chanina ben Antignos says: “Gums from the molars and beyond are considered hidden blemishes and are therefore never examined, gums under molars including.”

Jacob, who was born second, had to buy this right from Esau. This was still the practice when Jews came out of Egypt. However, when the firstborn worshiped the Golden Calf, they lost their privilege and were superseded by the Levites, the only group who did not participate.<br />
<br />
To transfer the Temple rights of the firstborn to the Levites, the firstborn were counted, and the Levites were taken as an exchange for them. Of the total number of 22,300 Levites, 300 were themselves first-born, and could not be used to redeem the other firstborn, so 300 firstborn had to redeem themselves with money.<br />
<br />
We can see that the Levites and the Kohanim (who are members of the tribe of Levy) are exempt from the laws of firstborn with the "a fortiori" reasoning: if they could exempt other firstborn, then certainly they can exempt themselves. The firstborn donkeys are mentioned by the Torah in the same phrase with the human firstborn to tell us that their law is the same, that is, the Levites are free from the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/11/bechorot-2-laws-of-firstborn.html">obligation of the firstborn donkey</a>.<br />

Rabbi Elazar said, "The sheath is a blemish only if notched, but if completely missing, it will eventually grow back."<br />
<br />
A firstborn that has no testicles is blemished. If it has one testicle, Rabbi Ishmael says that if it has two pouches, it is a sign that it has a second testicle, and one need not check. Rabbi Akiva says that one needs to set it on its buttocks and squeeze, and the second testicle, if it's there, will come down, otherwise, it is a blemish. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri disagrees and says that even a testicle that is present but does not descend is not a blemish.
<br />
<br />
An animal that has five legs or three legs is blemished, but if a hind leg is missing, then it is in addition a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> and cannot be eaten anyway, even with a blemish.

Their owner is left with no alternative but to wait, either until the animal develops a full-fledged blemish, or until the disqualifying condition leaves. These are: white flecks or water in the eye that are not permanent; back gums that were notched but not uprooted; an animal that has a wart or a boil, one that is old, sick, or foul-smelling; an animal which was a passive or active participant in bestiality; one that killed a person, but according to the testimony of only one witness – which prevents it from being a sacrifice but does not allow the court to execute it.
<br />
<br />
An animal whose genitals are covered with skin so that its gender it unclear, or one with both sets of genitals cannot be slaughtered anywhere, because that is another not-so-severe blemish. Rabbi Ismael considers the second set of genitals a blemish which permits to slaughter the animal. Another opinion considers such an animal a separate species to whom the laws of firstborn don't apply at all.

A practical consequence of this viewpoint is that a firstborn animal of undefined gender is to be treated as a potential firstborn male, not to be worked, and not to be slaughtered until it develops a blemish. Talmud is now going to challenge this.
<br />
<br />
One can donate a personal valuation to the Temple (subject of the next Tractate),  which is defined only for a definite male or a female, but not an androgyne and not an undefined gender. But God knows about every being of undefined gender what it really is, so why did the Torah have to exclude it?!  Rav Chisda will answer, “The text of the rule is incorrect, it should not include undefined gender.” Several more challenges will be deflected in a similar way, and it will turn out that the disagreement dates back to much earlier times, with both points of view being equally valid.

Moreover, there are blemishes for animals that are not listed for Kohanim, and vice versa, but in truth all blemishes listed for one apply to the other. This is learned from the use of an extra word “wart” that is found in both laws and that connects them. Without this connection, we could argue that an animal's law should be stricter, since it itself is brought on the Altar, or alternatively that the Kohen's law is stricter, since he can perform many Temple services.
<br />
<br />
Unique to Kohanim is a requirement to be a typical descendant of Aharon. Thus it becomes a blemish to have a deformed head, and a hunchback, although Rabbi Yehudah declares a hunchback fit for Temple service. A bald-headed man is unfit. What is defined as bald? Whoever has no ring of hair circling from ear to ear.
<br />
<br />
A disqualified Kohen may still eat of the Kohanim's portions, and he has a claim to an equal share, together with all the members of his family, when the family gets its turn to serve in the Temple.

Bechorot 44 – Three Groups of Blemishes in a Kohen

What is the practical difference between the two? Both types cannot serve in the Temple and are liable to lashes if they do, but only the first one makes the actual service invalid.
<br />
<br />
There is also a third group of disqualifications, called “unsightly appearance,” such as one with a sunken nose or whose lashes have fallen out. If such a Kohen serves in the Temple, he merely transgresses a commandment derived by implication, for which there is no punishment.
<br />
<br />
Further blemishes, some more strict, some less, and some added by the Sages, include an eye as large a calf's eye, or as small as that of a goose, a body too large for the limbs, or the limbs too large for the body, ears too small, an upper lip protruding beyond the lower one, and teeth that have fallen out – the last one because of unsightly appearance. Also included are abnormally bulging breasts and belly.
<br />
<br />
There are 50 blemishes shared with animals and 90 unique to Kohanim.

<br />
<br />
One who has extra digits in his hands and feet, that is, six on each  – Rabbi Yehudah declares him fit, but the Sages say that he is unfit. They argue about a phrase in Samuel, “There was another war, and there was a man of huge stature, with six fingers on his hands and feet.” The Sages consider these words a shame, but Rabbi Yehudah considers them a praise.
<br />
<br />
A left-handed Kohen cannot serve in the Temple because he lacks a legally recognized right hand, and many services require it. An ambidexterous Kohen – Rabbi Yehudah the Prince assumes that this is due to the weakness in the right hand, which makes it a blemish, but the Sages say that it is his left hand that grew unusually strong, thus, he is fit.

A Kohen married to a woman prohibited to him cannot serve until he vows to divorce, and likewise one who visits cemeteries.
<br />
<br />
A child can be a firstborn for inheritance but not a firstborn for a Kohen – that is, he does not need to be redeemed by giving five silver coins to a Kohen. How so? If a woman was pregnant with twins, and the head of one emerged first, but then retracted and he died, and the second child was born healthy. The firstborn for a Kohen is the one who “opened the womb of his mother,” and that was the first child. The firstborn for inheritance is the first viable child, and that is the second one.

Bechorot 47 – How Does One Recognize a Face?

However – said Resh Lakish – for the purposes of firstborn inheritance, it is not considered born until his face appears. If he retracts his head and another child appears, the other child will be the firstborn. That is because the word <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=21#P5459">“recognize” is used talking about the firstborn</a>, and for that the complete face must be seen. Rabbi Yochanan says that even here the forehead is enough. Resh Lakish poses multiple questions to Rabbi Yochanan, which the latter answers by emending the rulings. Finally, he answers that perhaps&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;a firstborn  by the forehead is possible while in other situations a full face is needed. 
<br />
<br />
If a woman did not wait for the prescribed three months before remarrying, and her firstborn child does not know the true father, he is the firstborn for the Kohen but not for inheritance. But then he should not get any inheritance, since he can't prove paternity! He should sue the other children jointly with the next son, claiming that between them one is a firstborn.

Rather, the first case of this ruling is when a woman has a miscarriage, but an embryo is so undeveloped that it looks full of water or multicolored matter, like a fish or a crawling animal, or if she aborts it on the fortieth day after conception – all these are not considered births, and the next child is a firstborn both for inheritance and for the Kohen. 
<br />
<br />
A firstborns son born by Cesarean section and the naturally born that follows him – neither is a firstborn for either inheritance – because the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=21#P5457">And they bore him sons</a>,” and Caesarean is not a classical birth, or the Kohen – because the child needs be both the first and to open the womb. Rabbi Shimon considers the first one firstborn for inheritance, because in his opinion the Caesarean section is legally included in giving birth. He also regards the second one a firstborn for giving the Kohen five silver coins, because he considers either of the two conditions – first birth or first to open a womb – sufficient.

If the son died after thirty days, the father must still give the money. If the son died on the thirtieth day, this is a proof that it was not viable, and the Kohen returns the money. Rabbi Akiva is not certain if it is a proof, so if the Kohen got the money, he need not return it, but the father need not give it now.
<br />
<br />
If a man had two firstborn sons from two wives, and he redeemed the two boys with ten coins, and then one of the boys died, then if he gave all ten coins to one Kohen, the Kohen returns five coins. However, if he gave it to two different Kohanim, then he cannot get his money back, because each Kohen can say that perhaps  he got the money for the son that is alive, and it is the other Kohen who got the money for the one who died.

<br />
Rabbi Yochanan, “But the firstborn brought sacrifices in the desert, before the Tabernacle was built!?” Resh Lakish: “These were firstborn born in Egypt, but not born in the desert. In fact, I have a question against you from your proof: the Tabernacle was built one year after the Exodus, so how could one-year-old firstborn bring sacrifices?” Now, that is so obvious, how could Rabbi Yochanan ask such a question? He answers, “If there was no firstborn sanctification in the desert, the previous one also ceased.”<br />
<br />
Kuntrukos the Roman minister asked Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, “There were two hundred talents of silver collected, but only one hundred was used. Moses your teacher must have been a thief, a&nbsp;kidnapper&nbsp;who hid half the people, or he just could not count.” Rabban Yochanan replied, “Moses our teacher was a trustworthy treasurer and a skilled accountant. However, the talent of the Temple was twice the size of the common unit, thus, the 200 talents collected were only 100 in terms of the Temple units.” How does he know that? From Ezekiel's phrase, “Sixty shekels will be a talent for you,”&nbsp;whereas&nbsp;a regular talent was only thirty shekels.

Since a common payment was a half-shekel, donated yearly by each Jew to the Temple for atonement sacrifices, this half-shekel was called a "shekel," and the full shekel was instead called a "selah". That is why our ruling was formulated in terms of "shekel by the sanctuary standard," and not just a "shekel."
<br />
<br />
The same “shekel of the sanctuary standard” was used for other payments prescribed by the Torah: the fifty-shekel payment of the rapist and of the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=22#P2127">seducer of a virgin young girl</a>, and a one hundred-shekel payment of the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=22#P5478">defamer of his new bride</a>. 
<br />
<br />
These payments can be made with money or with goods, except for the half-shekel collected yearly for sacrifices. They are paid in Tyrian mintage, which was pure silver and eight times more valuable than the “provincial” coins used, for example, for a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/09/daf-in-100-words-gittin-74-divorce-for.html">two hundred-zuz payment</a> of a Ketubah given in the case of divorce. <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&amp;pentid=P2393#C1792">A sanctuary shekel is .8 oz. silver</a>.<br />

To redeem a firstborn one can give to a Kohen either <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/bechorot-50-shekel-selah-and-other.html">five shekel coins or goods</a> worth that amount. However, lands, slaves, and loan documents&nbsp;cannot be used for redemption. Why not? When the Torah said, <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4271">“A firstborn is redeemed from one month old</a>”, it included all means of payment. When it continued, “According to the valuation of five shekels of silver”, it limited the available means somewhat, and when it again generalized, “You shall redeem”, we interpret it to mean that only payments similar to the specified ones are included. Just as coins are movable and have intrinsic value, so too all similar items are included. What's excluded? Lands, because they are not movable. Slaves, because they have the laws of the land. Loan documents, because they are pieces of paper not worth anything by themselves, but only because of the obligation recorded in them.<br />
<br />
If the father wrote the Kohen a note which said “I owe you five shekels”, he has created the obligation and needs to pay at. However, this does not redeem his son, so he needs to pay another five shekels. If the Kohen wants, he can return five shekels as a present.

The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=21#P5459">to him applies the law of the firstborn</a>.” Even though it is talking here about him, the son, it also hints that this law applies only to “him”, the father, and not to “her”, the mother. 
<br />
<br />
If some time passed between the death of the father and the division of the estate, and the property has meanwhile improved (fruit grew on trees), the firstborn does not get a double share in those improvements, but only a regular one, like the rest of the sons. Of course, when he gets the double share of the land, it may happen that together with it he will double share of the improvements, but he will have compensate his brother for them. The Torah said that he gets double from “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=21#P5459">all that is found in his father possession</a>” to tell us that he does not get from what comes to the estate later, after death. He also does not get a double portion from the money owed to his father but uncollected at the time of death.

Bechorot 53 – Animal Tithe Today

He gathers the animals in a pen and lets them out one by one, through a narrow opening. He counts, and marks every tenth one with red dye, saying, “This one is animal tithe.” The tithe animals are brought as sacrifices in the Temple, and are eaten by the owner and his guests in Jerusalem. When there is no Temple, the owner waits till the animals get a blemish, and then he can slaughter them. This is also true for animals born outside of Israel, except that their tithe is not brought to Jerusalem.
<br />
<br />
Today, however, animal tithes would be problematic, because of multiple prohibitions associated with them. As Rav Huna had described, the farmers used to place the animals' mothers outside the pen, with the result that orphaned and bought animals – from whom tithe need not be separated –  would remain inside. The Sages thus instituted not to separate tithes at all, based on the multiple similar situations where the animal tithe would not apply, and about which general population might have been ignorant.

Bechorot 54 – Animal Title by Species and by Year

However, the sheep and goats are combined, because they are collectively designated by the Torah as “flocks”. Furthermore, even though the tithe applies to animals of the last year (if the farmer did not give it yet) as well as of this year, the two years are not combined. Logically, one could reason otherwise and say, “If the animals born in different years, who are not forbidden to be bred between themselves, do not combine for tithe, then sheep and goats, who are forbidden to be bred between themselves, certainly should not combine!” To preclude this, the Torah combined them them as “flocks”.
<br />
<br />
Animals that are spread out are still considered as one flock and are combined for tithe if they are within the same grazing range, that is, about 4,000 feet from each other. If two groups of animals are farther away than that, but there is a group of animals in between them, it serves to combine them. Rabbi Meir says, “Jordan River separates the animals.”

Rav Ashi noted that if there is a bridge there, they do combine. But, by the same token, animals on two sides of the Israeli border should combine, because they can cross – and we know that they don't! Rather, as Rav Chiya explained, Jordan is called a border by the Torah. But then animals on different sides of the tribes' borders should not combined, and they do!? Rav Chiya has to say that the “land” combines all tribes, but “Jordan” is not land.
<br />
<br />
Jordan is called that way because it is “yored mi-dan” - comes from Dan. Its source is the cave of Pameas. Why does it matter? – One who vows not to drink water of Pameas should not drink any Jordan water. Jordan's source – as is the source of all water in the world – is the river Euphrates. Why does that matter? For one who vows against the water of Euphrates. But we judge by common meaning, and that includes only Euphrates' water?! - Rather, if he vows against all water that comes from Euphrates.
<br />
<br />
But how can all water come from Euphrates seeing that there are springs in the high mountains? – They are fed by underground channels. And why is it called Euphrates? Because its waters multiply (“parim” in Hebrew). This teaching supports Shmuel, who said that a river is primarily fed from its bedrock, and disagrees with the father of Shmuel, who would build a separate mikvah for his daughter in Euphrates, because he felt that its water comes at times mostly from rain.

The Torah compared tithes to a firstborn son, and just as children are born into a family and not acquired, so too only animals born in one's herd are tithed. Rabbi Yochanan said: "If one buys ten fetuses in the wombs of their mothers, they will be subject to tithes." Why? Rabbi Elazar said “I saw Rabbi Yochanan in a dream, so my explanation today must be correct.” The Torah said, “So shall you do (tithe)” to exclude animals acquired though an additional act of buying.
<br />
<br />
When is an animal given to a harlot as payment tithed? – When he buys it back. But the sale removes the animal from tithes!? – He gave and re-purchased a fetus. But let the harlot tithe the animal herself!?  – She is a Cuthean harlot who, not being Jewish, does not have to tithe. But why not teach us a case of a Jewish harlot? - Only a harlot whom he cannot marry has her payment forbidden, but if marriage could take effect, her payment can be brought as tithe in the Temple.

Bechorot 57 – Who is Obligated in Animal Tithe

Once they divide it, if they continue to operate it together as partners, they are not obligated to tithe, since no partners are obligated. Incidentally, the law of the “kolbon”, a small coin given in addition to the half-shekel to the Temple, is just the opposite.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/bechorot-53-animal-tithe-today.html">Earlier we said</a> that there are multiple cases when one does not have to give animal tithe. In fact, it is the presence of them that allowed the Sages to suspend the separation of tithes altogether, in the time when there is no Temple. Thus, all animals are obligated in tithes, except for a hybrid, a sick animal (terefah), one born by Caesarean section, and an orphan. What is considered an orphan for tithes? Any animal whose mother died or was slaughtered, and then it (the child) came out of the mother's womb. Rabbi Yehoshua says that if the mother's hide is intact, its offspring is not an orphan, because wrapping it in its mother's hide helps.

Thirty days before a holiday one starts reviewing its laws, and these dates were in the middle. After the designated date, the animals are considered “untithed.” Although there are opinions that the tithing calendar is somewhat different, all agree that these dates were established by the earlier Sages in order that enough animals were available for those going to Jerusalem and bringing sacrifices on the holidays.
<br />
<br />
What is the New Year for animal tithe? Rabbi Meir says that it is the first of Elul, a month before the Rosh HaShana of the first of the month of Tishrei, but Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon both say that it is the same as Rosh HaShana. They argue about when the majority of births occur. The practical importance of this day is that only animals born in the same year combine for the count of ten needed to create the tithe obligation. Ben Azzai says that the New Year for tithe is a very old disagreement which cannot be properly resolved, and therefore animals born in Elul form a separate tithing queue.

He counts them with a staff: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and the one that exits tenth he marks with red dye, and pronounces, “This one is hereby tithe.” 
<br />
<br />
If he did not mark the tenth one with red dye, did not count them with a staff, or did not pass them through a narrow exit, but counted them as they were crouching or standing, they are still tithed, since the Torah said, “And the tenth one will be holy” – even when the correct procedure is not followed. However, if he just ten out of a hundred or one out of ten, without counting all – it is not tithe, because the Torah said “tenth”, but not “ten”. Rabbi Yose ben Yehudah says that it is tithed even in that case, since the Torah said, “It will be considered to you as tithe” - a mental consideration is sufficient.
<br />
<br />
If a counted animal jumped back, all are exempt, but if the tithe animal jumped back, all have the stringency of tithe.

Following rulings discuss the laws of mutants (known as “one that resembles something else”) - first, as they apply to firstborn, and then as they apply to kosher and non-kosher animals.<br />
<br />
If a cow bore a firstborn resembling a donkey, or a donkey bore a firstborn resembling a horse, it is exempt from the laws of firstborn. The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=13#P1881">Firstborn of a donkey</a>,” and then repeated, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2514">Firstborn of a donkey</a>” to tell us that the offspring must resemble his mother, a donkey.<br />
<br />
What is the status of such an animal for consumption, for example, if a cow bore a calf that resembles a donkey? If a kosher animal bore an offspring resembling a non-kosher animal, it is still permitted for consumption, even if it is lacking kosher signs. Conversely, if a non-kosher animal bore an offspring resembling a kosher animal, it is forbidden for consumption. Here is the rule: a product of that which is non-kosher is itself non-kosher, and the product of that which is kosher is itself kosher.<br />

If he counted them as one, then his ninth and tenth animals are messed up: they are both holy to some degree, but not as a complete tithe; therefore, they both need to be allowed to graze until they develop a blemish, and then they can be slaughtered.
<br />
<br />
If he pronounced the ninth animal to emerge from the pen “tenth”, then, realizing his mistake, tried to correct it, calling the tenth animal “ninth”, and then continued counting and called the eleventh animal “tenth”, the ninth is eaten if it gets a blemish, the tenth is the real tithe, and the eleventh is brought as a peace offering. Why ?
<br />
<br />
Calling the ninth animal “tenth” gave it a degree of holiness, and it can't be slaughtered until it develops a blemish. The owner made a mistake calling the tenth “ninth,” but it become tithe through his intent. And, since the word "tenth" was never properly applied, it kept its power and made the eleventh animal a Temple sacrifice. Ninth and eleventh are sanctified because of an extra word "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3600">it will be</a>" holy.

However, this is only true when one tithes himself. If someone sent an agent to tithe his flock, and the agent miscounted, calling the ninth or the eleventh animal “tenth”, then the ninth is indeed sanctified, but the eleventh is not – these are the words of Rav Pappi. Rav Pappa disagrees and says that neither the ninth nor the eleventh become sanctified, because the owner can tell the agent, “I sent you to benefit me, not to harm me, therefore your agency is void.” And Rav Pappi? He says that when the agent called the ninth animal “tenth”, his agency was still in power, he only lost it after this action, and tithe sanctified in error still counts.
<br />
<br />
But how is this different from one who sends an agent to separate the kohen's portion (terumah) from his grain? There, even if the agent miscalculated the generosity of the owner and gave 10% more, or 10% less, his actions stand? -- For kohen's portion, there are indeed people who give generously or stingily, but for animal tithe the owner can say, “You should not have erred.”

The rule that “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/11/chullin-6-mutants.html">whatever comes from kosher is kosher</a>” includes milk. But how do we know that milk is allowed for consumption, given that other parts taken from a live animal are forbidden? Is it because mixture of meat and milk is forbidden, and therefore milk must be permitted? – No, it might be permitted only for benefit. Is it because of Solomon's words “Let the milk of goats be sufficient for your food...” - perhaps that, too, is only to sell it and buy food. Rather, it is because David brought for his brothers cheese made from milk. And if you say there too that he wanted them to sell it – is war the time for trade? Alternatively, it is because Israel is praised as land flowing with milk.<br />
<br />
If a non-kosher fish swallowed a kosher fish, the kosher fish is still permitted to be eaten, and if a kosher fish swallowed a non-kosher fish, the non-kosher is prohibited to be eaten – provided that the fish inside was not spawned. Kosher fish lay eggs, and non-kosher spawn their young; all creatures that bear live young suckle them, while all that lay eggs gather food to feed their hatchlings, except for the bat which, though it lays eggs, nevertheless suckles its young; dolphins reproduce as humans, and some say, with humans. Which dolphins are we talking about? – Mermaids whom human males can impregnate.<br />

Why are these different? – Because they were addressed by the Divine Presence: some people were prophets, fish – in the incident with Jonah, and snake – in Paradise.<br />
<br />
The snake was cursed more than all the beasts, and its pregnancy lasts seven times longer than that of a donkey, that is, seven years. Caesar said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya, “How long is the gestation of a snake?” Rabbi Yehoshua answered, “Seven years.” Caesar then said, “But the philosophers of Athens mated the snakes, and they bore young only after three years!” Rabbi Yehoshua answered, “Those snakes had already been pregnant four years before the Athenians began to study them.” Caesar was not satisfied, “But these snakes copulated when mated by the Athenians, so they could not be pregnant!” Rabbi Yehoshua answered, “The snakes copulate even during pregnancy, as do people.” The Caesar said, “But the Athenians are wise, and can be trusted in their scientific findings!” Rabbi Yehoshua answered, “We the Jewish Sages are wiser than they.”<br />
<br />
Caesar then asked Rabbi Yehoshua to go, best the Athenians in argument, and bring them to Rome. Rabbi Yehoshua successfully evaded all dangers, answered all twelve problems, and tricked them into boarding his ship. He also took some earth from Athens. When he came to Rome, the Caesar saw they they were meek, and said, “These are not they, for the Athenian philosophers are arrogant!” Rabbi Yehoshua tossed some earth upon them, they regained their self-assurance and grew haughty toward the emperor.

If one has a female donkey that had not previously given birth, and it bore two males, he gives one lamb to a kohen as redemption. Although he does not know which one is the firstborn, but one of them is, and it needs redemption. If it bore a male and a female, then it could be that the male is the firstborn, in which case redemption is needed, but it could also be that the female was born first, and then  redemption is not required. Accordingly, he separates a sheep as a possible redemption, but keeps it, because the kohen cannot prove that the sheep belongs to him by right. As always in money matters, the burden of proof is on the claimant, who in this case is the kohen.
<br />
<br />
Before the firstborn donkey is redeemed, it is forbidden for benefit – so says Rabbi Yehudah. What is his reason? – Is there anything that requires redemption that would be permitted to use before redemption? – Certainly not! However, Rabbi Shimon says that it is permitted. What is his reason? – Is there anything whose redemption (sheep) is permitted to use while it itself is forbidden? Of course not!

However, right after this, Beit Hillel allowed more ways to get doves out of a dovecote. The question is around the joy of the Holiday: which school, of Shammai or of Hillel, wants to enhance it more?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan said, “It is a mistake! Somebody transmitted their opinions incorrectly, and Beit Shammai should be stricter, as they are wont to be. ” But this is not necessarily so. It could be that Beit Shammai allows slaughtering and covering the blood only in that specific case, where there is a spade already in the ground, so there is no reason to prohibit it, but normally they would be stricter. 
<br />
<br />
Beit Hillel, in its turn, permits using a ladder to get to the dovecote because it is obviously a ladder for that, not for plastering the roof. But in other cases, they may follow a different logic, not necessarily trying to be lenient. The Talmud finds five more contradictions where Rabbi Yochanan claims that it is a mistake, but the Talmud can explain the opinions as they are recorded without reversing them.

If he designated white ones in a dovecote and in the morning he found black ones or vice versa, they are all forbidden.
<br />
<br />
This rule, however, is obvious! Since he has designated white birds but found black ones, he has to deduce that the white ones flew away, new ones came in, and they are black, and he has not designated them, so they are muktzeh. Talmud would not teach the obvious. Rabbah explains that we deal with two different dovecots, one with white doves and another with black ones. The rule tells us that he can not just say that the doves exchanged dovecots, but rather that they all flew away, and new ones came in.
<br />
<br />
Can we clarify an underlying logical principle from here? There are two ways to decide matters: follow the majority (and the majority of doves are not designated for his consumption) or follow the local situation (and locally, we have just two dovecotes, both designated). So could we say that the world majority is more important than the specific local situation? - No, we cannot. Perhaps in our case, there is a platform in front of the dovecote, and birds from other parts of the world constantly roost there. Therefore, the local birds are mixed with the majority of the world's birds - and that's why they are prohibited. But we cannot derive anything about the local vs. majority question.<br />

However, on Yom Tov, one can cook food, and the work needed for this constitutes an exception to the thirty-nine labors rule.<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai states that one cannot carry a child or a Torah into the street on a Yom Tov. Why not? Because they are not edibles. Beit Hillel allows this. We thus see that Beit Hillel has a rule: once something is permitted for the purposes of cooking, it is permitted for all purposes. But how do we know that this is a general argument and not just one about carrying? They also disagree about lighting the fire: once it is allowed for cooking, Beit Hillel permits it for all other purposes.
<br />
<br />
When one cooks, she needs to give a portion to a Kohen. Beit Shammai prohibited carrying presents to the Kohen: just as one cannot carry the tithe to Kohen on a Yom Tov, so she cannot take other gifts. What does Beit Hillel answer? They say that it is not the same:  tithe cannot be carried because it cannot be separated; will you say the same about Kohen food gifts, which can be separated? - Of course not.

Since cooking is permitted, that too should be allowed; on the other hand, since it could have been done before Yom Tom, maybe it should not be done now?
<br />
<br />
Rava bar Rav Chanan did not have a ready answer. He went to ask Rava, and Rava told him that it is totally permitted to rub ears of grain and crumble legumes on a Yom Tom, and the answer to the query is "yes" - provided it is done with the hands and not a vessel.
<br />
<br />
Ah! But now we found a case of separating tithe on a Yom Tov. He is, after all, making a small winnowing here, and this is when the obligation of tithe begins. And all our logic on the previous page was based on tithing not being permitted on a Yom Tov!? 
<br />
<br />
How are we to deal with the contradiction? In truth, this too is not a problem. This is a mini-winnowing, and only Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that it counts. His senior opponent, Rabbi Yose, the son of Rabbi Yehudah, says that even after hand winnowing, there is still no obligation to tithe, and one can freely snack on the food thus obtained. Thus, our previous logic is justified, and we know how to make mustard.

Since one can cook on a Holiday (Yom Tov), one can also grind spices. However, when crushing rock salt, she should do it in a manner different from weekdays. Why is salt different from spices? Every dish needs salt, so she should have thought of it and crushed it beforehand, but spices - she may decide to cook a special dish that requires them on the spur of the moment. Another reason: spices begin to lose flavor right after they are ground, so it is impossible to prepare them before the Yom Tov.
<br />
<br />
Is there any practical difference between the two reasons? - Yes! - if she knows which dish she will cook. According to the first reason, she should have prepared the spices and cannot grind them now; according to the second reason, they would lose their pungency, so she could not prepare beforehand and is therefore allowed to grind them now.
<br />
<br />
One should not send presents to a friend on a Yom Tov, since people might see them and think that he is sending goods to the market to sell. The only things that are allowed are ready-made portions of food. This is the opinion of Beit Shammai. However, Beit Hillel is not concerned about it. They allow sending animals and fowl, alive or slaughtered, wines, oils, and fine flours - provided that it is not carried by a caravan of three people, because then it looks like trading.

If the Holiday (Yom Tov) is followed by Shabbat, then people celebrating the Yom Tov may completely forget about Shabbat and finish all the provisions and drinks coming to Shabbat with nothing to eat. So that this should not happen, the Sages instituted a reminder in the form of "food mix" or "eruvei tavshilin." This food eruv is prepared before the Yom Tov, by taking some foods in one's hand and declaring "with this eruv (which I will eat on Shabbat) it becomes permitted to me to cook on a Yom Tov for the needs of Shabbat." Normally cooking on a Yom Tov for Shabbat is forbidden, but with this eruv, this, too, becomes allowed.<br />
<br />
Once Rabbi Eliezer was giving a lecture about the laws of Yom Tov, the whole day of Yom Tov. A group of students arose and left, and Rabbi Eliezer commented, "They must have prepared barrels of wine and are rushing to drink it." When the second group left, he said, "They have casks of wine." When the sixth group left, he said, "These are desolate people." Some students, however, remained till the conclusion, and to them, he said, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b08.htm">Go and eat rich food, drink sweet beverages, and do not be melancholy</a>."<br />
<br />
Why was Rabbi Eliezer so strict with his students? After all, there is a mitzvah to eat and drink and be merry on a Yom Tov? - He disagrees with this requirement: all the time one is engaged in Torah study, it takes preference, and only when he stops - then the obligation to eat and drink devolves on him.<br />

Therefore one should not make extravagant purchases - because his income for food won't be increased. However, he can freely spend more for Shabbat and Yom Tov's needs and the Torah education of his children - because the extra amounts will be added to his allotment. Shammai would always buy things in honor of Shabbat from the first day of the week, and if he saw something better - he would buy that too and eat the previous one on a weekday. On the other hand, Hillel was unconcerned, trusting that God would provide him with the needs for Shabbat when the day came.<br />
<br />
If one gives a present to his fellow, he need not inform him, because it will become known to his fellow anyway, and the goal of increased friendship will be achieved. When giving people the Shabbat, why did God tell Moses to inform them about it - even though they were soon to experience it!? - True, but God told Moses to inform them of the hidden qualities of Shabbat: the reward that one gets for it, and the extra soul that one gets on Shabbat and that allows him to eat more with pleasure.<br />

But why do we ask? – For the case when others would want to help him out and bake with his flour for him, can they use the flour? – The answer is that they cannot, but rather, they have to receive from him the ownership of this flour, and then they can cook for him with that flour because it is now theirs.
<br />
<br />
What if he disregarded the prohibition and cooked anyway? Can this be eaten? The Talmud tries to derive the answer from various similar rulings. For example, we know that one can cook for himself for Yom Tov, and if some food is left over for Shabbat – that is fine. However, he should not use this device as a loophole. Can we assume that when he deliberately violates the prohibition of an eruv, it is worse than a loophole and is indeed prohibited? – No, we cannot. Perhaps the Sages were stricter with loopholes than with deliberate violations. On so on, two more attempts, but the question remains unresolved.

Beitzah 18 – Purifying for the Holiday

He must also purify utensils. However, if the Yom Tov follows Shabbat, everything must be purified before Shabbat, saying Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel basically agrees, only they make an exception for the person himself and allow him to go to the mikveh even on Shabbat. 
<br />
<br />
Why can't we purify utensils – they are very much needed! – Because one may come to carry them on Shabbat. Good, but if so, purifying them in one's own courtyard should be permitted! – No, that is an additional precaution, lest one comes to carry in the street. But do we ever make such additional decrees? Talmud tries to prove that we don't but refutes all such proofs. Another explanation: it is prohibited to purify utensils as a precaution against wringing them. What about non-cloth? – Again, additional decree protecting the first one. Again, we go through the proof that such decrees exist. 
<br />
<br />
There is also a third explanation – that one may delay immersions. Now that one knows that he cannot do it on Shabbat, he will rush. The fourth: it appears as if he fixes things on Shabbat. But if so, we should forbid personal immersions!? - No, he looks as if he is cooling off. Again, we go through marginal cases like cooling off in dirty water and find justifications for these too.

Beitzah 2 – An egg

Since one can cook food on a Yom Tov, he won't have to eat the egg raw but make a dish.
<br />
<br />
How are we to understand this argument? If the hen that laid the egg is designated for food, then the egg is part of it and is considered food; how could Beit Hillel prohibit it? And if that hen is kept only for laying eggs, then the egg was not designated for use before the Yom Tov and is, therefore, “muktzeh,” an item that cannot be handled, much less eaten!
<br />
<br />
Rav Nachman ventured this explanation: Beit Shammai does not accept the whole concept of muktzeh. Moreover, they don't even accept a prohibition of “newly created” or “nolad” - something that was not here at all and appeared just now on a Yom Tov. Therefore, there is no reason not to eat the egg. Beit Hillel, on the contrary, subscribes to both prohibitions.
<br />
<br />
That explanation is bizarre, though. Usually, Beit Shammai is the strict one! How can they be more lenient? Moreover, the explanation is self-contradictory. In other places, in the laws of Shabbat, Beit Hillel are said to follow Rabbi Shimon (no muktzeh), and here, in the laws of Yom Tov, they follow Rabbi Yehudah (yes muktzeh)?
<br />
<br />
Actually, there is no problem. Who wrote down the rules (Mishna?) - this is Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. In the laws of Shabbat, when cooking is not allowed, and people are naturally more careful, he formulated the rules leniently. But in the laws of Yom Tov, where cooking is allowed, and people may extend the permissions even further, he formulated the rules more stringently.

Beitzah 3 – More takes on the egg

This happened on the day before. What if that day was Shabbat? Then we have food being prepared on Shabbat for consumption on a Holiday, and that is forbidden. Why? Because the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1953">On Friday they will prepare</a>” – that is, it is on only the weekday that can prepare for Shabbat or Yom Tov, but food cannot be prepared for Yom Tom on Shabbat, even inside the hen. They asked Rabbah, “Shabbat and Yom Tov do not always occur on consecutive days, so the egg should be permitted then!” He answered that the Sages prohibited this in all situations because sometimes Shabbat and Yom Tov fall out on consecutive days.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef said that the egg is forbidden because it is similar to fruit falling from a tree – which is forbidden. But, we may ask, the fruit is only forbidden because we want to stop people from climbing trees and harvesting it so that it is stringency. Why do we need another limitation on top of it? He answered that the Sages prohibited the fruit falling from a tree, and the egg laid on a Yom Tom in one fell swoop.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yitzchak said that the egg is similar to juice flowing from a fruit. They asked him the same question as above: juice is forbidden only because one might come to squeeze it out himself, so it itself is stringency, and you are adding another stringency on top of it! He gave a similar answer that it is all part of one decree.
<br />
<br />
Now we have four possible explanations for the egg, and the Talmud discussed why each of the proponents does not accept the explanation of the others.

Beitzah 4 – And Beit Shammai was lenient

<br />
<br />
Now let's analyze this. If the hen is kept for food – then, of course, it is permitted, and Rabbi Eliezer is not telling us anything new. And if it is kept for laying eggs, then it should be forbidden!? – We are dealing with a special situation where someone bought a hen and did not tell us why. If later we see that he takes that hen to slaughter, we know that both the hen and the egg were designated for food. However, this explanation leads us to analyze the idea of retroactive designation, so let's try another one.
<br />
<br />
Another explanation of Rabbi Eliezer's statement is simply an “exaggeration” or special emphasis. He just wanted to emphasize that the egg can be eaten, so he included even the mother hen and said, “Everything can be eaten!” – even though the second part of the statement is obvious. He did say something similar on another occasion: “The egg may be eaten, and its mother, and the chick, and its shell.” Obviously, the shell is not edible. And if you want to say that he meant, “Chick in a shell” - that nobody allows. We see then that it was said just to make the point.

Beitzah 5 – Why do we observe two days of Yom Tov?

Once the official day beginning the month was known, all Holidays: Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, etc., were set.
<br />
<br />
The Jews in Diaspora, starting with Babylon, had to wait until the messengers of the Court would arrive and tell them about the new moon, and since it often took quite long, they celebrated two days of Holidays (Yom Tov), out of doubt. Only one day of the two was the real Holiday. Therefore, an egg laid on the first day was always permitted on the second. Here is why. Either the first day was the real Holiday, and then the second was a weekday, or the first day was a weekday – and the egg laid then was permitted on the second day.
<br />
<br />
If so, then after the calendar was fixed by Hillel, the last Prince, in about the eighth century – why do people still celebrate two days of Yom Tov? – Because the Sages living in the Land of Israel urged everybody to keep the custom. The fear was that some new government may forbid the study of Torah, the Sages of the Diaspora would forget how to calculate the calendar, and as a result, eat leavened bread on Passover.
<br />
<br />However, it could be that on Rosh HaShana, this reasoning about the egg does not apply because of a series of complicated logical derivations.

Beitzah 6 – A chick

What is its status? Can it be eaten? We have two opinions. One is that it is muktzeh (set aside) – since before it hatched, it was not fit for any use. The other opinion is that it is permitted: if one were to slaughter it, it would become permitted as food – and this permission removes the prohibition of muktzeh.
<br />
<br />
But why would it be muktzeh? We know that a calf born on a Yom Tov can definitely be eaten, so what is the difference between it and an egg? – The answer would be that the calf was permitted even while inside its mother – if one slaughtered the mother. This logic obviously does not apply to the chick.
<br />
<br />
There is also the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov, who says that the chick is prohibited even on a weekday – all the time that it has not opened its eyes. This is because, before this time, it is not properly a bird but a creepy-crawly and is prohibited together with other “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3037">things that creep upon the earth</a>.”<br />

Beitzah 7 – A hen and an egg

<br />
<br />
What practical lesson does this teach? The following: if one checked a coup before the Holiday (Yom Tov) and there were no eggs, and then he checked early in the morning and found an egg, he can eat that egg because he can be assured that the hen laid it during the day – just that he missed it. But what if he checked really well? - Perhaps the egg came out only partially and then returned – but it is still considered laid the day before the Holiday and is therefore permitted.
<br />
<br />
What about Rabbi Yose, who says that the egg in such a situation is forbidden? – Rabbi Yose is talking about the egg that was not fertilized by a rooster and which the hen laid by warming itself against the ground. But if the rooster is present – the hen will not do that and will wait for the rooster instead, so we can be sure that the egg is laid by day and consequently eat it.
<br />
<br />
How far can the rooster be? – Even sixty houses away, as long as the hen hears its crowing in the morning. However, if there is a river, the rooster will not cross, but he will if there is a bridge. But not a bridge made out of rope. And yet, there was an incident when the rooster crossed the river over the bridge made of rope.

Both questions deal with muktzeh - objects set aside from use, which should therefore not be used on Shabbat or Yom Tov.<br />
<br />
One can slaughter, cook, and eat animals on a Yom Tov, because although work, in general, is prohibited, preparing food is permitted. Furthermore, if one slaughters foul or wild animals, he needs to <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=17#P3246">cover their blood with earth</a>. However, digging earth on a Yom Tov is prohibited because it is akin to plowing or building, and in addition, the earth is muktzeh - set aside and not prepared for use on a Yom. Nevertheless, Beit Shammai permits one to dig with a spade and cover the blood with earth, whereas Beit Hillel requires the earth to be prepared on the previous day.<br />
<br />
But how can digging be allowed? - It turns out that there are limiting conditions: the spade has to be inserted into the ground on the previous day. But he is crumbling the clods of earth, which is akin to grinding? - We are talking about loose earth. And yet, why did Beit Shammai permit this outright, seeing that it is so close to violating Yom Tov and that Beit Hillel tell him not to? Because Beit Shammai did not want to withhold the joy of a Yom Tov from people since it is a mitzvah in itself.<br />

Beitzah 9 - A ladder

Beit Hillel disagrees and allows moving the ladder.
<br />
<br />
They must be talking about a ladder specifically designated for dovecotes, and yet Beit Shammai does not allow moving it. Why? - Because an onlooker might still think that he is going to plaster his roof. And Beit Hillel, what do they say? - That his ladder and his dovecote are proof enough of his intention. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Chanan further qualifies this disagreement: it is only a ladder in the street that they argue about, but if nobody sees him in the privacy of his home, then it should be allowed by everybody. But how can Rav Chanan say so? We know that there is a rule that "Whatever the Sages prohibited to do in public, because of what an onlooker might think, is equally prohibited inside his most private room!?" - It turns out that not everybody agrees to this rule, and Rav Chanan thus has his source. Furthermore, this rule only applies when it looks like he may be violating a Torah prohibition, but when an onlooker may think that he is violating a rule of the Sages - that is allowed in private.

When there is enough light to distinguish between the blue and the white wool (which is used in one's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzitzit">tzitzit</a>). Some say, he needs to distinguish between a wolf and a dog, and some – to recognize his friend from four steps away.&nbsp;When does the time to say the Shema end? Rabbi Eliezer says, at sunrise, since most people are up by then, but Rabbi Yehoshua says, “Three hours into the day, since kings do sleep that late.”<br />
<br />
People of refined character (“Vatikin”) would always say the Shema just before sunrise, so that they could then start their Amidah (prayer said while standing, or Eighteen Blessings) with the sunrise. “Vatikin” can also be translated as “devoted ones,” or “sharp, analytical individuals.” In that way, they could say the Shema at the right time, the Amidah at the ideal time, and moreover join the past redemption (Exodus, mentioned in the Shema) to the future redemption, mentioned in the Amida. Anyone who does this can expect that no harm will befall him that day.<br />
<br />
What if did not say the Shema at the best time, before sunrise? He can still say it until three hours into the day, says Rabbi Yehoshua, since it is the way of princes to wake up that late.<br />
<br />
Certain people in the neighborhoud of Rabbi Meir caused him considerable distress, and he wanted to pray that they should die. His wife Beruriah stopped him: “Does it say '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a4.htm">The sinners will be no more</a>'? - No! '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a4.htm">The sins should be no more</a>.' Pray that they should improve their ways!” He did, and they improved.

Brachot 11 – Lying Down to Say the Shema
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmXca-luzJl9kGj9fwiHlvofmv6GzzMyUOIPIISBpw6vAobzGI_S2TwWZuzurbllZYXP8FM6cd6AfRgNnQXZU0U_ZJjtipG2YC3-bfmmFHenoimMSX8jL53eEi-cO7pWJyGS8WRQLOWNBC/s1600/Paul+Cezanne+-+Boy+Resting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="263" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmXca-luzJl9kGj9fwiHlvofmv6GzzMyUOIPIISBpw6vAobzGI_S2TwWZuzurbllZYXP8FM6cd6AfRgNnQXZU0U_ZJjtipG2YC3-bfmmFHenoimMSX8jL53eEi-cO7pWJyGS8WRQLOWNBC/s320/Paul+Cezanne+-+Boy+Resting.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
Bait Shammai say that in the evening one must lie down in order to read the Shema, and in the morning he needs to be standing, since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5088">When you lie down and when you arise</a>.” &nbsp;However, Beit Hillel say that one can say the Shema in any position he finds himself, since the Torah also said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5088">While you go on the way</a>,” and that is neither lying down nor standing up. How does Beit Hillel explain “when you lie down and when you arise?” They say, it is talking about the time when people lie down and arise, not about the physical position. And Beit Shammai, how do they know the times to say the Shema? They answer, the Torah said, “When you lie down,” and not “when lying down” to tell us both the time and the position.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Tarfon said, “I was once on the road, and when the time for the evening Shema came, I lay down, to fulfill the words of Beit Shammai, and I almost came in danger because of the robbers.” His colleagues told him, “It would have been your own fault, for transgressing the words of Beit Hillel.”
<br />
<br />
The morning Shema is accompanied by two blessing before it and one after. These are thanks for giving the Torah and for help in studying it, as well as thanks and requests for God's help in all other areas. In parallel, the evening Shema has two blessings before and two blessings after it.<br />

Brachot 12 – The Prayers of the Kohanim 
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSNUt9MLdHpPos8X2LxT4cIqU7FzG8BEuLrN0mLXTOe-gcDcWNPNiHKMGWcJwFPoRJlJyvZHKDHa6H6wBY4J6OibYLUEaPW8ZPhygvGvlahuS5fWGEIlge4rSzA2b8HHg_rYxEGbG10YrN/s1600/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+Glass+of+Wine.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="177" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSNUt9MLdHpPos8X2LxT4cIqU7FzG8BEuLrN0mLXTOe-gcDcWNPNiHKMGWcJwFPoRJlJyvZHKDHa6H6wBY4J6OibYLUEaPW8ZPhygvGvlahuS5fWGEIlge4rSzA2b8HHg_rYxEGbG10YrN/s320/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+Glass+of+Wine.jpg" width="320" /></a>The Kohanim, the priests in the Temple, could say only those prayers which superseded their services. They therefore said one, not two, blessings before the Shema. Then they recited the ten commandments, and afterwards the Shema. Then they said the blessing after Shema, because it mentions trust in God. Out of the Amidah (Eighteen blessings) they said the prayer for the acceptance of their services, and then the three-part blessing for the people.
<br />
<br />
The Sages wanted to establish the reading of the Ten Commandments also outside the Temple, but soon abolished the idea, because it gave rise to the argument that only the Ten Commandments were true. 
<br />
<br />
On Shabbat, the Kohanim added another blessing, and the outgoing watch would say to the incoming watch: “The One who causes His Name to dwell in this House – may He cause among you: love, brotherhood, peace, and friendship.”
<br />
<br />
Every blessing should be said according the form that the Sages created for it. What if he started with one blessing in mind but ended with another? For example, he took a cup of beer and thought it was wine, and he started to say the blessing on the wine (which is more distinguished than that of beer), but then caught himself midway, and finished with the blessing on the beer? The Talmud tried to find an answer, but all examples are where even if he made a mistake, the blessing would still be valid, while in our case it would not be. Thus there is no definite proof, but for a simple answer – it is the conclusion of the blessing that counts.

However, it also mentions going out of Egypt, and for this reason Ben Zoma maitains that one should say it, even in the evening recitation of Shema, because the Torah required to “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=16#P5340">remember Exodus all the days of your life</a>.” “Days” means just that, days, but “all days” includes nights. However, the Sages say that it is not necessary to mentions Exodus at night. How do they explain the word “all?” – To include the Messianic era. Ben Zoma then questioned the Sages, “But the Exodus troubles will be forgotten in the Messianic time!?” The Sages answered him, “Not forgotten entirely, but only relegated to the second place, in view of the new miracles that will happen then.”
<br />
<br />
If one happened to be reading the “Shema” - “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5085">Listen, Israel</a>” in the Torah, at exactly the moment when the time to read this as a prayer arrived, does it count for him as prayer, or will he have to read it again? – That depends. If he had in mind, it counts, and if not, it does not. Does this mean in general that one has to be&nbsp;conscious&nbsp; of his doing a mitzvah, and only then it counts? – Not necessarily. Perhaps “having it in mind” does not mean “to fulfill his prayer obligation” but simply means that he is&nbsp;
conscious&nbsp;&nbsp;that he is saying the words. How can one not be&nbsp;
conscious&nbsp;&nbsp;if he is talking? – If he is reading the letters to verify the spelling in the Torah scroll.

Did he accept to refrain from eating and drinking – and he is not eating in this case? Or did he accept not to have any benefit from food, and there is a little benefit here? Rabbi Ami answered, “He can taste, and there is no problem in that.” From his reply we also understand that “in that” there is no problem, but he should not swallow, and no blessing is required. Some understand it differently and say that swallowing a small morsel is allowed.
<br />
<br />
If one greets a fellow before morning prayer, he is like praying to an idol. How could that be? We know that while reading the Shema prayer, one is allowed to interrupt, and initiate a greeting to another person, to show honor? – That is because this person chanced to come by, but the prohibition to greet others applies only when one goes out of his way to greet somebody before morning prayer, and he intends to derive some material benefit thereby.<br />

Rabbi Yochanan taught: “One who wishes to accept on himself Heaven's sovereignty in a complete manner, should relieve himself and wash his hands, don tefillin, then say the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a>, and the Amidah (Standing) prayer – and this is complete acceptance.”
<br />
<br />
If one said the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a>, but did not make it audible to his ears – this not the perfect way, but it counts. Rabbi Yose disagrees and says that he has not fulfilled his obligation and will have to repeat the Shema. What is the argument? Rabbi Yose says that the word “Shema” itself, which means “Hear” teaches that one should hear his words. And the first teacher (usually it is Rabbi Meir), what does he say? He says, “Shema,” or “Hear” means “Understand” and tells us that one can say the Shema in any language that he understands. And Rabbi Yose? He surelly agrees that one can say the Shema in any language!? – He says that the word “Shema” actually carries both lessons: that one must hear his words and that one can recite the Shema in any language that he understands.

If they started their work before the time to recite the morning Shema arrived, they are not required to descend, but can concentrate while saying the first phrase, and continue with the rest, where such extreme concentration is not required. However, they are not allowed do this with the Amidah (Standing prayer), since it requires long concentration, and they might be afraid to fall.
<br />
<br />
A groom is exempt from saying the Shema from the first night after his marriage (which was usually performed on Wednesday), and until after Shabbat – if he was not yet intimate with her. All this time he is too nervous to concentrate on saying the Shema, but after Shabbat he will be more at ease with his wife, and will be able to concentrate.
<br />
<br />
Rabban Gamliel married a woman, and nevertheless read the Shema the night after the wedding. His students asked, “Our teacher, you taught us that a groom is not obligated to say the Shema!?” He answered them, “I will not listen to you to stop myself from accepting the sovereignty of Heaven even for a moment.” Rabban Gamliel knew about himself that he can concentrate in Shema, and he was teaching them the law that in that case one is a allowed to pray.

He washed in hot water on the first night after his wife died. They asked him, “Our teacher, you taught us that a mourner is prohibited to wash!?” He answered, “I am not like other people, I am a delicate individual.” He was teaching that the Sages only prohibited a mourner to wash for pleasure, not if it was for health reasons. 
<br />
<br />
The word “delicate” is “istenis” in Hebrew. It has six letter, each hinting to one of the six reincarnated souls that were present in him, Abraham, Simon, Taviomi, Nachum, Yehuda, Sechorah. &nbsp;For their honor and rectification, he had to wash himself.<br />
<br />
When his servant Tavi died, he accepted condolences. His students asked, “Our teacher, you taught us not to accept condolences for slaves, but use a different way of expressing one's compassion, so that people will not mistakenly assume that the slave and his family were in fact free people, – which has implications for genealogy.” He told them, "Tabi was not like other people, he was a Torah Sage." This was a rare, unusual situation, and the regular decrees do not apply in exceptional cases.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud lists a number of special prayers and favorite moral lessons from various teachers. The common theme of them is that one should strive to become a better person, not just learn about it, and that a prayer, or moral lesson, needs to be repeated many times, in order to take effect.

Brachot 18 – When one's dead lies before him
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAH6yTSY7RT-CreKqFJmBnZ7eBfDY-adLOJi7Hv2KqnCAa7Ha6lkNO9DimMjCfhUt5N0rAkN-TUTRd6HLXuda29bAc70tpphoHISD2wqBvS3lIjivAdAyphpIbuGMLbS7u0DwgyrHxGQi_/s1600/Theodore+Gericault+-+Head+of+a+dead+young+man.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAH6yTSY7RT-CreKqFJmBnZ7eBfDY-adLOJi7Hv2KqnCAa7Ha6lkNO9DimMjCfhUt5N0rAkN-TUTRd6HLXuda29bAc70tpphoHISD2wqBvS3lIjivAdAyphpIbuGMLbS7u0DwgyrHxGQi_/s320/Theodore+Gericault+-+Head+of+a+dead+young+man.jpg" width="266" /></a>One whose dead relative lies before him is exempt from the Shema prayer, from the Amidah (Standing) prayer, from donning tefillin, and from all other mitzvot stated in the Torah – although he cannot violate any prohibitions. That is so, because he is preoccupied with the mitzvah of burial, just as a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-16-workers-and-bridegroom-say.html">bridegroom was preoccupied with the mitzvah of consummating the marriage</a>. This refers to his seven immediate relatives: mother, father, daughter, son, sister, brother, and spouse.
<br />
<br />
“Before him” is understood broadly: even if he is in a different house, burial is his obligation, and he therefore does not say Shema. So too is “One whose dead relative” – even if it is not his relative, but it is his obligation to bury him, he is exempt from mitzvot in his presence.
<br />
<br />
Even in the cemetery where other dead are buried, he should not wear his tzitzit, tefillin, or walk around with the Torah, since the phrase “He who mocks the pauper (that is, the dead, by showing them that he can do mitzvot and they can't) – he scorns His Maker.”
<br />
<br />
It once happened that Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yonathan were walking in a cemetery, and Rabbi Yonathan's tzitzit were dragging over the graves. Rabbi Chiya told him, “Lift them up, or else the dead will say, 'Tomorrow they are joining us here, and today they are mocking us!'” Rabbi Yonathan asked, “But do they know?” The Talmud goes into multiple proofs and disproof of whether the dead know what is going on in this world, with the tentative conclusion that they may know, because of their own high status, or because of the status of a live person who needs to communicate with them.

Brachot 19 – Honor of the Sages

Rabbi Elazar asked, him, “Where?” Rabbi Yehoshua answered, “Go and search.” Rabbi Elazar investigated and found only three such cases. Here is one:
<br />
<br />
Akavia ben Mahalalel held that the waters to remove suspicion of unfaithfulness cannot be given to an emancipated slavewoman. They told him, “But Shemayah and Avtalyon gave such a test to a former slavewoman called Charkemit!?” He answered, “It was the like” - meaning, they, too, did not have a pure genealogy, but descended from Sennacherib. On that, they excommunicated Akavia, and after he died, they symbolically put a stone on his coffin.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah comments, “God forbid that they excommunicated Akavia, who was the purest of Israel. Rather it was another person.” What about the story above? His comment “It was the like” means that they gave her water that looked like the water of purification, but in fact it was not.
<br />
<br />
Still, he found at most three cases, and not twenty-four, as Rabbi Yehoshua taught!? – Rabbi Yehoshua made conclusions from all comparable circumstances, and held that an excommunication happened in those situations also, and Rabbi Elazar was looking only for explicit mentions of it.

Brachot 2 - Saying the Shema Prayer (Blessings)
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjW4G_5QS4cUFbGlvXRHKaQKSU7JlikP-nmC5UtMDLAO_cBTwb2ZwwIgCpPf8DvEug4ktBlS0zpz42w81kjghYII-AJRi7RXbsZwOh2apQIHzs9f4gL9HpRaT69en3ofhp8UcSGEKLnyRet/s1600/Vincent+Van+Gogh+-+Four+Peasants+at+a+Meal.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="231" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjW4G_5QS4cUFbGlvXRHKaQKSU7JlikP-nmC5UtMDLAO_cBTwb2ZwwIgCpPf8DvEug4ktBlS0zpz42w81kjghYII-AJRi7RXbsZwOh2apQIHzs9f4gL9HpRaT69en3ofhp8UcSGEKLnyRet/s320/Vincent+Van+Gogh+-+Four+Peasants+at+a+Meal.jpg" width="320" /></a>Twice a day, evening and morning, one must say that he will listen to God and love God. This is the <i>Shema</i> prayer, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5085">Listen, Israel, God is our Lord, God is One.</a>"&nbsp;Since the Torah continues, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5088">when you lie down and when you get up</a>," we understand that this paragraph needs to be said twice.
<br />
<br />
However, the Shema is not said when one actually goes to sleep or wakes up, but rather in the general period when people lie down and get up. When is this? In the evening - when the Kohanim, who were impure, are returning from the mikveh to eat priestly portion (terumah), that is, at nightfall. That is when the time to say the Shema in the evening begins, but when does it end? Rabbi Eliezer said, "Until the end of the first watch, that is, the first part of the night." Rabbi Eliezer understands "when you lie down" to be the time when people go to sleep. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. We can understand Rabban Gamliel's 'when people lie down" means when people are asleep. However, the opinion of the Sages will require clarification.
<br />
<br />
Why did the teacher not simply state "nightfall" and instead talk about Kohanim coming home? - He wanted to teach an additional rule in passing, that the Kohanim can start eating their portion at night after immersion. That is true even if they had a severe impurity, such as that of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a>, and still need to bring a sacrifice - that offering does not prevent them from eating their kohen's portion.

Brachot 20 – Human Dignity vs Honor of God
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxZ1yzGhETm94czXip4xmIyABtYri-XfaEipK6fJ5NGgyZsIzUQOaN1KjjOO8j56YLtanxZpHOSEKerKdbT1S5R2gsVPuZhboD0zn6jR7tmNnWWMGvLxyTX345DbzIp04bNuuqxm1cfk8v/s1600/Paul+Mathey+-+Woman+&amp;+Child+in+an+Interior.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxZ1yzGhETm94czXip4xmIyABtYri-XfaEipK6fJ5NGgyZsIzUQOaN1KjjOO8j56YLtanxZpHOSEKerKdbT1S5R2gsVPuZhboD0zn6jR7tmNnWWMGvLxyTX345DbzIp04bNuuqxm1cfk8v/s320/Paul+Mathey+-+Woman+&amp;+Child+in+an+Interior.jpg" width="259" /></a>Rav said: “If one was standing in the street and discovered that his garments had in them “shatnez,” a forbidden mixture of wool and linen, he needs to takes them off right there, and disregard his honor.” What is Rav's source? – Proverbs, which say, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2821.htm">There is no value to wisdom or understanding against the honor of God</a>.” That is, in order not to transgress, one can disregard the honor due his teacher or himself.
<br />
<br />
But we learned that when accompanying a mourner, even a Kohen can go through a cemetery, to give mourner the comfort or to honor him!? – This refers to plowed-over cemetery, where there is only a suspicion of impurity, and the Sages therefore allowed him to go, but he would not be allowed to actually transgress the Torah.
<br />
<br />
But we learned that one does not have to return a lost object if the object is beneath his dignity!? So one can eschew a mitzvah if it would dishonor him!? – No, that is only because the Torah itself allowed it, by saying, “Hide? - No, you cannot hide from a lost object,” and the first word “Hide” allows one to disregard this mitzvah in special cases, but it would not apply generally. And it is due to the earlier generations' being ready to disregard their honor that miracles would happen for them.
<br />
<br />
Some groups of people are not required to say the Shema prayer, for example, a woman, because she may be busy at the right time, and a young child, who is anyway not obligated in mitzvot and whose father may not be home to remind him.

Brachot 21 – Extra Purity for Shema

After he had a seminal emission, he was required to immerse in a mikveh, and immediately after that, he would be considered pure and fit to pray and study. The Sages derived this from the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5012">Just as on the day when you stood before your God on Horeb</a>,” that is, just as for receiving the Torah, men had to separate from their wives prior to that, so later, they had to purify themselves before studying or reciting the Torah. Therefore, the rule reads: one who had a seminal emission thinks the words of Shema in his mind, and as far as the blessings before and after it – he does not say them at all.
<br />
<br />
Do we see from here that thoughts are the same as speech? – No, for if they were, he could say the words, and not just think them. Then, if the words are not as speech, why is he thinking them, since it does not give him the mitzvah of saying the Shema anyway? – So that he would be involved with the same subject as the congregation.

Brachot 22 – Words of Torah do not Become Impure

<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-21-extra-purity-for-shema.html">discussion about the “immersion of Ezra”</a> continued both in the time of the Mishnah and in the time of the Talmud. Who was it for, for a healthy person or even for a somewhat weak one? Was it for the one who had accidental emission, or also for one who experienced it at will, as a result of his marital relations? Also, the nine kavin vessel above, who was that for? – which combination of the factors allowed or even required it?<br />
<br />
Finally, even though some individuals continued to practice it, the custom has become not to require the additional purification in the mikveh, following the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira. Here is how we know it. One student (who had an emission) was reciting Torah teachings in front of Rabbi Yehudah and was stammering. Rabbi Yehudah told him, “My son! Open your mouth and let your words shine forth!” As Jeremeiah said, “Behold, My words are like fire, says God.” Just as fire cannot contract impurity, so words of Torah cannot contract impurity.

Brachot 23 – Attending to one's needs

This rule goes back to the time before the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-22-words-of-torah-do-not-become.html">lenient opinion of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira</a> was accepted.
<br />
<br />
If one who had an emission went to a mikveh just before the ideal time to say the Shema – sunrise – &nbsp;then if he is able to get out of the water, cover himself, and recite the Shema – he should do it. However, if the time passes, he should “cover himself with water,” that is, stand with only his head above the water, and say Shema that way. But we know that the one is allowed to say the morning Shema much later, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-10-prayer-of-refined.html">until the three hours into the day</a>, why is he rushing? – He decided to do the “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-10-prayer-of-refined.html">prayer of the refined</a>” today, and that gives him the right to rush.
<br />
<br />
Since people used to wear tefillin all day, what is the proper way to go to a latrine in them? Initially, they would put the tefillin in a window of the latrine, facing the street, and that is the opinion of Beit Shammai. However, people were stealing them, and once a prostitute took a student's tefillin and brought them to the study hall, claiming that it was her reward from him. After that, Beit Hillel allowed to roll the tefillin and take them with oneself to the latrine, holding them in the right hand. Rabbi Yochanan took it a step further: if he had a scroll in his hand, he would leave it with his students, but he would take the tefillin into a latrine, saying that once the Sages allowed it, the tefillin will protect him there.

Brachot 24 – Saying Shema in the presence of nakedness

Some say that it is permitted, and even when the other person is his wife. Others say that, just the opposite, only with his wife it is permitted, because he and his wife are considered as one flesh, but with others it would not be allowed.
<br />
<br />
However, one should not say the Shema while looking at any part of a woman's body that is normally covered, and now happens to be uncovered. When does this apply? It goes without saying that one cannot enjoy a woman's beauty if she is not his wife, and looking at any part of her for his gratification is forbidden. This applies, however, to saying Shema while looking at his wife, looking at her hair, or listening to her singing.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chanina said, “I saw that during his Standing prayer Rabbi Yehudah the Prince belched,  yawned, sneezed, and spat upon the ground.” How was he allowed to do this? – Belching and yawning are indeed allowed if done involuntarily, provided that when yawning one covers his mouth. Sneezing – if it is a euphemism for passing wind, then indeed it is not allowed, but sneezing with one's nose is actually a good sign: just as he got relief in this world, so he will get relief in the next one. Spitting is allowed if it bothers him and he does not have napkin, and even then, he should spit to the back of himself, and pause after it.

Rav Chisda answered him, “My God! Even if Rabbi Yochanan himself told me this, I would not listen to him.” Rather he should pause. If he did not, the verse from Ezekiel applies to him, “I (God) too gave you decrees that were not good” - since he denied the goodness contained in Shema. If he did stop, however, his reward is in the verse “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=32#P5800">And with this matter (or speech) shall you prolong your days</a>.”<br />
<br />
If one's hand is resting in the airspace of a latrine, can he say the Shema then? Rav Huna says that he is permitted, relying on the verse in the psalms, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26f0.htm">All that breathe shall praise God</a>” – that is, only the position of his nose and mouth matters. However Rav Chisda forbids it, based on a different verse, “All my limbs shall exclaim, '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2635.htm">God, who is like You!</a>'”<br />

But didn't we say that the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-10-prayer-of-refined.html">proper time for morning prayer is at sunrise</a>? – True, this refers to the prayer of the refined ones. But did not Rabbi Yochanan say that one can pray all day? – That is also true, but in that case one only gets the reward for prayer, while the reward for “timely prayer” is not given to him.
<br />
<br />
What if one missed a prayer? – He can say it two times in the next time period, such as if he missed a morning prayer, he can say the afternoon prayer two times. Some even say that any number of missed prayers can be restored in this way. But King Solomon said, “Twisted cannot be made straight” - about a one who missed Shema or Standing prayer!? – This refers to one who did it on purpose.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose says that prayers were established by Abraham (morning), Isaac (afternoon), and Jacob (evening), while Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says that the Sages established them based on the sacrifices in the Temple. The precise timings of the prayers seem to indicate that they were modeled after sacrifices. What does Rabbi Yose have to answer? – That they were established by the Patriarchs, and the later Sages added timings based on the sacrifices.

Brachot 27 – When the sun grew hot, the manna would melt

They disagree about when does morning end. In view of their positions, who could have authored the following rule (remember, we don't want to introduce a third view unless absolutely necessary). 
<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1969">When the sun grew hot, the manna would melt</a>.” – and that is the fourth hour! Now, you say it is the forth hour, but may not, maybe it is midday?! – No, midday is called “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=18#P426">The heat of the day</a>.” So who is the author? Not Rabbi Yehudah, who considers all four hours as morning, and surely not the Sages, who consider all six hours morning!? If you want, I can tell you that this rule agrees with the Sages, and if you want – with Rabbi Yehudah. How so? With the Sages: since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1969">Morning, every morning</a>,” it really meant the first part of the morning, that is, three hours, just as we said. Or with Rabbi Yehudah: “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1969">Morning, every morning</a>” means one hour before the end of morning, that is, one hour before four, which is three.

Brachot 28 – That day

Rabban Gamliel felt that his uncontested authority as a leader was essential to this, and he enforced it by various means. 
<br />
<br />
One of the disagreements was whether the evening prayer was obligatory or voluntary. A particular student posed this question to both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabban Gamliel. Since they gave different answers, Rabban Gamliel forced Rabbi Yehoshua to stand on his feet all day. Since it was the third time Rabban Gamliel acted this way, the Sages did not like it and removed him and nominated Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria instead.<br />
<br />
On that day, many previously unresolved laws were decided through the testimony of various previously unaccepted Sages. They added four hundred benches for students (some say seven hundred) because Rabban Gamliel used to have stringent moral requirements for admittance to the Academy. On seeing this, he became distressed that he withheld Torah from the sons of Israel. They showed him in a dream white ovens with ashes, hinting that the new students were empty inside. However, it was not true – in Heaven, they just wanted to cheer up Rabban Gamliel. 
<br />
<br />
The demoted Rabban Gamliel never absented himself from the Academy and participated in discussions as an equal. Ultimately, he appeased Rabbi Yehoshua, and the Sages, unwilling to lower Rabbi Elazar, reinstated Rabban Gamliel to lead for three weeks and Rabbi Elazar for one week.

Brachot 29 – Eighteen blessings
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtBu0YFWxPZeXsBCAV0ayHDI1PcaXgwShc9o5QLqKqExJauGmogmFPQL7wXg5m5ckSJoyvo_zZzklhG9dS3z5FPe4mZ5aqpsLd5nFuvdDcCWLR_KPMjAWirJ3fN92ludFbbJYROKBKM3S3/s1600/Albert+Anker+-+Boy+Writing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtBu0YFWxPZeXsBCAV0ayHDI1PcaXgwShc9o5QLqKqExJauGmogmFPQL7wXg5m5ckSJoyvo_zZzklhG9dS3z5FPe4mZ5aqpsLd5nFuvdDcCWLR_KPMjAWirJ3fN92ludFbbJYROKBKM3S3/s320/Albert+Anker+-+Boy+Writing.jpg" width="224" /></a>Initially the written Torah was not allowed to be recited from memory, and the oral laws were not to be committed to writing. However, it was always known that eventually the phrase “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26b9.htm">The time has come to act for God</a>” would allow to write down the prayers, for example, and this did happen in the time of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince.
<br />
<br />
When the prayers could only be recited by heart, Rabban Gamliel held that one should say the complete eighteen blessings of the Standing (Amidah) prayer every day, Rabbi Yehoshua – that one has to say the abridged prayer, and Rabbi Akiva – that it depends on one's proficiency. Even now, when one is in danger and is unable to concentrate, he can say the short prayer of Rabbi Yehoshua.
<br />
<br />
Why are there precisely eighteen blessings? – This corresponds to the eighteen praises of God in the <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2629.htm">psalm of David</a>, some say, to the eighteen mentions of God in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a>, and others – to the eighteen vertebrae in the spine, which bends in prayer. Later, another blessing, directed against the persecutors of the Jews, was inserted, but the prayer retained it name, "Eighteen blessings." But the number eighteen had a basis! There is yet another name of God in this psalm, another name (“One”) in Shema, and another small vertebra.
<br />
<br />
If one makes his prayer a fixed obligation, it is not acceptable, that is, the prayer should not be a burden to him; some say, it should not be said at a fixed time of the day, but rather with the sunrise and sunset; others say – it should always be a supplication.

Why did he use this expression? He wanted to tell us that there are "watches in heaven” and “watches on earth,” that is, there are spiritual changes during the night, reflected in propitious prayer and study times. At each and every watch, the Holy One Blessed Be He sits and roars like a lion, as Jeremiah has said, “God will roar from on high... He will roar and roar over his lodging.” 
<br />
<br />
At the first watch, a donkey brays, at the second – dogs howl, at the third – and infant nurses from his mother's breasts, and a woman talks to her husband. But why do we need these signs? We know when it is morning anyway? – If one is sleeping in a dark house, once a woman begins speaking with her husband – let him arise and say the Shema.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose told a story. I once traveled on the road and entered a ruin of Jerusalem to pray. Elijah came and waited for me at the entrance. When I finished my prayer, he told me, “You should have prayed on the road.” I learned then that one should not enter a ruin but pray a short prayer while on the road. He then asked, “What did you hear, my son?” I told him, “I heard a Heavenly voice that was cooing like a dove and saying, 'Woe to the sons because of whose sins I destroyed My house, burned my Temple, and exiled them among the nations of the world.'” Elijah told me, “God says this not once but three times every day. And when the people enter synagogues and houses of study, the Holy One Blessed Be He shakes His head and says, 'Fortunate is the King who is praised in His house thus, what is there for the Father who exiled His sons, and woe to the sons who have been exiled from the Father's table.”

Brachot 30 – One Who hears prayer

What is its text? Rabbi Yehoshua says, “Save, O God, Your nation, the remnant of Israel; at every cross-roads (meaning, even if they are crossing You) may their needs be before You. Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer.” Rabbi Eliezer says, “Grant peace of mind to those who fear You; do to them what's right in Your eyes (but don't punish them through others, more than needed). Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer.” Others say, “The needs of Your nation Israel are many, but their minds are limited to express them; may it be Your will to give to everyone enough for his sustenance. Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer.”
<br />
<br />
If one is traveling on a donkey, and the time for Standing prayer comes, he should dismount and pray. If he cannot dismount either because of company or because there is nobody to hold the donkey, he can pray while riding, and he should turn his face towards Israel, and in Israel – towards Jerusalem, and imagine himself in the Holy of Holies. 
<br />
<br />
On Shabbat, they would bring a special additional sacrifice, and correspondingly, there is an additional prayer on Shabbat, called Musaf (additional). Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that it should only be said in a congregation, but the Sages says that everybody needs to recite it. Rabbi Yehudah says that if there is a congregation in his town, he can rely on them, but if not, he needs to say it himself.

The early pious ones would meditate for a complete hour before Amidah, to direct their minds to their Father in Heaven.
<br />
<br />
What is the source of this rule? – We can learn it from Hannah , who was “exceptionally bitter at heart.” (Book of Samuel)? – No, that cannot be the source, perhaps Hannah had more problems than normal. Rather it is from the psalm: “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2605.htm">As for me... I will prostrate myself in awe of You</a>.” – No, that can't be the source either, maybe King David is trying to be exceptionally righteous. Rather, it is from here, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2602.htm">Serve God with awe and rejoice with trepidation</a>.”<br />
<br />
What does “rejoice with trepidation” mean? – That one should not loose the awareness of God even in supreme joy. Abaye was sitting and learning before Rabbah, and Rabbah noticed that Abaye was excessively cheerful. He said to Abaye, “Rejoice with trepidation!?” – Abaye answered, “I am wearing tefillin.” Some say that Abbaye was joyful to finally be able to fulfill this mitzvah, and others – that tefillin themselves have a spiritual effect on a person.
<br />
<br />
Mar the son of Ravina made a wedding feast for his son, and he observed that the rabbis were excessively cheerful. He brought a precious glass cup worth four hundred zuz and broke it in front of them, and they were saddened.

Brachot 32 – Flinging words upward toward Heaven

She said (in the book of Samuel), “Give me a child! If You do not, I will hide myself with another man and cause my husband Elkanah to become jealous of me and to warn against that man. I will then hide with him again, be tested with bitter waters, and, since I will be innocent, You will be forced to fulfill the words of Your Torah, '<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=5#P3818">then she shall be proven innocent and she shall bear seed</a>.'”<br />
<br />
Elijah also spoke without proper respect, when he said, “You have turned their hearts backwards.” In other words, he said that it was within God's power to make his people behave correctly. Actually, generations later God agreed to Elijah, when He told the prophet Micah, “...one whom I (God) caused to be evil.”
<br />
<br />
In fact, it is within God power to stop people from acting badly, and thus they always have this defense.  As Rabbi Chama expressed it, “If not for the following three verses, the feet of the enemies of Israel would falter.” By the “enemies of Israel” he meant the Jews themselves. The first is the verse above, “whom I caused to be evil.” The second is in Jeremiah, “Behold, as clay in the hands of the potter, so are you in My hand, O House of Israel.” The third one is in Ezekiel, “And I (God) will remove the stone hearts from you and give you feeling hearts of flesh.”

Brachot 33 – Incidents while praying

That, however, is only true of a Jewish king, who is cognizant of the law, but not answering to a non-Jewish king may be dangerous, and there one should return the greeting.
<br />
<br />
It once happened that a pious man was praying while on the road, and a Roman general greeted him, but he did not return the greeting. The general waited until he finished his prayer, and then asked, “It says in your Torah, '<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5011">watch yourself</a>' &nbsp;and '<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5017">watch your souls greatly</a>' By not answering you violated your own Torah and put yourself in danger. I could have cut your head off with my sword!” The pious man explained, “If you were standing in front of a king and someone greeted you, would you answer?” The general said, “No!” The pious man concluded, “How much more so for me, who was standing in front of the King of Kings!”
<br />
<br />
Even if a snake coiled around his heel, he should not interrupt his prayer. That is true, however, only of a snake that is not likely to bite. There was once a creature called “arod,” a mixture of a snake and a lizard, who was hurting people. They told Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa about it, and he came and put his heel over its burrow. The arod bit Rabbi Chanina and died. At this time they said, “Woe to a man who meets an arod, but woe to an arod who meets Rabbi Chanina.” Rabbi Chanina then put the dead arod on his shoulders and brought it to school, saying, “It's not the arod that kills, but it's the person's imperfections that do.” 
<br />
<br />
After Shabbat, one says “Blessed is the One who made a difference between Shabbat and weekday” in the blessing asking for wisdom. Wisdom is the first request in prayer, since without it nothing else is possible.

Some say, because he creates envy between birds and other creatures, but some say this is because he thinks that he explained God's actions as based on mercy, whereas in reality it is not mercy that dictates God's actions, but it is God's actions that define what mercy is. 
<br />
<br />
Likewise, if he says, “We thank You, we thank You” in his prayer, they silence him, since it seems that he prays to two different powers. So too, if he says, “For the goodness that you accomplish on our behalf may Your name be remembered” - that is also wrong, since a man needs to bless God for bad in the same way that he blesses Him for good. Likewise, if he says “The good ones shall bless you,” that is also wrong, since the bad ones should be included in the communal prayer together with the good ones.
<br />
<br />
If one prayed and erred, it is a bad sign for him, and if he is a prayer leader, it is a bad sign for the congregation. However, that is true only if he erred in the first three blessings of praise. Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa would pray for people and then say, “This one will live, and this one will die.” They asked him, “How do you know, are you a prophet?” He answered them, “No, but if my prayer flows smoothly on my lips, then I know that it is accepted, and if not, then it is torn up.

Brachot 35 – Why say a blessing?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsbV9-UznLLEM3ysrARR6KI2qK9egsNigT8te2kbVDBcEFVg23aRqWUoJfAr43xKv8eIplQLNjHKgwXPxBpem5NzVUx5tGShYO6KognuywUyFR0ZHzoB4-fs5fCQhifNMg3NRwiYI8bCkq/s1600/Cornelis+De+Heem+-+Still+life+with+wine+and+grapes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsbV9-UznLLEM3ysrARR6KI2qK9egsNigT8te2kbVDBcEFVg23aRqWUoJfAr43xKv8eIplQLNjHKgwXPxBpem5NzVUx5tGShYO6KognuywUyFR0ZHzoB4-fs5fCQhifNMg3NRwiYI8bCkq/s320/Cornelis+De+Heem+-+Still+life+with+wine+and+grapes.jpg" width="251" /></a>Before eating the fruits of the tree, one must say “Blessed is the One Who creates the fruit of the tree.” Why? – In describing the fourth year of a tree, the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=19#P3303">Holy for praises to God</a>.” &nbsp;We thus see that one must say two praises to God, before food and after. But this phrase is used to teach the basic law of the fourth year!? True, so we can learn only one blessing from this phrase, said after eating, and derive the other one through logic: if he blesses when he is satisfied, surely he must bless when he is hungry!
<br />
<br />
But maybe the reason for saying blessings on grapes and wine is because they are brought on the Altar? And even if you say that the main factor is that they satisfy, what about meat, eggs, and fish, which are not even planted, like the vine?! Rather, the blessing is dictated by logic: a person should view the world around him as sacred, so that he is not permitted to derive benefit from it before he says a blessing.
<br />
<br />
Should one only study Torah, or should one also work for sustenance? In the school of Rabbi Ishmael they taught that since the Torah says both “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0601.htm">This book of Torah shall never depart from your mouth</a>” and “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=11#P5217">you will gather in your grain</a>,” then one should do both. However, Rabbi Shimon asked, “If he sows and harvests and processes the grain, when does he study?” – rather, one should dedicate himself completely to Torah. Many followed Rabbi Ishmael and succeeded, tried to follow Rabbi Shimon, and did not succeed.

Brachot 36 – The special blessing for wine

On olive oil, for example, one does not say a special blessing, but rather the same blessing as on the olive itself?! This is because wine gladdens the heart. If wine is so important, let's give it a complete Grace after meals, just like one says after bread! – No, people's meal centers around bread, but it does not centers around wine. Rav Nachman asked Rava, “What if one made wine the center of his meal, does he say a complete Grace afterwards?” Rava answered: “When Elijah comes, he will answer you, but for now, since most people don't consider wine a bone-fide meal, his intention is unimportant compared to the majority.”
<br />
<br />
What is a proper blessing on palm shoots (the new growth, which is  soft and edible)? Rav Yehudah says that since right now it is fruit, it deserves the blessing of “Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the ground.” However, Shmuel, his teacher, says that since eventually it will harden and become bark, then even now it has the regular blessing of any food, “Blessed is the One Who created everything by His word.” Shmuel then praised his favorite student, saying “Sharp one! You position is more reasonable, since on radishes, although they eventually harden, people say the blessing of the fruit of the ground.” But even though Shmuel praised his student, the law does not follow his student. Why not? Radishes are planted with the intention to eat them soft, even though they will harden. Palms, however, are not planted for eating their shoots.<br />

Brachot 37 – Blessing for pepper

How could they argue, peppercorns are a great food!? – They are talking about dried-out peppercorns. Rav Sheshet says that since dried peppercorns are worse than the original ones, they loose their blessing of “Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the earth” and get a generic blessing instead. Rava, however, does not consider them food altogether. This is in fact consistent with Rava's point of view, since he said that one who chews and swallows peppercorn and ginger on Yom Kippur is exempt.
<br />
<br />
Still, how could Rava say this? It contradicts the earlier, more authoritative teaching of Rabbi Meir, who asked, why did the Torah have to say “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=19#P3302">food tree</a>” when talking about the laws of trees in Israel? – To include trees whose wood and fruit taste the same, and what is it? - Pepper! Parenthetically, it tells you that the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=8#P5141">Land of Israel lacks nothing</a>. So pepper is edible!? – Rava was talking about dried pepper, and Rabbi Meir – about fresh one.
<br />
<br />
But again, how could Rava exempt eating ginger on Yom Kippur? Did he not state that the cooked paste of ginger and honey imported from India is kosher, is not forbidden because a non-Jew cooked it, that there is no concern  that it has absorbed the non-kosher flavors when cooked in the Hindu's utensils, and that one says a blessing “Who created the fruit of the earth” on it! – True, but on Yom Kippur Rava exempted only dried peppers.

What is their argument? All agree that “motzi” means “Who brings forth,” and that it works. However, the Sages say that even “ha-motzi” also means that, whereas Rabbi Nechemyah says that it refers only to the future, as in “God, Who brings them forth from Egypt” – and that promise was given when the Exodus was only in the future.
<br />
<br />
The students praised the son of Rav Zevid to their teacher, Rabbi Zeira, saying that he is an expert in blessing. When he was invited to a meal with Rabbi Zeira, he said the blessing on bread using “motzi.” Rabbi Zeira was upset, saying, “Is that your great expert? He should have said 'ha-motzi,' to teach us the meaning of this word, and to tell us that the law is like the Sages!" And what did the “expert” think? – He chose a form acceptable to all, in order not go into a dispute.
<br />
<br />
On vegetables one says “Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the earth.” Since this law is taught right after the law of bread, we understand that it refers to cooked vegetables as well. However, others say that cooked vegetables loose their special blessing and get the generic blessing on food, “Blessed is the One by Whose word everything was created”. Rav Chisda reconciles the two sides: if the vegetable is usually eaten raw and not cooked, then it looses its special blessing. However, if it is usually eaten cooked but not raw, then the raw vegetables gets a generic blessing, and the cooked one - “Who created the fruit of the earth.” What is an example of the first? – Garlic.

Brachot 39 – A whole loaf or slices of better quality

They brought before them cooked cabbage and partridge meat. Bar Kappara gave permission to one of the to say the blessing; the student rushed and said the blessing on the partridge, and his colleague mocked him. Bar Kappara became angry and said, “I am not angry with the one who said the blessing, but with the one who mocked. If you friend looks like one who never tasted meat in his life, is that a reason to mock?” Then he said, “I am not angry with the one who mocked, but with the one who wrongly recited the blessing. Even if I am not wise, at least I am older, and he should have asked.” Both students did not live out the year.
<br />
<br />
What was their argument? Could it be that one thought that cooked cabbage looses its special blessing, and then meat takes precedence, while one who mocked held that cabbage keeps its special blessing, and should be blessed first? – No, both held that the cabbage looses its special blessing, only one thought you bless the item you like more, and the other – that you bless the one that's healthier.
<br />
<br />
If one had in front of him a whole loaf of bread and slices of better quality, which is preferable for saying a blessing? Rabbi Yochanan says that it is the whole one, and Rav Huna – that it is a better quality slice. Although the law in this follows Rabbi Yochanan, if one can eat from both and make peace between Rabbi Yochanan and Rav Huna – so much the better.

However, David's real schedule was as follows: during the first part of the night he would sleep like a horse, whose sleep is always light – that is, he would study Torah with occasional catnaps, and since midnight he arose strong as a lion, to sing praises. For that, David had a harp near his bed, and at midnight the northern wind would come and play on it, to wake him up.
<br />
<br />
David praised himself, “Guard my soul, for I am devout.” He meant, “All the kings of East and West sleep until three hours into the day, but I arise at midnight, to give thanks to You.” Some say, he meant, “All kings sit with honorable advisors, and my hands are soiled with blood, looking at the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">niddah</a> stains, embryos, and afterbirths, to declare a woman pure for her husband. Not only that, but I will agree if my decision is incorrect.”
<br />
<br />
The Sages <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">required saying the Shema before midnight</a>.&nbsp;Why? This is later than people going to bed, but earlier than the sleep ends! – They wanted to distance a man from an error, lest he comes home and decides to eat a little and sleep a little, and then miss the evening Shema, and anybody who transgresses the words of the Sages deserves to be bitten by a snake. Why suddenly so strong a statement? Because of the danger of sleep.

Brachot 40 – Serving bread
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

In general, one should eat the bread right after he said the blessing on it. However, if he interrupts for the needs of the meal, this is considered a necessity, and later he can eat without saying the blessing again. For example, Rav, having broken off a piece, would give pieces to his guests, saying to each “Please take a piece of this bread which has been blessed.” Rabbi Yochanan added that if he says, “Bring the salt, please” or “Bring the relish,” this is also a necesssity, and not an interrupttion. Rav Sheshet said that even if he says, “Knead food for oxen,” that, too, is not an interruption, because one is a supposed to feed his animals before he eats himself, as the Torah said in Shema, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=11#P5218">And I will give grass for your animals... and you will eat and be satisfied</a>.”<br />
<br />
If one took a fruit and, instead of the proper blessing of “Blessed is the One Who created a fruit of a tree” said the blessing on vegetables, “Who created the fruit of the ground,” he has fullfilled his obligation to bless before eating, since, after all, fruit do grow from the ground. The other way around is not true, since vegetables do not grow on trees. If he said a generic blessing “Blessed is the One by Whose word everything was created” on any food, he has also fulfilled his obligation, because his words are true. Nevertheless, one should learn the proper blessing for each food, and in this way he will praise God better.<br />

Rabbi Yehudah says that for anything like that, which is a sort of curse, there is not blessing at all. And the Sages? – They say that after all he who ate them derived some benefit.
<br />
<br />
If one had in front of him many species of foods, and some of them were of the seven species for which the Land of Israel is especially praised, then Rabbi Yehudah say that he he should bless and eat these first. However, the Sages say that he blesses that one which he personally likes most. 
<br />
<br />
The seven species are mentioned in this Torah phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=8#P5140">It is a land of wheat, barley, grapes, figs and pomegranates - a land of oil-olives and honey-[dates]</a>.” Moreover, this phrase dictates the order of preference between the seven species themselves. However, Rav Chanan uses this phrase for a different conclusion, namely, that each of the fruit is used in some law in the Torah as a measurement. For example, wheat: if one goes into a house afflicted with tzaraat (spiritual leprosy), his garments become ritually impure only if he spends there “enough time to eat half a loaf of wheat bread.” Barley: a human bone the size of a barley kernel imparts spiritual impurity of the dead, but not if it is less than that. Vine – a measure of it is prohibited to a nazirite. Figs – by carrying as much as a volume of a dried fig one transgresses Shabbat, and so on.

Rav Pappa visited the house of Rav Huna, and after they finished their meal, something else was brought to Rav Pappa, and he started eating. The students asked him, “One who finishes eating is not allowed to eat anymore!?” He answered that they were misquating the rule, it's “One who completes the meal and does not intend to eat anymore.” Rava and Rabbi Zeira were eating at the house of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exilarch">Exilarch</a>. After the servants removed each guest's individual tray, the Exilarch sent them more food, but Rabbi Zeira did not eat it. Rava told him, “You may think that you are finished, but being guests, we rely on the Exilarch to end the meal.”
<br />
<br />
In the early days, they would start the festival meal with wine and desserts, then continue with the meal,  also accompanied by wine, and then again serve more wine with desserts after the meal has ended. One who said a blessing on the wine before the meal would also include the after-meal wine in this blessing, because these two went together. However, he did not include the wine that came during the meal, because that wine had a different purpose – it came for the food courses in the meal.

Brachot 43 – Eating in a company
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcjVWCqByZ-epcNA0Y8BzGfi5TdW2wo6AeKhRISqUXV6pii871mnjL3LEHrMFXVjFbegDxPZ7l3dKrax73TbHZNx1THeeS2sUBq5e-Fo1eZrPxLzK6H1ZAjbUhaTeCUxP6OfQbb3hkPLVc/s1600/Jan+Steen+-+The+Meal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcjVWCqByZ-epcNA0Y8BzGfi5TdW2wo6AeKhRISqUXV6pii871mnjL3LEHrMFXVjFbegDxPZ7l3dKrax73TbHZNx1THeeS2sUBq5e-Fo1eZrPxLzK6H1ZAjbUhaTeCUxP6OfQbb3hkPLVc/s320/Jan+Steen+-+The+Meal.jpg" width="268" /></a>At a common meal, when people are eating as a company, one should recite the blessing for food for all present, and then they can all eat. However, if they are not eating as a group, then each one should recite his own blessing. What is a sign that they are eating together? – When they are sitting together at a table, but not, for example, when they are standing. Another case of eating in a company is when they say, “Let's go an eat at such-and-such place.”
<br />
<br />
When Rav dies, his students accompanied him to the cemetery. On the way back, they said, “Let's go and have a meal on the bank of the Danak River.” After they have eaten, without quite sitting down, they did not know if they ate as a group. Rav Ada bar Ahavah stood up, turned his garment front-to-back, and tore an additional tear on it, as a sign of further mourning. He said, “Rav just died, and we already forgot the laws of the meal!” Finally a certain old man came and taught them the above rules, that even if they said “Let's go eat at a certain place,” they are already considered a company.
<br />
<br />
After the meal they would bring burning fragrances, and the one who said the blessing on the wine would also say them on the fragrances. What is the source of the blessing on fragrances? This is the last phrase in the psalms, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26f0.htm">Let every breathing soul praise God</a>.” What is it that only the person's souls, but not his body, derives please from? – These are pleasantly smelling fragrances.

Brachot 44 – The fruit of Kinneret
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJtVPPJY2H75FpUOxwYWVVjmVHiOSwHrZQk-XBJxJDiHrQmEbDdt023o4qnbW3kEwCTSfNeji1CoWIfYe0gt_SHyeFd3Vvqw4QfcfoXsOKcHOtm59n-j86j_Z_nVVUMn5vNS4nQ2yhQC3w/s1600/Claude+Oscar+Monet+-+Fruit+Basket+With+Apples+And+Grapes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJtVPPJY2H75FpUOxwYWVVjmVHiOSwHrZQk-XBJxJDiHrQmEbDdt023o4qnbW3kEwCTSfNeji1CoWIfYe0gt_SHyeFd3Vvqw4QfcfoXsOKcHOtm59n-j86j_Z_nVVUMn5vNS4nQ2yhQC3w/s320/Claude+Oscar+Monet+-+Fruit+Basket+With+Apples+And+Grapes.jpg" width="320" /></a>If they brought him a salted food, and with it – bread, then he says the blessing on the salted food, and bread is included. That is the rule: any time you have a primary food and another one accompanying it, you say the blessing on the primary food, and it suffices for the accompanying one.
<br />
<br />
How could this be true? How could the importance of bread be reduced to secondary food? – This is talking about the fruit in the area of Kinneret called Genosar. These fruit were so exceptionally sweet that they needed salt, and compared to them, bread was secondary.
<br />
<br />
Rabbah bar bar Chanah related that when Rabbi Yochanan and his students went there, they took a hundred baskets with ten fruit each, Rabbi Yochanan would eat of all them and swear that he was as hungry as if he never ate. Rabbi Abahu ate the fruit of Genosar until a fly would slip off his forehead. Rav Ami and Rav Assi would eat until their hair would fall out. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would eat until he became delirious, and Rabbi Yochanan would notify the Exilarch who would send a troop of men to bring him home.
<br />
<br />
When does one say a complete prayer after a meal? Rabban Gamliel says that if he eats grapes or figs, or any of the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=8#P5140">seven special species</a>, the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=8#P5142">and you will eat and be satisfied and bless God</a>” applies to him. Rabbi Akiva says that even if he ate only vegetables, and it was his complete meal – he says the complete prayer. The Sages, however, say that he says a complete after-meal prayer only after bread, since the other seven species are too far from “and you will bless,” and vegetables are not even mentioned there.

Brachot 45 – Three people ate together
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVSROMjzUw5LnxT8AOBt3J3u6xHrDe41rrO0sfcqUPBoxcYFzQGtg0suOFfhJ_kSGFjtcfD23KCQDqldI5aXwcc8cf287usjCAd7NFHd1a7FwyNL9QtWP0dut2QrbrL41Xf2kpCmw3bGlx/s1600/Gillis+Van+Tilborch+-+Elegant+company+at+a+table+on+a+terrace.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVSROMjzUw5LnxT8AOBt3J3u6xHrDe41rrO0sfcqUPBoxcYFzQGtg0suOFfhJ_kSGFjtcfD23KCQDqldI5aXwcc8cf287usjCAd7NFHd1a7FwyNL9QtWP0dut2QrbrL41Xf2kpCmw3bGlx/s320/Gillis+Van+Tilborch+-+Elegant+company+at+a+table+on+a+terrace.jpg" width="258" /></a>The Torah said, “And you shall eat, and be satisfied, and you shall bless God your Lord for the good Land that He gave you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;We thus see that after a complete meal with bread, one must say a prayer containing thanks for the sustenance, for the Land of Israel and for Jerusalem (the good Land). 
<br />
<br />
In addition, if three people ate together, they must call each other to join in this prayer. This is true even if the food they ate had some limitations. For example, in the case of food from which tithes may not have been separated – still, since one can renounce all his possessions, become  poor, and be free of the obligation to tithe.
<br />
<br />
This joining in prayer removes the obstacles on the way of the prayer and allows it to rise up; and also brings an additional level of joy. What is the source for it? – It is this phrase: “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=32#P5756">When I proclaim&nbsp;God's name, praise God for His greatness</a>.”<br />

Brachot 46 – The host breaks bread, and the guest blesses
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEMSySZkDFPR2UxYAws7dkXpAzMsoT4qWyVr4Jx6KiVZKgkl_gZvtKPLHTGngL2mvkTqR-2x8279ztvCMOlzl-EmqPOT6tavCCRIJ4I9HR4gSeev7xs4bPqR3WR1kL2MIt6Ewoa3RTHCrf/s1600/George,+of+Chichester+Smith+-+Still+Life+With+Bread,+Cheese+And+A+Decanter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEMSySZkDFPR2UxYAws7dkXpAzMsoT4qWyVr4Jx6KiVZKgkl_gZvtKPLHTGngL2mvkTqR-2x8279ztvCMOlzl-EmqPOT6tavCCRIJ4I9HR4gSeev7xs4bPqR3WR1kL2MIt6Ewoa3RTHCrf/s320/George,+of+Chichester+Smith+-+Still+Life+With+Bread,+Cheese+And+A+Decanter.jpg" width="320" /></a>Rabbi Zeira once took ill, and Rabbi Abahu, who came to visit him, took upon himself a vow, “If this small man with singed thighs recovers, I will make a big meal for the Sages.” At the meal, Rabbi Abahu invited Rabbi Zeira to say the blessing and break the bread, but Rabbi Zeira refused, quoting the rule that “The host breaks bread.” When after the meal Rabbi Abahu asked Rabbi Zeira to saying the prayer after the meal, he again refused, saying that the one who broke bread should also say the prayer after it. However, the last rule is not like that. Rather, the host breaks bread, because he will give big pieces with a good gesture, and the guest says the prayer after the meal, in which he includes a blessing for the host.
<br />
<br />
What is the blessing for the host? – May it be the will of God that the host will not be shamed in this world, and not humiliated in the World to Come; may he be successful with all his possessions, and may the though of wrongdoing never come before him – or before us.
<br />
<br />
Why was Rabbi Zeira called a "small man with singed thighs?" Every thirty days he used to seat himself in a burning oven, to test whether he was vulnerable to fire, as an indication whether the fire of Gehinnom would ultimately have an effect on him. He was never harmed except once, when an evil eye was cast upon him, and that is how he got his nickname. "Zeira" means small one.

On the road one should not allow a more important person to proceed first if this will upset the traffic, nor should one allow him to pass on the bridge first if there is any danger crossing that bridge. 
<br />
<br />
Ravin and Abaye were once traveling on the road, and Ravin's donkey went ahead of Abaye's donkey. Abaye reasoned to himself, “Ever since this Rabbi (Ravin) returned from Israel, he became haughty.” When they came to an entrance of a synagogue, Ravin said, “Let the master go in first.” Abaye asked him, “And until now I was not the master?” However, Ravin answered by quoting Rabbi Yochanan – “We don't accord honor at the entrance unless it has a mezuzah.” But the synagogue does not require a mezuzah!? – Ravin would explain, “Such an entrance that is fit for a mezuzah.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Yehudah said, “People who are dining together are not permitted to eat anything until the one who blesses and breaks the bread tastes of it first.” Rav Safra said, “Not&nbsp;permitted&nbsp;to <i>taste</i>.” But there is no difference between them, both teach proper etiquette, only one is supposed to relate the rules he heard from his teacher using the exact words of the teacher.

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/09/brachot-45-three-people-ate-together.html">Earlier we learned</a> that if three people ate together, they must invite each other for an after-meal prayer. This invitation is called “zimun.” However, there are cases when they should not combine – such as when one of them ate food that was not kosher. A learned person should not join unlearned boors. 
<br />
<br />
Who is considered a boor? – Anyone who does not say the Shema in the evening and in the morning – this is the definition of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says, “Anyone who does not wear tefillin.” Ben Azzai says, “Anyone who does not have tzitzit fringes on his four-cornered garment.” Rabbi Nathan says, “Anyone who does not have a mezuzah on his home's entrance.” Rabbi Nathan bar Yosef says, “Anyone who has children but does not raise them to study Torah.” Others say, “Even if he learned the five books of the Torah and the clear rulings of the Mishna, he is a boor is he has not studied the Talmud” – and the accepted law is like these “others,” which is a codename for Rabbi Meir.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ami said, “Two scholars and Shabbat complete a three-people quorum required for a common call to prayer (zimun).” But is Shabbat a person? – Rather, two scholars, if they sharpen each other intellectually (which is mostly manifest in a relaxed meal on Shabbat) complete a three-people quarum.” Rav Chisda motioned, “Like me and Rav Sheshet,” and Rav Sheshet indicated, “Like me and Rav Chisda.”
<br />
<br />
King Yannai killed all the Sages, and there was no one left to say the after-meal prayer for him and the queen. His wife then made him swear that he won't harm a Sage, and called her brother, Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach, whom she had in hiding. They gave Rabbi Shimon a cup of wine, and he asked, “What do I say now? Blessed is the One Whose food Yannai has eaten?” Rather, he drank that cup, including himself in the meal, and proceeded to say the prayer with the next cup. The Talmud asks how he was allowed to do it, since he only drank but did not eat with them.<br />

Brachot 49 – What to mention in the prayer after a meal
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfwE5GKE6mD8uEuyFXTuImiO2885sLss-a3a2Ug-CN1LiuNslhoy1DN7VicJ4A7r9JaCj9U0vJL6hyGIExWiuDVx3F0bw3GeRCghIv9UDPq0aUCaHKx_kiMz8JB5R6hLgLdBPODwT84lmE/s1600/Jacques+des+Rousseaux+-+An+Old+Man+At+Prayer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfwE5GKE6mD8uEuyFXTuImiO2885sLss-a3a2Ug-CN1LiuNslhoy1DN7VicJ4A7r9JaCj9U0vJL6hyGIExWiuDVx3F0bw3GeRCghIv9UDPq0aUCaHKx_kiMz8JB5R6hLgLdBPODwT84lmE/s320/Jacques+des+Rousseaux+-+An+Old+Man+At+Prayer.jpg" width="240" /></a>Rav Nachman explained the composition of the after-meal prayer: Moses composed for Israel the first part, the blessing of “One Who nourishes all,” at the time when manna fell for them from heaven. Joshua composed the second blessing, “For the Land of Israel” when they entered the Land. David and Solomon composed together the third blessing, “The Builder of Jerusalem.” David composed the segment of “Have mercy on Israel Your people and on Jerusalem Your city,” and Solomon, who built the Temple, composed the segment of “The great and holy House.” 
<br />
<br />
After the destruction of the Second Temple, the Sages in Yavneh composed the fourth and final part, “Who is good and Who gives good,” after the siege of Bethar. The “Who is good” refers to the fact that although the bodies of the people slain at Bethar were not allowed to be buried for seven years, they did not decay, and the “Who gives good” refers to the fact that finally they were allowed to be buried.
<br />
<br />
One must mentioned the covenant of circumcision and of the Land, as well as the Kingdom of the House of David. Rav Zeira once said to Rav Chisda, “Come, master, and let us study the Talmud.” However, Rav Chisda replied, “I have not learned how to properly say the after-meal prayer, and I should study the Talmud?” Rav Zeira asked, “Why is this?” and Rav Chisda explained: “I was at the table of the Exilarch, and I recited the after-meal prayer, and did not mention the three covenants, and I saw Rav Sheshet straighten his neck like a snake, as if to attack me.”
<br />
<br />
And why didn't Rav Chisda mention the covenentants? - Because he followed the opinion of Rav that it is not necessary. However, in doing so he neglected all other opinions, and besides, there were different version of what Rav really said.

Brachot 5 – Prayer Shema at Bedtime

Why? The psalm says, “Reflect in your hearts while on your beds, and then be silent.” Resh Lakish sees another lesson here: a man should constantly agitate his good thoughts against the bad ones (“Agitate and don't sin”); if he removes the bad, good, but if not – let him study Torah (“reflect in your hearts”); if he wins, good, if not – let him say the Shema (“on your beds”); if that does not help, he should remind himself of the day of death (“be silent”).
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Zeira said, “Look how the Holy One Blessed Be He is not like a person of flesh and blood. If a person sells a cherished object to another, he is sad, and the buyer is happy. But the Holy One Blessed Be He gave the Torah to Israel, and He rejoiced, saying 'For I have given you a good doctrine, do not abandon My Torah.'”
<br />
<br />
If a person sees afflictions befalling him, he should investigate his deeds since the nature of the distress may have a hint for him. If he examined his deeds and did not find anything, he should attribute it to the neglect of Torah study, based on the phrase “Fortunate is the man whom God afflicts, and whom You teach from Your Torah.” If he did not find that either, they are “afflictions of love,” since “For God rebukes the one He loves.”

One should include himself in the call and say “Let us bless Him Whose food we have eaten,” and if there are ten or more, he adds the name of God, saying, “Let us bless God...” If there are more than ten, he still calls them in the same way – these are the words of Rabbi Akiva, who compares this to a prayer leader in the synagogue: such leader does not turn back to count the number of people, and does not change his words based on the size of the group.

However, Rabbi Yose HaGlili bases his logic on the phrase, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2668.htm">Bless God in congregations,</a>” which he understands to mean that the text of the call depends on the size of the congregation. For example, if more than ten thousand people ate together, one would say “Let us bless God our Lord, the God of Israel, Lord of Hosts, Who dwells by the Cherubim, for the food we have eaten.”
<br />
<br />
Accordingly, if three people ate together, they are not allowed to separate and say their after-meal separately, for in doing so that would loose their common call to prayer, “zimun.” The same is true for four and five, but six may separate into two groups of three. Again, ten people may not separate, but if there are twenty, they may form two groups of ten.

Brachot 51 – Respect for food

One should also not throw it or support his plate with bread: even if that does not ruin the bread, the act itself is disrespectful.
<br />
<br />
Ten things were said about a cup of wine used for a blessing, such as that it requires prior washing from the inside and outside, that one should take it with both hands but then hold in his right hand, and then send it in a respectful manner to his household (that it, to his wife).
<br />
<br />
Ulla visited the  house of Rav Nachman. He ate bread, led the call to prayer, recited the after-meal prayer, and then gave the cup of blessing to Rav Nachman, who asked him to send it to his wife, Yalta. However, Ulla retored that it was not necessary, since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=7#P5119">God will bless the fruit of your belly</a>,” and your wife's belly will be blessed through yours. Yalta heard this, stood up in anger, and went to the cellar, where she broke four hundred barrels of wine. Rav Nachman said, “Let the master send her another cup.” Ulla sent her another cup with the message, “All the wine in this barrel is considered like the cup of the blessing.” Yalta sent back, “From itinerant peddlers come idle words, and from old rags come lice.”

Brachot 52 – Laws of the meal, Beit Shammai vs Beit Hillel
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1X1-yLzYrjD4LGqWx8lwkrSaVeQnRpHFcMgRzTxO1bVz3DmtYLYsgaQmobNZ5G0yurqEsNkcYsgS9sLWsloiYDPTTlF6LhZO6lxHtwomV6NgZm7uQjTv1hLkD3g1AO07S-A6NgzLIpq1h/s1600/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+Sweeper.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1X1-yLzYrjD4LGqWx8lwkrSaVeQnRpHFcMgRzTxO1bVz3DmtYLYsgaQmobNZ5G0yurqEsNkcYsgS9sLWsloiYDPTTlF6LhZO6lxHtwomV6NgZm7uQjTv1hLkD3g1AO07S-A6NgzLIpq1h/s320/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+Sweeper.jpg" width="227" /></a>Some of the disagreements between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel concern specifically the order of meals. For example, when one recites Kiddush (Sanctification) welcoming Shabbat and the Shabbat meal, then Beit Shammai says that he should first mention the day (Shabbat) and then the wine, and Beit Hillel reverse the order. Why? Beit Shammai defend their order: the day (Shabbat) causes the wine and the meal, and besides, Shabbat is already here, and the wine is only now brought to the table. However, Beit Hillel argue that the wine causes the sanctification, since if there is no wine, the Kiddush is not said. Moreover, wine is more common than Shabbat, and the rule is that  things that are more common take precedence.
<br />
<br />
When to wash one's hands? Beit Shammai say that one should first wash the hands, then pour the cup of wine and say the Kiddush, and Beit Hillel reverse the order. Here the disagreement is about the intricate laws of ritual purity. Beit Shammai say that if the hands are not washed, the liquid that is on the outside of the cup may accept impurity from the hands and then transmit it to the inside of the cup. Beit Hillel argue that if you do wash the hands first, then the liquid on the outside of the cup may transmit impurity to the hands, and nothing is gained by washing them! However, according to Beit Shammai one may not use a cup whose outside is impure.
<br />
<br />
The other disagreements are where to put the napkin, when to sweep the floor, and how to properly say the Havdallah – the separation between Shabbat and weekday, after Shabbat has ended, and for all of them the Talmud finds the underlying reasons.

Brachot 53 – Where to say the after-meal prayer
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

After Shabbat ends, one recites the Havdallah – the separation between Shabbat and a weekday. Here Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel argue whether one should say “Who creates illuminations of the fire” or “illumination of the fire.” Incidentally, one should say the blessing on the fire, but not one used for idolatrous purposes, not one lighted for prohibited work during Shabbat, and not one lighted in honor of someone. It should be fire started to give light – since he did not light any fire on Shabbat, and to commemorate Adam, who discovered fire after Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
One should say the after-meal prayer in the place where he ate. What if he forgot and went away? Beit Shammai say that he should return. Beit Hillel asked them, “If one ate on top of a mansion, and forgot and went down, must he return to say the prayer, even with a great difficulty?” Beit Shammai replied, “If he left a purse with gold, would he not return? How much more so for prayer!"<br />
<br />
Rabbah bar bar Chanah was traveling with a caravan. When the caravan came to a stop, he ate and then forgot to recite the after-meal blessing. When the caravan started moving, he recalled this and thought to himself, “What am I to do? If I say that I forgot to say the prayer, they will tell me that God is everywhere.” Instead, he told them that he forgot a golden dove. After he came back and prayed, he indeed found a golden dove.

Brachot 54 – Blessings on miracles

<br />
This means that one should say a blessing on a miracle for the masses, but what about a private miracle? There was a certain man traveling through the desert on the south of Euphrates, and a lion attacked him. A miracle was performed for him, and he was rescued from the lion, and Rava told him to say “Who performed a miracle for me in this place.”
<br />
<br />
So too, Mar the son of Ravina was going through the valley of Aravot, thirsting for water, and a miracle was performed for him: a well was created, and he drank from it. At another time he was in the marketplace of Mechoza, and a wild camel attacjed him. However, a wall of a nearby house fell down, and he entered the house, thus escaping the camel. In both places he would say a blessing!? – True, one is obligated to say the blessing for this, but the others are not; however, for the miracle done for the masses all are obligated to say a blessing. Other cases include a seeing rock that Og wanted to throw on the Jewish people, or the stone on which Moses sat during a battle with Amalek.
<br />
<br />
In general, four events deserve a blessing: crossing a sea, a desert, being sick and recovering, and being  in prison and then released. All of these cases are described in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a7.htm">psalm 107</a>.  The blessing should be said in the presence of ten people, two of them being Torah scholars, because the psalm says, “Praise Him in the assembly of wise elders.”

Three things prolong the days and years of a person: spending long time in prayer, at the table, and in a toilet. But we learned that one who prays long comes away with a broken heart!? – That is if he depends on his merit to have his prayer answered, however, if he only asks for mercy, it is good. Why at a table? – Because, if a poor comes along, he can feed him. Why a toilet? – Because it is good for one's health.
<br />
<br />
A Roman matron said to Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai, “Your radiant face resembles that of the pigbreeders and userers.” He answered, “I swear that both occupations are forbidden to me, but from my home to the study hall there are twenty-four privies, and I check myself in every one of them.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda said, “An uninterpreted dream is like an unread letter.” He also said, “Neither a positive dream is fulfilled entirely, nor a negative one; in every dream there are false elements, just as there is straw with grain. When one sees a negative dream, its sadness is sufficient, and no more bad things will happen of those foretold in a dream, and for a positive dream – its joy is its own reward.”
<br />
<br />
When Shmuel saw a bad dream, he would quote from Zechariah, “Dreams speak lies.” When he saw a positive dream, he would say, “But do dreams speak lies?  - No! For it is written, '<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=12#P4063">In a dream I shall speak to him</a>', and this implies that dreams may have true significance.”

Brachot 56 – Dreams follow the interpretation

Once I had a dream and went to each one for the interpretation. Each one interpreted it in a different way, and all these interpretations were realized for me, following the principle stated in the Torah that 'all dreams follow the mouth', that is, the import of  a dream depends upon the interpretation given to it.” But is there such phrase in the Torah? – Indeed, yes, in the story of Joseph, where is says, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=41#P1209">Just as he interpreted it for us, so did it happen</a>.”<br />
<br />
Bar Hedya was an interpreter of dreams. If one gave him money, he would interpret the dream for the good, and for one who did not pay him – for the bad. Once Abaye and Rava both saw the same dream, and they asked Bar Hedya for the interpretation; Abaye gave him a zuz, whereas Rava did not give him any money. In their dreams, they both heard the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=28#P5637">Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat from it</a>.” To Rava he said, “Your business will fail, and on account of your great sorrow you will have no interest in eating,” but to Abaye he said, “Your business will profit, and on account of your great joy you will have no interest in eating.”
<br />
<br />
They then recounted another dream, in which they were read the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=28#P5647">Your sons and daughters will be given to another people</a>.” To Abaye he said, “Your sons and daughter will be numerous, and will want them to marry relatives from your side, but your wife will prevail to marry relatives from her side, and this is the same as another people.” To Rava he said, “Your wife will die, you will remarry, and your sons and daughters will come into the hands of another woman, their stepmother.”
<br />
<br />
After many more similar predictions Rava started giving him money, and Bar Hedya started giving him favorable interpretations. One day he predicted that a miracle will happen to Rava. As they were traveling on a ship, Bar Hedya decided to disembark, since he reasoned that a miracle might not happen to him, and in doing so dropped his manual of dream interpretations, where Rava saw a rule that “dreams follow the interpretation.” He then told Bar Hedya, “So you did all of that!? I forgive you all, except for the death of my wife. May your fall into the hands of a power that will have no pity on you.”
<br />
<br />
Bar Hedya decided to exile himself, hoping to mitigate Rava's curse. He went to Rome and got friendly with the gaurdian of the emperor's silk wardrobe. In his dream, the guardian saw a worm in his finger, but without payment Bar Hedya refused to interpret the dream. When he saw many worms, Bar Hedya told him that the wardrobe was ruined with worms, and they executed the guardian, but before he died, he told them about Bar Hedya, and they executed him also, by tying his legs to two bent cedar trees and then allowing them to straighten up.

<br />
<br />
A certain Sadducee (follower of a sect that denied the Torah) said to Rabbi Ishmael, “In my dream, I was pouring oil into olives.” Rabbi Ishmael replied, “He has evidently cohabited with his mother.” The Sadducee further said, “I have plucked a star from the sky.” Rabbi Ishmael told him, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=22#P565">You have kidnapped an Israelite</a>.” They continued this exchange revealing his wrongdoings, until he said, “I saw myself pealing eggs,” to which Rabbi Ishmael replied, “You stripped corpses,” and the Sadducee retorted, “I've done all but this last one.” At this time a woman came and said, “This garment you wear is from a dead man.” And the Sadducee? – He thought Rabbi Ishmael meant taking away the skin or the scalp. Finally, the Sadducee dreamed of his father leaving him property in Cappadocia, and since there was no factual connection between either him or his father to that city, Rabbi Ishmael told him that “Cappa” meant a beam in Persian, and “Deca” meant ten in Greek, and the tenth beam of the roof in his house would be full of coins, which indeed was the case.
<br />
<br />
A well portends peace. If one sees river in a dream, he should arise and recite “Behold I will extend peace to Jerusalem, like a river,” before a negative verse comes to his mind, “travail shall come like a river.” The Talmud continues with many more signs and with ways to ameliorate the dreams.

Ben Zoma, on seeing the vast multitudes who came to the Temple on Festivals, would 
pronounce this blessing – but he would also add, “Blessed are You... who created all these to serve me.” What is the reason of Ben Zoma's second blessing?
<br />
<br />
The ultimate goal of the world is for people to attain the knowledge of God and purify their physical nature. Such individuals are rare. What is the purpose of the rest? – To keep the Sage company and to cultivate the land and develop the world, since otherwise the Sage would not have time for his pursuits. Ben Zoma also said, “What does a good guest say? – He thanks the host saying 'How much trouble did you go to to prepare this grand banquet!' Conversely, what does a bad guest say? – 'I only ate one piece and drank one cup, but all the trouble that this took is for his wife and children.'”

Ulla and Rav Chisda were walking along the road, and Rav Chisda uttered a sigh. Ulla asked him, “Don't you agree that a sigh breaks the body of a person?” Rav Chisda answered, “This is the house of Rav Chana, where sixty cooks were preparing meals for poor at all times, which had four entrances for all to enter, and with Rav Chana never taking his hand out of his purse, not to embarrass a poor by making him wait even a second – and it is now ruined!” Ulla answered, “The Temple is in ruins, and it is enough for a slave to be like the master” – and Rav Chisda was consoled.

Who diversifies the creatures,” and on seeing very beautiful creatures or trees he says “Blessed are You... Who has such in His world.” On strong winds, hurricanes and earthquakes one says, “Blessed are You... Whose strength and power fills the world.” 
<br />
<br />
When one sees the sun in exactly the same position as it was when it was first created, one says, “Blessed are You... who makes the work of creation,” and this blessing occurs once every twenty-eight years, with the last having been said in 2009.
<br />
<br />
When a good event happens, one says “Blessed are You... Who allowed me to reach this day,” and when others are also sharing as partners in his joy, he says, “Blessed are You... Who is good and does good.”
<br />
<br />
For example, if they tell one that his father died, he should first say “Blessed are You... the true judge,” and then “Blessed are You... Who allowed me to reach this day,” because of inheritance, and if he has others who inherit together with him, he says, “Blessed are You... Who is good and does good” instead.

Brachot 6 – Demons
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMCI52uWZPYF_g5MoZYXRO7YkzG5TKDrfUF4oFYfxKBgyuGIi1OukwVC8Mr4FoayK8v0JDdRWoAetohTJGHKcNU4TZKFmztnV53R6wjT8pjHIzZkIhLiZxalX7uP30q-PwYlGpwDaJUc6b/s1600/Henriette+Ronner-Knip+-+A+black+cat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="229" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMCI52uWZPYF_g5MoZYXRO7YkzG5TKDrfUF4oFYfxKBgyuGIi1OukwVC8Mr4FoayK8v0JDdRWoAetohTJGHKcNU4TZKFmztnV53R6wjT8pjHIzZkIhLiZxalX7uP30q-PwYlGpwDaJUc6b/s320/Henriette+Ronner-Knip+-+A+black+cat.jpg" width="320" /></a>Abba Binyamin taught that there are many demons, invisible spiritual agents, and if an eye could see them,  no creature would be able to stand in face of them. Abaye added “They outnumber us.” Rava said, “The feeling that one is squeezed at a public lecture – it's because of them. The garments of the students who only study and do no hard work, when they wear out fast – it's because of them.” If one wants to see their steps, let him take sifted ashes and spread them around his bed, and in the morning he  will see marks like the footprints of a rooster. If one wants to see them, he should take a placenta of a female cat, that is a black cat, daughter of black cat, burn it, grind it, and put it in his eyes. He should hide the ashes in lead, and the whole practice is dangerous and not recommended.
<br />
<br />
God wears tefillin, as it were. What is written in them? “Who is like your people Israel.” But is the Holy One Blessed He praised with the praises of Israel? - Indeed, yes, as the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=26#P5578">You have praised God today, and He praised you</a>.”<br />
<br />
One who knows that his friend is accustomed to greet him, should greet his friend first, following the dictum of “Seek peace and pursue it.” If someone greets him, and he does not return the greeting, he is called a robber, as Isaiah said, “Property robbed from the poor is in your houses.” Why is "poor" mentioned? One should not steal from the rich either! - To tell us that he steals from a destitute, who does not have any possessions, and what he steals is a greeting.

Brachot 60 – Blessings on bad events
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3Gw7uSIzkrknitHHeQHOOG_8o29AjC-xCsilVoUJ3ga-8SygNVmWAIJfiTmrVMExiaLHPNVVGt6YqHs2SWrVVHpLvgz18x6Oxg0-iRkAENV_Z9aRzgmJs32_SN_UuHTbd9p4exkc8_QID/s1600/Arthur+von+Ferraris+-+The+Learned+Man.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3Gw7uSIzkrknitHHeQHOOG_8o29AjC-xCsilVoUJ3ga-8SygNVmWAIJfiTmrVMExiaLHPNVVGt6YqHs2SWrVVHpLvgz18x6Oxg0-iRkAENV_Z9aRzgmJs32_SN_UuHTbd9p4exkc8_QID/s320/Arthur+von+Ferraris+-+The+Learned+Man.jpg" width="243" /></a>If one prays about events that have already occurred, this is a prayer in vain – such as, for example, if he hears an outcry in the city and says, “May it be Your will that this is not in my house.” Even though a miracle might potentially change past events, but as a rule, one should not rely on miracles.
<br />
<br />
It once happened the Hillel was coming along the road, and as he heard screaming in the city, he said, “I am confident that this is not in my house.” To Hillel the following verse applies, “Of evil things he will not have fear; his heart is firm, confident in God.” In general, one should not worry too much, because this only betrays his own insecurities and wrongdoings. However, what about king Solomon's statement that “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2828.htm">Praiseworthy is the man who is always fearful</a>”? – that is talking about one who worries not to forget his learning.
<br />
<br />
One should bless God for the bad things in the same vein as he blesses for the good, by saying “Blessed be the true judge,” since all comes from God. However, we know this already! – This ruling is taught here for an additional lesson: even if some good can come of it later, right now it is bad. For example, if one's field is flooded, then, even though later it may result in increased productivity for the field, right now he says “Blessed be the true judge.”

Rav Yosef was called "Sinai" because his knowledge was broad and precise, as if it were acquired on Sinai. Rabbah was called an "uprooter of mountains" because of his supreme logic. From Israel came the advice to choose Rav Yosef because everyone needs knowledge, like wheat. But Rav Yosef declined because astrologers predicted that he would live for only two years after he became the head. During the twenty-two years that Rabbah was the head, Rav Yosef carefully avoided all signs of honor that would be due him. Ultimately, he became the head and lead for two and a half years.</p><p>Torah scholars increase peace in the world. <a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/2_samuel/15.htm" target="_blank">God will give might to His nation; God will bless His nation with peace.</a></p><p>Art: Reconciliation of David and Absalom by Rembrandt van Rijn</p>

Brachot 7 – God Prays

What is His prayer? “May it be My will that My mercy conquer My anger... and I will go beyond the boundary of judgment with My children.” Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, a High Priest, told that once on Yom Kippur he entered the Holy of Holies to burn incense and saw Achteriel God of Legions sitting on His throne, and God told him, “Ishmael, My son, bless Me.” He blessed God with “May it be Your will that Your mercy will conquer Your anger...” and saw God nod, demonstrating His approval. From here we saw that even a blessing of an ordinary person should not be unimportant in your eyes.
<br />
<br />
God also gets angry every day, as in psalms, “God is angered every day,” for a moment (“rega”) that lasts a quarter of a second. Bilam knew how to pronounce a curse at exactly this moment. The sign of this moment is a rooster standing on one foot, with a pale comb. Rabbi Yehoshua once took a rooster and tied him to his bed, in order to curse someone who was harassing him. However, when the time came, he dozed of, and said, “We see from here that it is not proper to curse, since '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26e5.htm">God's mercy is on all his creations</a>'.”
<br />
<br />
Moses asked God, “Why bad things happen to good people?” God answered, “A righteous who is the son (reincarnation) of a bad person may have it bad, but a righteous son of a righteous will have it good.”
<br />
<br />
In many instances the name of a person foretells his deeds. How do we know that a name actually influences one? – From the psalm, “God has made devastations (“shamot”) in the world.” Do not read “shamot” but “shemot” - names. Thus, names are put into the world to influence people.

Anyone who has a synagogues in his city and does not go there to pray is called an evil neighbor. 
<br />
<br />
The phrase “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2632.htm">Pray to God when He is (easily) found</a>” can also be understood as “Pray to God when you need to find (something).” What is this something one should pray for? – A good wife, as Solomon said, “One who found a wife found goodness.” Some say, this is Torah, about which Solomon said “He who find me finds life.” And some say, easy death when his time comes. The hardest death is similar to pulling branches of thorns from a ball of wool shearings, and the easiest is like removing a hair from milk.
<br />
<br />
Rava asked Rafram bar Pappa, "Tell us some of the great things that Rav Chisda said about a synagogue." Rafram answered: “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2687.htm">God loves the places where they study the Torah more than all the sanctuaries of Jacob (synagogues)</a>” - that is, God loves places of practical study of the law more than all synagogues. Then how is this a great thing about synagogues? - It is, because, synagogues God He loves next, right after study halls.<br />

The Sages agree to me in principle, only they wanted to distance a man from a mistake. Also, for example, offerings that are eaten for one day can be eaten all night, but the Sages limited it till midnight.”
<br />
<br />
He did not mention the Passover offering as such an example! This must mean that Rabban Gamliel takes sides in another disagreement, about a Passover offering. Here it is: Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says that the Passover offering can be eaten only until midnight, but Rabbi Akiva says that it can be eaten till morning. What are their proofs? Rabbi Elazar bases his on the phrase "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1825">They will eat the meat on this night</a>," and since when God passed through Egypt, it was also "this night," and meant midnight, then here too, the eating is only until midnight. And Rabbi Akiva? He says, "It means, this night, but not the next night. For otherwise you might have though that the Passover offering is eaten for a night, a day, and a following night, and 'This night' excludes this possibility."<br />
<br />
But what is the root cause of their disagreement? They argue about the word, "in haste," to whom it applies. If to Jews, then their haste was in the morning, and if to Egyptians, to send the Jews out, then this haste&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;at midnight.

Chagigah 13 – How to teach mysteries
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5SiqJp-PAUJGyOor52vav6lEyE2o7SeIoiOUvifpSUzriV7bOaX3PJFIp0BCTbXayAnDWIjncqUG-2RQLna0_5ROCFHgFpTNtRs_yIqDlX9DP8bZl0DzJz2x6oyJNskFu_fv4VCTK9QUu/s1600/Interior+Scene,+Called+'Mystery'%2BBy%2BEdouard%2B(Jean-Edouard)%2BVuillard.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="302" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5SiqJp-PAUJGyOor52vav6lEyE2o7SeIoiOUvifpSUzriV7bOaX3PJFIp0BCTbXayAnDWIjncqUG-2RQLna0_5ROCFHgFpTNtRs_yIqDlX9DP8bZl0DzJz2x6oyJNskFu_fv4VCTK9QUu/s1600/Interior+Scene,+Called+'Mystery'%2BBy%2BEdouard%2B(Jean-Edouard)%2BVuillard.jpg" width="320" /></a>One should not teach the mystery secrets (of Kabbalah) other than to someone who understands them on his own, and even then, he should only be told subject titles, but not the actual contents in detail. Some say it differently: anybody can be taught general ideas of Kabbalah, but to explain them with particulars – that is only for those who can understand them on their own.
<br />
<br />
The reason for the two approaches is as follows: the first school says that it is impossible to transmit the mystery from a teacher to the student. Such attempt will inevitably result in misinterpretation and dangerous misunderstanding. The other, however, maintains, that it is possible to faithfully transmit deep secrets, provided that the student is worthy. 
<br />
<br />
Here is one example of such teachings: "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1201.htm">The Chayot (literally, live beings) angels ran to and fro, like the appearance of broken fire</a>." This can be understood that they were raising their heads above their level but then immediately drawing them back out of fear of Divine presence. This phrase also teaches a meditative device of swinging between extremes in the perception of the Divine, like a pendulum, gradually expanding its swing.<br />
<br />
What is meant by "broken fire?" It alludes to purifying gold when the fire is darting through the openings in the shards. The word for "broken fire," "bazak," has the connotation of earthenware shards and also of fire.<br />

Chagigah 2 – Celebration and joy

This is actually an obligation: one must make merry. One of the ways of doing so is by bringing the "celebration" sacrifice (chagigah) and eating the meat.
<br />
<br />
More specifically, one must come to the Temple during a Holiday. Having arrived, one should bring a sacrifice because the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2157" target="_blank">Do not appear before Me empty-handed</a>." But who is this "one?" In other words, who is obligated to visit the Temple and bring the sacrifice?<br />
<br />
All males are obligated to go to the Temple, following the commandment of "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2159" target="_blank">Three times a year every male must appear before God, the Master of the Universe</a>." Women and minors do not have to go. Also not included are people of undetermined sex (tumtum), hermaphrodite, a deaf-mute, deranged, and one who physically can't walk up the Temple Mount.<br />
<br />
Why does the rule start with "All males" if later it gives all the details? - This is to silently include an additional class of people, half-free and half-slave. We have <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/08/daf-in-100-words-gittin-41_21.html" target="_blank">discussed this unique situation before</a>: this person cannot marry a slave woman because he is free but cannot marry a free woman because he is a slave. He does not have to visit the Temple either. However, the Sages later establishes that the court should force the slave's master to free the half-slave part.<br />

Chagigah 20 – Many levels of purity
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

On the Holidays, there is a special requirement to purify oneself, in general, because one is going to visit the Temple, eat sacrifices, and eat foods of the second tithe, which all require special attention to purity.
<br />
<br />
However, it is not enough to go to the mikvah, but one also needs to keep in mind why he is going there and keep this in mind consistently. For example, some people would eat their regular food only in a state of purity. And yet, when such a person goes into a mikvah, it is only suitable for everyday foods. He would not be allowed to eat the second tithe. Even though it is the same mikvah and the same person, it is not the same level of attention. Thus, while being "pure for regular food," he may have missed some subtle source of impurity which would prohibit him from eating the second tithe – just because he was not watching for it. There are five such levels: regular foods, second tithe, priestly portion, sacrificial foods, and finally, the ashes of the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/09/avodah-zarah-24-making-of-red-heifer.html">red heifer</a>.<br />
<br />
Examples of these rulings: two women accidentally exchanged their clothing, and even though they each watched them keep them in the state of purity, still Rabbi Akiva declared both sets of clothing impure. Why? As soon as the first woman realized that her dress was on her friend, of whom she was not sure if she knew all the laws – she lost concentration on her clothing, and this moment was enough to distract her, and any time one does not watch explicitly the purity, it is lost.
<br />
<br />
Another one: a woman asked Rabbi Ishmael a question – she was pure while weaving a garment, but she did not intend to watch the garment. In the course of queries, she recalled that before a significant piece of clothing was formed, she may have made some threads impure at the beginning of weaving. Said Rabbi Ishmael, "How great are the words of the Sages, who said that purity requires concentration."

Chagigah 21 – How is one level of purity different from another?

However, this is not mentioned anywhere in the Torah, where a food or a person can by either ritually pure or not. (Even that is not practiced today, when there is no Temple and no ashes of red heifer).
<br />
<br />
The Sages though instituted those multiple levels of purity, in order to train people in guarding objects from impurity. Holy (sacrifice-related) objects and the priest's portion (terumah) represent  the fourth and the third levels of purity. There are ten areas where the purity of holy objects is stricter than those of priest's portion.
<br />
<br />
For example, when one takes objects to a mikveh to purify them by submersing in its water, he can dip them with one object being inside the other – so long as the water enters into all areas of the object; but this is allowed for priest's portion but not for holy objects. Why? It may happen that one of the objects, the one which is inside the other, is too heavy, and the place of their contact does not admit water. That is not a serious concern though, and the Sages added this only for holy objects.

Chagigah 22 – Enmity of the ignorant

However, this does not go well with the ignorant and causes their enmity toward the learned.
<br />
<br />
Here is an example. Holy objects are accepted for sacrifice from the ignorant in the hope that they did prepare them in purity. However, the priest's portion, "terumah," is not accepted by the knowledgeable priests because perhaps the ignorant made it impure by mistake, and it would be forbidden to eat it. This seems illogical. If anything, we should not believe the ignorant about the priest's portion, which is less strict, and not on sacrifices!
<br />
<br />
Look at consequences, though. If a knowledgeable priest refuses to accept a portion from an ignorant, then the ignorant will be upset, but at worst, he will now go and give his unrequited portion to his ignorant friend priest. However, if the priests do not accept his items for sacrifices, he may go and build himself another Temple – therefore, they accept his oil and wine, presuming them to be pure.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua could not understand some of the opinions of Beit Shammai regarding ritual purity, and he exclaimed, "You should be ashamed of yourself, the (already dead) Sages of Beit Shammai!" One of the students explained to him the reason related above, about ignorant people not accepting that their utensils were impure, and thus elucidated the logic." As a result, Rabbi Yehoshua fasted many days until his teeth blackened, since he has offended the memory of the Sages wrongly, and Beit Hillel changed their rulings to agree with those of Beit Shammai."

Chagigah 25 – Loopholes for the ignorant

However, we also said that this is sometimes lifted for the sake of the ignorant populace.
<br />
<br />
For example, when an ignorant farmer brings oil or wine for his sacrifices, they are accepted, even though the vessels in which he brings them are most likely ritually impure. The law is lifted for the following reason: if the ignorant were excluded, they might build their own Temple. There was also a hope that they will be influence by the Temple's holiness for the good. This, however, is a loophole, and to avail of it, the consecration of the wine or oil must occur before the pressing, since this leads the farmer to purify his vessels first. 
<br />
<br />
By contrast, there is no such danger in not accepting a priestly portion (terumah) from them – the ignorant will give it instead to another Kohen, his friend, who is just as ignorant of the law of purity as the giver. Thus, the laws of terumah are stricter here. And yet, this same terumah may be accepted from the ignorant at the general time of wine pressing. This is because knowledgeable people usually supervise the purification of all vessels for harvesting and pressing, and the priests can rely on that. The Sages also did not want the scholarly priest to be entirely left without the priestly portion.<br />

This leads to a problem: since clay vessels are often used for sacrifices, and since after use they becomes "leftovers" (or "notar") and hence must be broken, and furthermore, since no kilns were permitted in the Jerusalem – people could not obtain clay vessels that would be ritually pure. Therefore, the Sages lifted their distrust of the ignorant, but only under specific circumstances: clay vessels manufactured between Jerusalem and Modiin were declared ritually pure. This was only true for craftsmen in Modiin who were heading toward Jerusalem and not for resellers.
<br />
<br />
If thieves entered a house and stole earthenware vessels but then returned them – they are believed to say "we did not touch the inside," which would preserve the containers for use with sacrifices. This sounds strange. Thieves are usually ignorant of the details of ritual purity, and if they entered a house, we should presume that every room they had the time to reach should have its vessels impure! – These are exceptional thieves: they repented. Thus, they are believed in the purity of sacrifices also.

However, at the Festivals, this changes, and all are treated as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/chagigah-22-enmity-of-ignorant.html">trusted friends</a> ("chaverim"). This is based on the phrase "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0720.htm">And all Israel gathered to the city as one, and they were friends</a>" ("chaverim"). and on the custom of all Jews to purify themselves and their utensils for the Festivals.
<br />
<br />
Because of this unity, one can open a new barrel of wine for sale. It will be considered ritually pure, even though everybody touches it, including ignorant people. He can even finish selling this wine after the holidays – for otherwise, he would refrain from opening it – in Rabbi Yehudah's opinion. However,  the Sages don't go that far, and once the holidays are over, the wine is considered impure. Also, once the Holidays are over, all vessels in the Temple are purified. The two Altars, the copper one and the golden one, are never purified in a mikveh, and people are told to be especially careful and not touch them.
<br />
<br />
On the subject of Altars, Rabbi Abahu gives proof that the Torah Sages are not subject to the fire of Gehinnom, as follows. A salamander (which is created in a fire burning for seven years) is an offspring of fire, and yet a man who smears himself with its blood becomes immune to fire – then how much more so are the Sages, whose body itself is fire! – following the phase, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1123.htm">Here, my words are like fire, says God</a>."<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish takes this further. His proof is from the Golden Altar, which had a very thin golden covering, but the underlying wood would not waste away for hundreds of years. How much more so are even the sinners of Israel, for even they are full of mitzvot as pomegranates (following the Song of Sons, "Like a pomegranate are your temples ("rakateich") which can be understood as "reikatech" - the empty ones among you – who are still full of mitzvot.

Chagigah 3 – The case of a deaf-mute
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjB7PowQpmpNrXPd7oAspKAw8M595sm3-OZwbJuP1A5HSptz1mqJuY0Nkf695qfaZ5DoltzLX-xGr12rR_g_iYpYSNBmoMO5FrIQrcLS7KE6aTYIap1lETbnvm5eDkUj8ZkvAkKTh8VrWhA/s1600/Two+Brothers+by+Maurice+Leloir.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjB7PowQpmpNrXPd7oAspKAw8M595sm3-OZwbJuP1A5HSptz1mqJuY0Nkf695qfaZ5DoltzLX-xGr12rR_g_iYpYSNBmoMO5FrIQrcLS7KE6aTYIap1lETbnvm5eDkUj8ZkvAkKTh8VrWhA/s1600/Two+Brothers+by+Maurice+Leloir.jpg" width="228" /></a>Earlier, we said that a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/09/chagigah-2-celebration-and-joy.html">deaf-mute does not need to appear in the Temple</a>. Presumably, this is because he, in general, does not have to do the mitzvot, not being in the complete possession of his senses, and that is why he is mentioned next to a deranged person.
<br />
<br />
What about one who is only deaf or only mute? Generally, he has to do the mitzvot, but he still does not have to go to the Temple. Why? We have to admit that our ruling is incomplete, and the teacher intentionally omitted some words. Since going to the Temple on a Holiday is <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=31#P5735">for the purpose of hearing and learning</a>, and one who is deaf cannot hear, while a mute cannot learn, they don't have to go. However, the joy of the Holiday is still for them, and they should bring a "peace offering of joy" and eat it.
<br />
<br />
But is it true that one who cannot talk can't learn? Why, two mute brothers always attended the lessons of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, nodded in agreement, moved their lips. In the end, Rabbi Yehudah prayed for them, and they recovered, and it was found out that they knew all parts of the Torah!? Correct, but the purpose of learning is also teaching, and a mute cannot teach.
<br />
<br />
What does it mean that "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3112.htm">The words of the wise are as goads and as nails well-planted... given by one Shepherd</a>"? – That just like goads direct a cow in the field, so the words of the Torah direct people to good ways of life. Why are they fastened steady like nails? The difference is this. Nails take away from the wall. By contrast, mitzvot are "planted" and give back to those who observe them. Finally, they all come from one Master, and even though the Sages disagree, one can still find a correct way.

Chagigah 4 – When the Sages cried

Who is considered deranged? – One who goes alone at night to uninhabited places, sleeps in a cemetery and tears his clothes for no reason. Do we need him to do all three? Rav Huna said that we do. Rav Pappa said, "Had Rav Huna heard another definition - one who destroys all that people give him - he would change his mind." However, the Talmud is not convinced, for sleeping in a cemetery may be done for spiritual reasons, and walking alone at night can be explained by being depressed.
<br />
<br />
When he came in his studies to the following phrase, Rav Huna wept. The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2517">Three times a year, every male will come to be seen in the Temple.</a>"  "To be seen" can be read as "to see," and one who is blind in one eye does not have to go. Said Rav Huna, "The servant was beloved to his Master, and the Master wanted to see him, and now suddenly he is distanced!"
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar wept when he came to the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=45#P1362">And Joseph's brothers could not answer him, because they were confused</a>." He said, "If because of the rebuke of a human one is confused, how much more so before God!"
<br />
<br />
Rav Ami wept when he read about the destruction of the Temple and the following dispersion, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3203.htm">Let him put his mouth to the dust – perhaps there is hope.</a>" He said, "All this suffering – and only 'perhaps'!?"

Chagigah 5 - When God cries
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

The phrase "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=31#P5741">I will certainly hide My face on that day</a>" can be understood to mean that God will still help by hinting of impending troubles in a dream at night, which will lead to prayer and actions. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chanania was often in Caesar's palace, and once, someone from the entourage signaled to him, "You are a nation whose Master turned His face away from." Rabbi Yehoshua signaled him back, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1051.htm">His hand is yet outstretched to protect us</a>." Caesar asked, "What are these signals?" and Rabbi Yehoshua explained both what the man said and what he replied. Caesar then asked the man, and he said that he could not understand the reply. They Caesar said, "A man who does not understand signs, should he use them in the presence of the king?" and they executed him.
<br />
<br />
The phrase "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1113.htm">And if you don't heed this, My spirit will cry in hidden chambers, because of your haughtiness</a>" can be understood to mean that God cries because the exaltedness of Israel was removed, and some say because the exaltedness of God was removed. But is there crying before God? - Yes, in the inner chambers, and because of the Temple's destruction.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince was once reading Lamentations, and the book fell from his hand into a bottomless pit. He commented on this phrase from Lamentation, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3202.htm">He cast down from Heaven to earth the glory of Israel</a>," - and not only God lowered the glory of Israel to earth, but there - to the deepest places. The same Rabbi Yehudah, with his&nbsp;nephew&nbsp;Rabbi Chiya, once visited a town. They asked if there lived a Sage in town, and the people answered, "Yes, but he is blind." Rabbi Chiya wanted to go alone, saying that it did not fit Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, but Rabbi Yehudah insisted on greeting the Sage. At the end of the visit, the Sage said, "You visited one who is seen but cannot see. Therefore, may you merit to pay respect to the One Who sees but is not seen." Rabbi Yehudah commented, "Had I not come with you, I would not get this blessing."

Because of mystical reasons, some people observe this law even nowadays.<br />
<br />
If the knife was not inspected immediately after slaughter, but only some time afterward, and a nick was found on it, then Rav Huna declares the slaughter invalid. This is true even if the butcher was later smashing bones with the knife later in the day, and it is likely that the nick originated then. Rav Huna is consistent with <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/chullin-9-need-to-validate-slaughter.html">his own opinion</a> that an animal is considered forbidden for consumption unless for know with certainly how it was slaughtered.<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda, however, declares the meat kosher. What is his logic? The nick may have been caused by the animal's hide or by a bone. The hide is unlikely to cause the nick, while the bone is likely to do so. Weighing unlikely against the likely, we say that the nick was caused by a bone later on, and the slaughter was done with a good knife and is therefore valid.<br />

Chullin 100 – Does The Sciatic Sinew Have Taste?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Ishmael says that the sinew has so little taste that it does not count. Therefore, even if it is cooked together with other foods, it does not render them prohibited, as long as it is taken out. Thus, Rabbi Ishmael argues against <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/10/chulin-97-one-in-sixty.html">our earlier teaching</a>, and in fact the law follows his view.  That is true if the sinew itself is removed. But even if it not removed, why don't we say that the prohibited sinew is nullified in the majority of other sinews? That is because the sinew is a complete “creation,” and the law of nullification by majority does not apply to complete creations – they never get nullified.
<br /><br />
What happens when a non-kosher food cooks together with kosher food and is not nullified in one-in-sixty, making the whole mixture prohibited? Do we view it as basically kosher food, with too much taste of non-kosher one, or do we view the entire mixture as completely new non-kosher entity? The practical difference between the two points of view arises when the mixture falls into a large pot, and we need to know if it is now nullified or not? The law follows the second alternative.

<span style="font-size: medium;">The prohibition of  a sciatic sinew applies to a kosher animal, but it does not apply to a non-kosher one. What difference does it make, if a non-kosher animal is anyway forbidden to be eaten? One is transgressing a different prohibition when eating it – the prohibition of a non-kosher animal, and not the one of a sciatic sinew. That is important for giving him a proper warning, that is, telling him exactly what prohibition he transgresses, moments before he eats it, as a prerequisite for lashes. 
<br /><br />
Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that the sciatics sinew of a non-kosher animal is also forbidden – because it was prohibited since the time of Jacob, when non-kosher animals were still permitted. The Sages replied to Rabbi Yehudah, “The sciatic sinew prohibition was first given to Moses on Sinai, and it did not apply before then. However, when Moses recorded and arranged the Torah, he recorded this prohibition in the context of Jacob's encounter with the angel, to teach that this incident was the reason for the prohibition.”

<span style="font-size: medium;">It is prohibited to eat a limb taken from an animal while it was alive. Even if the animal is later slaughtered, the limb retains its prohibited status. This applies to both kosher and non-kosher animals – so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar, but the Sages say that this prohibition applies only to kosher animals.
<br /><br />
Both opinions are derived from the same source. The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=12#P5258">Only be strong not to eat blood, for the blood is the life, you shall not eat the life with the flesh</a>.” Just as blood is forbidden in kosher and non-kosher animals, so is the limb torn from a live animal – so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar. And the Sages? They say that “You shall not eat the life with the flesh” indeed prohibits a limb, but it should be such an animal that “flesh without life” should be permitted – that is, a kosher animal, whose meat may be eaten.
<br /><br />
How much of a limb one has to eat to transgress? – An olive's volume. Alternatively, a complete limb, a “creation,” even if smaller than an olive's volume, makes him liable also.

<span style="font-size: medium;">If one ate a live small kosher bird, is he liable for eating limbs from a live animal? Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that he is not liable, since a live bird is a creature in its own right, not a collection of limbs. Neither is he liable for eating its meat, because it is small, less than an olive volume. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon disagrees: if he is liable to each limb, then of course he is liable for the whole bird, which is the best limb of all!

If one took a small piece of a limb from a living animal, the size of an olive, but cut it in two, and then ate them, he is not liable. However, if he cut it in two inside his mouth with his teeth, then he is liable, because his throat enjoyed an entire olive's volume at one time – so says Rabbi Yochanan. However, Resh Lakish disagrees, because less than an olive's volume went into his stomach at one time. Now, since people chew their food, then according to Resh Lakish, he would never be liable!? – Truly, he would, if he ate a small whole bone.

<span style="font-size: medium;">The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2161">You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk</a>.”  Since it repeated this <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2520">again</a> &nbsp;and <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=14#P5306">again</a>, then only only cooking, but eating such mixture or selling it is also prohibited. At this the Torah prohibition stops. For example, eating cold meat with cold milk would be allowed. However, the Sages extended the prohibition with safeguards. Thus the rule: all kinds of meat should not be cooked with milk, except for the meat of fish and locusts. It is also forbidden to serve meat and milk or cheese on the table together. 
<br /><br />
Beit Shammai allows to place chicken and cheese on the same table, provided that they are not eaten together. Rabbi Yose says that this is one of the unusual leniences of Beit Shammai over Beit Hillel. In truth, Rabbi Yose is the author of this complete ruling, but initially it was taught anonimously. When the teacher learned who was its author, he added Rabbi Yose's name, because one who transmits a teaching in the name  of the one who said it saves the world – just as Esther did when she told the king about a plot against him in the name of Mordechai.

Chullin 105 – Waiting Between Meals
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">There is a Jewish custom to wait some length of time, up to six hours, after eating a meat dish and before a dairy dish. This is a precaution: the taste of meat lingers in one's mouth, and meat pieces get stuck between the teeth, as in “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=11#P4055">The meat was still between their teeth</a>.”<br />
<br />
Agra said, “Fowl and cheese may be eaten one after the other in a carefree manner, without washing one's hands and without cleaning the mouth with food and drink.” Rav Yitzchak visited Rav Ashi's home. They brought him cheese, and he ate it; they then brought domestic animal meat, and he ate it without washing his hands. They questioned his behavior, “Agra taught that fowl and cheese may be eaten in a carefree manner, but not any meat!?” He answered, “This applies only at night, but by day, when I can see that my hands are clean from cheese, no washing is required.”
<br />
<br />
Mar Ukva said, “Regarding this matter I am like vinegar the son of wine compared to my father. For my father waited for twenty-four hours after meat before eating cheese, and I eat cheese at the next meal.”

Chullin 106 – Washing One's Hands

<span style="font-size: medium;">Washing the hands before the meal is a mitzvah, but washing them afterwards is an obligation, because of the dangerous salt that may be present on the hands. The first water may be warm, but the last water must be cold.
<br />
<br />
Two porters once carried a barrel of wine and stopped to rest, placing the barrel under a drainpipe. The invisible demon frequently found under  a drainpipe caused the barrel to burst. The porters sued the demon in the court of Mar bar Rav Ashi. At first the demon refused to come, but Mar, adept at practical kabbalah, forced him with shofar blowing, and he appeared. Mar asked, “Why did you break the barrel?” The demon answered, “What was I to do, when they placed the barrel on my ear as I was sleeping.” However, Mar told him, “Since you slept in a public place, you are the one who acted irregularly, and you have to pay.” The demon asked for some time, and avoided the payment in the end.
<br />
<br />
It once happened that someone did not wash his hands before the meal, was taken for a non-Jew, and was fed pork as a result.<br />

Chullin 107 – Two Strangers at a Table

<span style="font-size: medium;">One may wrap meat and cheese in one cloth, as long as they don't touch one another. Now, even if they did touch, what would be the problem? If they are wet, they would have to be washed before eating, and a person might forget to do so.
<br />
<br />
Two people in a restaurant may eat at one table, one meat and the other one cheese. That is true for strangers, who don't share food with each other. However, if they know each other and may share food, they need an additional reminder, something placed on the table.
<br />
<br />
Two brothers who are on bad terms and are particular not to eat from one another, can they eat meat and cheese at the same table? On the one hand, if we allow them to eat together, people will wonder, why all other brothers are not allowed to eat meat and cheese at one table, and these are? On the other hand, someone who has only one shirt would be allowed to wash it on a weekday of a Holiday, while others are forbidden. However, the last is not a good comparison, because his situation is special, and this is evident to all.

Chullin 108 – A Drop of Milk

<span style="font-size: medium;">If a drop of milk fell onto a slice of meat that was cooking in a pot, then if the drop contained enough milk to impart a flavor to that slice, it is prohibited. Since in this case no one was stirring the pot, the milk spread throughout the piece on which it fell but no further.
<br />
<br />
If someone was stirring the pot when the drop fell in, the milk was not absorbed into that slice on which it fell, but continued to travel through the slice out into the soup, and dispersed throughout the entire contents of the pot. Now if the drop contains enough milk to impart a flavor into that entire pot, it is prohibited.
<br />
<br />
Rav said, “In the ruling's first case, the words 'it is prohibited' refer not only to that piece, but to the entire pot.” Why?! According to Rav, the complete slice, having become forbidden because of a drop of milk, acquires the status of prohibited meat, or nevelah. Now there is much more prohibited matter in the pot, affecting the whole. Furthermore, Rav follows Rabbi Yehudah, who says that like matters (meat in meat) never become nullified.

Chullin 109 – The Udder

<span style="font-size: medium;">Since the Torah said, “You shall not cook a young goat in its mother's milk,” only milk from an animal that is fit to be a mother and is alive falls under this prohibition. Still, the Sages prohibited cooking other meat in this milk. Nonetheless, the meat of the udder is different.
<br />
<br />
One should tear open the udder prior to cooking and extract its milk. If he did not tear it open and prepared it as is, he does not transgress on account of it. Rabbi Zeira said, “It is permitted to consume the udder prepared with its milk.” But we just learned that “one does not transgress on account of it.” This seemed to imply that it is prohibited by the Sages, only that one does not transgress the Torah!? Rabbi Zeira was talking about roasting, where the milk drips off, and the ruling – about boiling, where the milk gets out, becomes prohibited, then gets reabsorbed.
<br />
<br />
Yalta, the wife of Rav Nachman, said to him, “Whatever God forbade us, he allowed something similar. For example, there is a fish that tastes like pig, and one can marry a non-Jewish woman whom he captures in battle. I want to eat meat in milk.” Rav Nachman asked his chefs to roast udders on a spit for her.

However, what is their source?<br />
<br />
Chazakah says that we can assume things to stay the way they were when we last observed them (absent indications to the contrary). It is derived from the way the kohen inspects houses for signs of spiritual leprosy (tzaraat): once he sees a specific discoloration on a wall of a house, he can close the house off for seven days and pronounce it under quarantine. But how can he do it? Perhaps while he was going to the door, the discoloration became smaller or disappeared. We see that he is allowed to assume that the status quo has not changed. This principle can then be used in other areas of the law. <br />
<br />
How do we know the principle of majority?  – One who strikes his parent is to be executed. But how do we know that it is his real father? Since the majority of the cohabitations of a wife are with her husband, we can presume that her husband is the father of her children and execute the son based on this presumption.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav once heard a certain housewife ask her friend, “How much milk is required to cook a pound of meat?” On hearing this, Rav enacted in Sura a law prohibiting eating the udder altogether. He also established there an academy that lasted for 800 years.
<br />
<br />
Rami bar Tamrei visited Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur. The people, preparing a pre-Yom Kippur meal, threw the udders into the street, and he collected and ate them. They brought him to Rav Chisda, where the following dialog ensued.
<br />
<br />
Ch: Why did you eat the udders in violation of the local custom?<br />
R: I am from a place of Rav Yehudah, who allows to eat udders.<br />
Ch: But don't you agree to the rule that if you are in a place of a more stringent custom, you don't violate it?<br />
R: I ate them outside the city limit.<br />
Ch: And with what did you roast the udders?<br />
R: With grape pits that I found near a winepress.<br />
Ch: But perhaps they were from wine use for libations?<br />
R: They were older than 12 months and thus permitted for benefit.<br />
Ch: But perhaps they were stolen goods?<br />
R: The owners abandoned them, there were nettles sprouting there.
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda saw that Rami was not wearing tefilin.
<br />
<br />
Ch: Why are you not wearing tefilin?<br />
R: He (that is, I) suffers from stomach ailment.<br />
Ch: And why are not wearing tsitzit fringes?<br />
R: My garment is borrowed.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, they brought a person to be punished with lashes, because he refused to honor his parents. Rami said, “Release him!” There is no punishment for a commandment if a reward for it is mentioned next to it in the Torah. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda relented and said, “I see that you are very sharp.” Rami replied, "If you would be in Rav Yehudah's city, I would show you my sharpness!"

<span style="font-size: medium;">Blood absorbed in the meat of animals is permitted as long as it is not separated from the meat. Thus a it is permitted to eat a peace of raw meat, even though it contains blood. However, once the blood leaves the meat, it becomes prohibited. If it is later re-absorbed into the meat, that meat should not be eaten. Accordingly, meat may not be cooked until its blood has been exacted. There are two methods for exacting blood, by roasting the meat or by salting it. Both methods cause the blood to leave the meat, never to return.
<br />
<br />
The liver, however, is so saturated with blood that salting is ineffective in extracting all of it. Abaye said to Rav Safra, “When you go to the Land of Israel, ask them, what do they do with the liver.” Rav Safra posed the question to Rabbi Zerika, and he related that he himself stewed a liver for Rabbi Asi. Abaye was not satisfied. He said, “I had no doubt that you can cook the liver by itself. Can you cook it with other meats?” Since this was never resolved, people don't cook liver together with other meats.

<span style="font-size: medium;">If fish was roasted on the fire and taken directly from the fire – while still hot – and placed on a clean meat plate, then the fish absorbs the taste of meat, which in turn has been previously absorbed by the plate. The fish is thus removed from direct contact with meat, and its taste of meat is what is called “taste, the son of a taste.” Rav said about this imparted meat taste that this fish should not be eaten with milk products, but Shmuel said that it is permitted.
<br />
<br />
Rav Elazar was once serving Shmuel at a meal, and they brought Shmuel such fish, and he ate it with a sauce made with milk. He offered some to Rav Elazar, who refused. Shmuel then said, “I served it to your teacher, Rav, and he ate!” When Rav Elazar asked Rav about this, Rav said, “Shmuel could not serve me anything forbidden!” Indeed, the law follows Shmuel.
<br />
<br />
By extension, even fish cooked in a meat pot or roasted on a meat spit can be served with dairy foods, although one should not knowingly create such a situation.

<span style="font-size: medium;">Shmuel explained the salting process. To extract blood from the meat, one needs to salt it very well and then rinse it very well. That means covering it with thick salt and leaving it in a vessel for eighteen minutes, but preferably for an hour. Rinsing is needed to remove the salt, the blood, and then another rinsing removes the previous dirty waters. Furthermore, meat being salted should always be in a perforated vessel, so that the blood is not re-absorbed into it. Rav Sheshet would salt each piece of meat individually, but that's too much. For if one suspects that blood from one piece will get absorbed into the other, then he must equally suspect that blood from one side of one piece with get absorbed into the other side.
<br />
<br />
Only meat of a kosher animal with the milk of a kosher animal are forbidden. Rabbi Akiva says that the Torah did not prohibit cooking meat of a wild kosher animal or the meat of a fowl with milk, although he agrees that the Sages later prohibited this as well: the Torah repeated the prohibition thrice to exclude from it the meat of wild animals, non-kosher animals, and fowl.

Chullin 114 – Milk, But Not That of Its Mother
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBVZ1xqiq5UmA2xmLLV5uW5BBUkzxbt_EN0cvnHMyqvxjD_0KVTOaaX8NIju_asUHeYEyJBJNcGGj358UfzzcDppesyJUZh6Sunu6MmRQYskk5E9e21tv0O0hAaBUq2ryhxPCixzlxXHw/s1600/Richard+Ansdell+-+Feeding+Goats+in+the+Alhambra.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBVZ1xqiq5UmA2xmLLV5uW5BBUkzxbt_EN0cvnHMyqvxjD_0KVTOaaX8NIju_asUHeYEyJBJNcGGj358UfzzcDppesyJUZh6Sunu6MmRQYskk5E9e21tv0O0hAaBUq2ryhxPCixzlxXHw/s320/Richard+Ansdell+-+Feeding+Goats+in+the+Alhambra.jpg" width="243" /></a></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">From the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2161">You shall not cook a young goat in the milk of its mother</a>” we only know that it is prohibited to cook it in the milk of a she-goat. How do we know this for the milk of a cow or an ewe? – We can derive this logically: if the young goat's own mother, with whom he can have offspring, is nevertheless so strict that it is prohibited to cook him in its milk, then a cow, with whom he is not allowed to have offspring (for that would be prohibited interbreeding) – her milk certainly cannot be used to cook him!
<br />
<br />
However, this logic is flawed. There is a stringency with the young goat and its mother: they cannot be killed on one day. This stringency is not found in regards to the goat kid and a cow who is a complete stranger to him. Thus, with our logic disproved, we need another way to derive the prohibition – and it is derived from the second repetition of “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2520">don't cook a young goat in its mother milk</a>,” which, his mother being already prohibited, now teaches us the same law about a cow.

Chullin 115 – What To Do With Non-kosher Meat?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Ashi said, “How do we know that the mixture of meat cooked with milk is prohibited for consumption?” After all, the Torah only prohibited cooking. However, since it also said, “You shall not eat any abomination,” it is teaching us that one should distance himself from anything that the Torah considers prohibited, and thus one should not eat such mixture. 
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, from the teaching of Rabbi Abahu we learn not to derive benefit from such mixture. For Rabbi Abahu said, “Any time that the Torah commanded not to eat something, it is prohibited both for food and to derive benefit – unless the benefit was specifically allowed. For example, the Torah said, “Do not eat any animal that died by itself (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>), give to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noahidism">Noahide</a> or sell to a gentile.” Had the Torah not mentioned specifically giving and selling, we would not be allowed to benefit from it - and this teaches us all such cases.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, Rabbi Yehudah requires to gift nevelah to a Noahide, absent that, one can sell it to a gentile. However, Rabbi Meir allows to equally sell or gift it, either to a Noahide, or to a gentile.

Chullin 116 – The Rennet
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijgXsXCibDXR0xEUeONIh0bVizqkBu1Y581NICAu21QzwGX_nt0qOPdFipFEPMmXxh9cXOlb84Nr3p0HMibkPXywTqjpoOb6U4SLTHxm8DOqxJdKbrAr7Ow8oh1QzO8aW_IbXwA20Sjg/s1600/Julien+Dupre+-+The+Milkmaid.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="221" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiijgXsXCibDXR0xEUeONIh0bVizqkBu1Y581NICAu21QzwGX_nt0qOPdFipFEPMmXxh9cXOlb84Nr3p0HMibkPXywTqjpoOb6U4SLTHxm8DOqxJdKbrAr7Ow8oh1QzO8aW_IbXwA20Sjg/s320/Julien+Dupre+-+The+Milkmaid.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">The fourth stomach of the ruminants is called abomasum. Its lining contains an enzyme, called rennin, which, when added to milk, causes it to coagulate into cheese. The congealed milk, found in the abomasum of young nursing ruminants, is called rennet. Sometimes the term “rennet” is used to denote the membrane lining the stomach, and sometimes it refers to rennin.
<br />
<br />
The rennet of an animal of an idolater and of an animal that died of itself (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>) is prohibited for consumption. If one curdles milk with the meat of the abomasum and there is enough meat to impart flavor to the cheese, the cheese is prohibited. If a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> animal suckled from a kosher animal, its rennet is permitted, because it is merely gathered in its innards.
<br />
<br />
There are three different ways to understand the above rules. (1) Both liquid and congealed rennet are not classified as milk but as refuse, thus rennet is always permitted; (2) Both liquid and congealed rennet are classified as milk, thus, it is kosher only when the milk was suckled from a kosher animal; (3) Liquid rennet is viewed as milk; congealed rennet is viewed as refuse.

Chullin 117 – Which is Stricter, Fat or Blood?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgi-hi7JhxhELP42xVvYQedmV71riHwSSMY9Iy5BsVsSW3mjeENlGCyqoPLT2LLcrzjaZ7DI0Wx2uJpt4VXFfSWOnqGCrDuckSAPaMSeSi5K1UBq1_pPkCan5_6NX-zyID49p4wROGEA2g/s1600/Pieter+Aertsen+-+Vendor+Of+Fowl.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgi-hi7JhxhELP42xVvYQedmV71riHwSSMY9Iy5BsVsSW3mjeENlGCyqoPLT2LLcrzjaZ7DI0Wx2uJpt4VXFfSWOnqGCrDuckSAPaMSeSi5K1UBq1_pPkCan5_6NX-zyID49p4wROGEA2g/s320/Pieter+Aertsen+-+Vendor+Of+Fowl.jpg" width="221" /></a></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">Fat and blood are prohibited in the same Torah phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=3#P2793">Any internal fat that is normally sacrificed and any blood you shall not eat</a>.” Both carry an excision penalty if done intentionally and a sin-offering if done by mistake. However, each one has stringencies not found in another.
<br />
<br />
If one benefits from the internal fat of an animal that is a sacrifice, he has committed a misappropriation of the Temple property. If he eats it after it was offerred by the priest with the intention to eat it after the alloted time, or after it was left actually over, or after he became ritually impure – he is liable, which is not the case with blood. That is because blood serves for atonement, and only for atonement, but not for additional transgressions. One does not commit misappropriation with blood, because it is given “to you.”
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the prohibition of eating blood applies to domestic animals, wild animals, and to fowl, whether kosher or non-kosher, but the prohibition of eating the inner fat applies only to kosher domesticated animals.

Chullin 118 – The Hide And The Gravy

<span style="font-size: medium;">Any amount of food can become ritually impure, but to transmit impurity further, it needs to have a volume of at least an egg's volume. This impurity will be only secondary, since intrinsically food does not possess impurity.
<br />
<br />
In contrast, if an animal died by itself, or even if it was killed, but not by the method of shechitah, then its meat is intrinsically impure, and it can contaminate other foods. To be significant, the amount of dead animal's meat must measure at least an olive volume.
<br />
<br />
The following parts of the animal combine with its meat in order to reach the egg's volume, a pre-requisite for the food to transmit impurity: the hide, the gravy, the sediment, the shreds, the bones, the ligaments, the horns, and the hooves. The hide adds up, because it serves as a protector for the meat. The gravy is the juice that exudes from the meat. It is not eaten by itself, but it is eaten with the meat. The same refers to the other parts. However, since they are not really food, they do not add up to the olive's volume, required for the dead animal's meat impurity.

Chullin 119 – Handles And Protectors

<span style="font-size: medium;">Earlier we saw that there can be light and strict impurity. Light impurity is that of foods: it requires the larger volume of an egg to be transmitted, and it can be transmitted only to other foods. Strict impurity is that of dead meat (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>): it requires a smaller volume of an olive to be transmitted, and it can make ritually impure even people and utensils.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, impurity can be transmitted not only through direct contact with the item, but also through contact with its handle or its protector. A handle is an appendage that can be used to grasp the item, such as the stem of a fruit. A protector is an appendage that protects the item, such as the peel of a fruit. 
<br />
<br />
Thus, if the source of impurity touches the stem or peel of a susceptible fruit, impurity is delivered to the fruit via its attached handle or protector, even though they are not food and would not be susceptible to impurity in their own right. Conversely, if the stem or peel of an impure fruit touches a susceptible item, the impurity is delivered to the item via the fruit's handle or protector.

<br />
Rav Dimi then asked, “If one told his agent to go and separate terumah, the kohen's portion, then went to his produce and found the terumah separated, what is the law?” Rav Nachman answered, “He cannot presume that this was done properly.”<br />
<br />
Asked Rav Dimi, what is the difference between the two cases? If one can rely on an agent to accomplish his mission, he should rely on his in all cases. Said Rav Nachman, “When you measure me a kor of salt (about 25 pounds) of salt as my commission, I will explain.” In fact, he cannot presume that his agent did what he was told to do. However, in the case of slaughter, even if another man did it, most who slaughter know the laws. In contrast, the separation of the kohen's portion requires the knowledge of the owner.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">Previously <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/10/chullin-118-hide-and-gravy.html">we learned that gravy combines with meat for the volume of an egg</a>, necessary to convey ritual impurity. Rava said, “Gravy is the fat that rises to the top of meat sauce.” Abbaye said to him, “That would be food in its own right, not only in combination with meat! Rather, it is congealed glaze, which people don't eat by itself, but only with meat.” Why does it have to be congealed? Didn't Resh Lakish say that salad dressing combines with the salad to transgress the fast of Yom Kippur? – That would not be a contradiction: on Yom Kippur all depends on alleviating the affliction of hunger, and the dressing helps that, whereas only congealed glaze combines with foods.
<br />
<br />
If one cooked blood to make it solid and then ate it, or if he dissolved the prohibited fat and then ate that, he is liable. Now, we understand about blood: by his actions he showed that he values it as solid and it has the status of food in his eyes, but the fat is only prohibited to eat, not to drink!? As Resh Lakish explained, the extra word “that soul” prohibits drinking the fat.

<span style="font-size: medium;">When a Jew slaughters a kosher animal, it is considered dead, even while it is convulsing. The Sages later prohibited eating meat from a convulsing animal, but the fact remains that it is already considered food, which makes it susceptible to ritual impurity. Should it, while convulsing, touch a dead lizard, it would acquire the ritual impurity of food.
<br />
<br />
If a Jew slaughters a non-kosher animal, then while it is convulsing, it cannot be eaten by anybody: by a Jew, because it is non-kosher, and by a non-Jew, because slaughter does not make it permitted for him, and he must wait till the animal completely dies. Nevertheless, if a Jew slaughters a non-kosher on behalf of a non-Jew, then, since the Jew's intention is to prepare it as food for the non-Jew, it, too, is susceptible to ritual impurity of foods while it is convulsing. Thus, paradoxically, it cannot be eaten, but it is already considered food. The same would be if a non-Jew slaughters a kosher animal.
<br />
<br />
If one sodomizes a convulsing animal, he is liable, since it is considered partially alive, as proved by the absence of the impurity of dead meat until it dies.

<span style="font-size: medium;">The hide of an animal is normally not considered as flesh, since it is tough and inedible. Therefore, though the meat connected to it may carry the impurity of dead meat (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>), the hide itself does not carry this impurity.
<br />
<br />
In contrast, the skin of the creatures discussed below is treated as their flesh. The first one is that of a human. Thus, the skin of a human corpse conveys corpse impurity. Incidentally, the human skin is prohibited for consumption, like its flesh. Actually, a corpse is prohibited for all benefit.
<br />
<br />
The skin of the domestic pig is soft and is commonly eaten, and is thus treated as flesh, and according to Rabbi Yehudah also the skin of a wild pig. Other skins are: the skin of the hump of a tender camel, the soft skin of the head of a tender calf, the skin of the hooves, the skin of the pudendum, the skin of a fetus, and the skin of the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3024">eight reptiles mentioned in the Torah</a>. 
<br />
<br />
If any of these skins were worked into leather, they become ritually pure, except for human skin. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri does not consider the skin of the  eight reptiles as flesh.

Chullin 123 – Flaying

<span style="font-size: medium;">The hide of an animal, although not in the same category as its flesh, can nevertheless transmit ritual impurity to and from the animal. In the case of a kosher animal, a person might be impure, and he may transmit his impurity to the carcass. In the case of a non-kosher animal, its meat is ritually impure, and it may transmit impurity to the person working with it.
<br />
<br />
If one is flaying a dead animal, whether domestic or wild, kosher or non-kosher, small or large, and his goal is to make a spread out of it, he first cuts the hide from head to hindquarters. The beginning of flaying is the hardest, and until he peels enough hide to grasp the carcass, the hide is considered a handle, and it transmits impurity both ways. If he wants to make a leather flask and strips the hide whole from the neck, the hardest is flaying the breast, so until the breast the hide is considered a handle and it conveys impurity. However, if in flaying for a flask, he begins from the hind legs, then all of the flayed hide is considered a handle, until he flays the breast.

<span style="font-size: medium;">If a hide has an olive's volume of dead meat (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>) attached to it, that piece of meat is ritually impure. If one touches it through a sliver attached to it, the sliver acts as a handle and transmits impurity to the person. A hair on the other side of the hide is regarded as a protector to the meat and transmits impurity from it, since it goes through the hide.
<br />
<br />
If there were two half-olive volumes of meat attached to the hide, they add up when they are carried, and thus transmit impurity to the one who carries the hide. However, if one touches them, even at the same time, he does not become impure, because these are two separate acts of contact – these are the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says that the two half-olive volumes of meat are nullified by the hide and do not transmit impurity at all. That is because through his actions of separating meat from the hide, the butcher showed that he does not consider the pieces significant. Even Rabbi Akiva agrees that if one stuck the two pieces of meat on a splinter and moved them, he becomes impure.

<span style="font-size: medium;">If one touches a marrow bone of a human corpse, he receives the impurity of the dead body. Actually, that is true even if the bone does not contain marrow, but since the rules below will mention specifically marrow bones, our teacher (Tanna) chose to start with it, for symmetry.  As little as a barley-corn of a human bone transmits impurity. This impurity requires the ashes of the red heifer and two immersions in the mikvah, for the person to be purified.
<br />
<br />
The bone marrow of a sacrifice that became a leftover also conveys impurity. In contrast to the impurity of the human bone, this impurity is decreed by the Sages. They wanted the priests to be alacritous in their duties and eat the sacrifices on time, not leaving them over. They also wanted to prevent the priests from taking personal revenge on the people by bringing their sacrifices with the wrong intent of eating them beyond allotted time – and intent that would ruin the sacrifice. The Sages thus decreed impurity on the hand of the priests for these violations, which would deter them, since they would not be able to continue their service for the day.

<span style="font-size: medium;">The Torah <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3024">lists eight special reptiles</a>, such as lizard and snail, and it also includes other small animals in the list, such as weasel and mouse, calling them the collective name of “crawlers,” but we will refer to them for simplicity as reptiles.
<br />
<br />
As a rule, a “protector” of a substance conveys impurity, but only when the substance itself is accessible to touch. For example, an egg of a reptile in which an embryo has been formed is pure and does not convey impurity, because the embryo is not accessible to touch. On the other hand, if the eggshell is punctured even a small amount, it does convey impurity.
<br />
<br />
There was a species of a mouse that does not reproduce sexually but is generated spontaneously from the earth, much as maggots from decaying food. If this mouse died while it was halfway formed, with one side of it flesh and the other still earth, one who touches the flesh of it is impure, but one who touches the earth of it is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says, “One who touches the earth opposite the flesh is also impure.”

Chullin 127 - “Dangling” Limb and Flesh

<span style="font-size: medium;">A “limb” consists of meat, sinews, and bones, whereas “flesh” is meat without sinews and bones. When these are completely severed from a living animal, both are forbidden to be eaten. The difference between them is that the limb is a source of impurity which it can transmit to others, while the flesh is only food, albeit forbidden, so it can receive impurity but does not generate it.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/09/chullin-73-dangling-limb.html">If a limb or flesh is mostly severed from an animal but not completely, they are called “dangling.”</a> In this state, they are ready to receive the food impurity, however, as with all foods, they must first be “prepared” for it by becoming wet. If the animal is then slaughtered, the blood of the slaughtered is considered to have prepared them, even if it did not touch them.
<br />
<br />
If the animal dies without kosher slaughter, the dangling limb or flesh are considered to have been separated from it a moment prior to the animal's death. Consequently, the flesh received no impurity from the carcass, having had no contact with it, while the limb is prohibited as a limb from a live animal.

<span style="font-size: medium;">Normally, food can become ritually impure only if it has ever previously been wet. Can the act of slaughter be considered as making the meat wet and thus ready for ritual impurity? Consider the case of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/09/chullin-73-dangling-limb.html">dangling limb</a>. The slaughter of an animal prepares its dangling limb for food impurity – that is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, but Rabbi Shimon disagrees. There are six possible reasons for their disagreement.
<br />
<br />
1. Can the animal itself be considered a handle for the dangling limb? If it can, it prepares the limb for impurity.<br />
2. Since one cannot lift the animal by its dangling limb, are they considered really connected? If yes, slaughter prepares for impurity.<br />
3. All agree that a handle transmits impurity, but does it also transmit preparation for impurity?<br />
4. At the time of the slaughtered nobody planned to eat the prohibited limb, and afterwards they decided to feed it to someone who disregards the prohibition. Is this effective?<br />
5. If only the last moment of the cut accomplished slaughters, then wiping blood on the limb during slaughtered does not prepare it.<br />
6. If the blood does not touch the limb, is it still considered as if it did?<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">One day Rabbi Assi did not go to the study hall. Afterwards, he met Rabbi Zeira and asked him, “What was said in the study hall?” Rabbi Zeira answered, “And what's your problem?” Rabbi Assi said, “We learned that if one first has a thought to eat a piece of meat, and then cuts it off a limb severed from a live animal, that piece of meat accepts ritual impurity of foods. But why? It was not prepared for impurity by becoming wet!” However, Rabbi Assi was missing another principle: “If something can acquire a severe impurity that can even make people impure, it does not need preparation to become impure itself.” 
<br />
<br />
The limb or flesh that are dangling from a living person are ritually pure: since the person is still alive, they are considered part of him. If he dies, the flesh is pure, but the limb conveys impurity as a limb from a live person, not a dead person. What's the difference, if both have the impurity of the dead? In the first case, a small piece of flesh from this limb does not convey impurity, but in the second it does.

Indeed, we learned that if one threw a knife to plunge it into the wall, and as the  knife went in flight, it slaughtered the animal in a proper way, Rabbi Nathan says that it is a valid shechitah. But, for a short knife one needs to move his knife back and forth!? – In this case also, the knife rebounded from the wall and completed the slaughter.<br />
<br />
A non-Jew does not need to eat kosher meat. Since the Torah said, “And you shall slaughter... and you may eat,” one who does not need to eat kosher meat cannot slaughter it either. Therefore, if he did slaughter it, the animal becomes a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>, same as if it died by itself, and its meat conveys ritual impurity, which was important when the Temple was standing. It is not, however, prohibited for benefit – as would be the case with idol sacrifices – because today's idolaters are considered idol-worshipers by rote, and not out of ideological conviction.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">The foreleg, jaws, and abomasum of a slaughtered animal are a portion of a kohen; <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=18#P5382">one should separate them and give them to the kohen of his choice</a>. This law is called “the law of gifts.” It does not depend upon land, and therefore should apply inside of the Land of Israel and outside, whether the Temple is standing or not. However, in practice people follow the more lenient opinion of Rabbi Ilai.
<br />
<br />
The law of the gifts applies to regular animals but not to consecrated ones. Actually, one could decide that it does apply to the consecrated animals, with the following “a fortiori” argument: since unconsecrated animals, which are not subject to the law of breast and thigh – which must be, in the case of peace offering, given to the kohen and his family to eat – are nevertheless subject to the law of gifts, then consecrated animal, which are subject to the law of breast and thigh, must surely be subject to the law of gifts! To dispel this notion, the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7#P2911">I have given them (breast and thighs) as gifts</a>" – meaning, only “them” but not the foreleg, jaw, and abomasum.

<span style="font-size: medium;">We learned that the foreleg, jaw, and abomasum of a slaughtered animal are a kohen's portion and should be given to him. However, Rav Chisda said that if one damages or eats these gifts, he does not have to pay. That is because the Torah said “This shall be his due” - meaning, only while “this” due is extant. The Talmud  challenges Rav Chisda's ruling seven times, but Rav Chisda defends it each and every time.
<br />
<br />
For example, if a person of means runs out of funds while in travel, he is allowed to take the poor people's portion, that is, grain that fell, was forgotten, or remained at the corners of a field and was designated by the Torah for the poor. Still, when he comes back home, he needs to send the money to the poor people of that place, in order to repay them. By the same token, one should repay the kohen for his gifts that he damaged or ate!? Rav Chisda answers that to repay the poor is a decent act, but not a requirement, and the same goes for the kohen's gift.

Chullin 132 – Gifts for the Daughter of a Kohen
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">Ulla used to give kohen's gifts to a kohenet – a daughter of a kohen. Why? When the Torah told to give the gifts to a kohen, we understand that a kohenet is excluded. However, when it said the word “kohen” again, this is a double exclusion, which always means an inclusion, and a kohenet is now included. Rav Pappa was married to a kohenet, and people would bring him kohen's gifts.
<br />
<br />
A first male of kosher animal is normally given to a kohen. If one firstborn became mingled with a hundred animals belonging to different people, and each owner slaughters his animal, nobody gives kohen's gifts.  Each owner can claim that it is he who is slaughtering the firstborn, and kohen's gifts are not applicable to his animal. Even though the majority of the animals are obligated in kohen's gifts, in money matters we do not follow the majority, but the prevailing rule is that one who wants to extract money from his fellow needs to bring a proof to his claim, and here the kohen looses. However, if one  person slaughters all of the animals, he needs to give kohen's gifts from all but one animal.

Chullin 133 – Which Kohen Gets the Gifts
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">The kohanic gifts, such as the foreleg, must be eaten roasted and with mustard, like kings usually eat, since the Torah gave them “for greatness.” Alternatively, one eats them in any manner he likes, again, like kings. Rav Chisda said, “Any kohen who does not know the laws of all twenty-four kohanic gifts (like the one just stated) is not given the gifts.” But we learned that any kohen who does not accept the kohanic services should not be given gifts, so his acceptance is the criteria, not his knowledge?! – With this, Rav Chisda is disproved.
<br />
<br />
Abaye, who was a kohen, said, “At first I would grab the gifts, to show love for the mitzva. Once I learned the phrase 'the owner will give', I understood that it is improper to grab, and started asking for them instead. After I learned that the sons of Shmuel 'turned aside after monetary gain' by asking for their portion, I would only take if given. When I learned about the Bread of Vision that the discreet kohanim would withdraw their hands, and only gluttons took, I do not even take, except on the day before Yom Kippur, to remind the people that I am a kohen.”

Chullin 134 – The Owner of the Cow Converted
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">If someone converted to Judaism and he owned a cow, then if the cow was slaughtered before he converted, he is exempt from giving kohen's gifts from that cow, and if the cow was slaughtered after his conversion, he is obligated to give them.  If it is uncertain which came first, he is exempt – because the burden of proof of ownership falls on the kohen who cannot prove it with certainty.
<br />
<br />
What exactly constitutes the foreleg given to a kohen? – From the carpus (knee) to the shoulder blade. The foreleg of a nazir's offering, coming from a ram, which is cooked and waved, is defined the same way. So is that portion of the hind leg which is given to a kohen from  each peace offering. Rabbi Yehudah says that only the middle part of the thigh is given to a kohen. 
<br />
<br />
What is a jaw? The portion that extends from the joint of the jaw to the opening of the trachea, and the tongue is included with it. Actually both jaws are meant. The kohanim merited the gifts because of Pinchas, who threw the spear with his right arm, and prayed with his jaws.

Chullin 135 - The First of the Fleece
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1TeAiE7ljIRWnIHjc44ANXNAs62HHznJ2VC0Ys1HtKDhzE5OYkBTy7R345nuuelQOL665ZFwp9aEik_t1VfAiQ7TDSAvslmtq0e1EfCU-JK_Nylm2AouKBNjQFl5u_8uzTLLbkQdUHYw/s1600/John+Frederick+Tayler+-+Sheep+Shearing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1TeAiE7ljIRWnIHjc44ANXNAs62HHznJ2VC0Ys1HtKDhzE5OYkBTy7R345nuuelQOL665ZFwp9aEik_t1VfAiQ7TDSAvslmtq0e1EfCU-JK_Nylm2AouKBNjQFl5u_8uzTLLbkQdUHYw/s320/John+Frederick+Tayler+-+Sheep+Shearing.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">Another gift given to a kohen is the first of the fleece. Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=18#P5383">And the first of the fleece of your flock you shall give to him (the kohen),</a>” whenever one shears his sheep, he must give part of the fleece to a kohen. This mitzvah is not connected to land, and thus applies both inside of Israel and outside. It also applies whether the Temple is standing or not. However, since the Torah said “your flock”, we understand that the flock of the Temple is not included, and thus one does not give to a kohen fleece from sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
The previously discussed gifts of foreleg, jaw, and abomasum are more stringnent in that they apply to sheep and cows, whether many or few. In contrast, the first of the fleece only applies to a flock of sheep, and to a significant shearing.  What is a flock? Two sheep according to Bait Shammai, and five sheep according to Bait Hillel. What is a significant shearing? Rabbi Dosa says, “Five sheep each giving one-and-a-half maneh of wool, which amounts to eight pounds,” but the Sages say, “Five sheep shorn in any amount.”

Chullin 136 - Kohen's Gifts According to Rabbi Ilai
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh65FQSTHJGq5kuNA2jckLUaYTWlTSFNnhGLTczCdx4MWldK-8zZeC0H5djOZW3vwCil3neXyTHq58qA0FIc_aOUGyZyrlYWiqFhVpn0LPj_TDWEmfz2Nd-AescoV-YdUB_YxIGSv1AItc/s1600/George+Lambert+-+Weighing+The+Fleece.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="245" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh65FQSTHJGq5kuNA2jckLUaYTWlTSFNnhGLTczCdx4MWldK-8zZeC0H5djOZW3vwCil3neXyTHq58qA0FIc_aOUGyZyrlYWiqFhVpn0LPj_TDWEmfz2Nd-AescoV-YdUB_YxIGSv1AItc/s320/George+Lambert+-+Weighing+The+Fleece.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">When the Torah say “your” in singular, it refers both to each individual Jew, and to the whole Jewish people. Therefore, the law it discusses applies to an individual as well as to a partnership. For example, when it says, “The first of your (singular) fleece give to a kohen,” this applies also to sheep of partners. Rabbi Ilai disagrees and holds that “your” in singular refers to an individual, but partners shearing their flock need not give the first fleece to a kohen.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, in talking about the first of the fleece, the Torah uses the word “give,” and the same word is used in describing the kohen's portion of the grain. This, according to Rabbi Ilai, tells us that just as the kohen's portion of grain is given only in Israel, so too the first fleece is given only in Israel.
<br />
<br />
Finally, the same word "give" is used in describing kohen's gifts. And, just as the kohen's portion of the grain is given only in Israel, it should follow that according to Rabbi Ilai, the kohen's gifts are given only in Israel. Rabbi Yose said, “Indeed, that is the opinion of Rabbi Ilai.”

Chullin 137 – First Fleece – Only Wool of Sheep, not of Goats

<span style="font-size: medium;">We learned that the&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/11/chullin-135-first-of-fleeceanother-gift.html">kohen's gifts</a>&nbsp;are strict: they apply to all animals, many or few, while the first fleece is more lenient. But there is yet another stringency: kohen's gifts do not apply to a sick animal (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>), why is this not mentioned? – Because the author of our ruling is Rabbi Shimon, who says that the first fleece also does not apply to sheep that are terefah either –  because the Torah used the same word “give” here and in discussing animal tithe; the tithed animal “walks under the rod” and terefah sometimes cannot walk.
<br />
<br />
The first fleece is given to a kohen only from sheep, because the word "shearing" used by the Torah only applies to sheep, and goat hair is “plucked.” This meaning of the word "shearing" becomes clear from the book of Job: “from the fleece of my sheep he warmed himself.”
<br />
<br />
“Any amount” of fleece that the Sages require to be given to a kohen was only said in contrast to Rabbi Yose's eight pounds, but really they mean about five times less than that, and there are four opinions about their opinion.

<span style="font-size: medium;">If one buys a fleece of a flock, then if he left any fleece with the seller, the seller is obligated to give the first fleece, and if he bought it all – he is obligated. Why should it be, it seems to make no difference if he left any or not!? Really, the obligation of the first fleece is always with the original owner.  If he is left with some fleece, it is clear that he kept it so that he can give it to a kohen.  If he sold all of it, we assume that he simply means that  the buyer will give the kohen’s portion, acting as his agent.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=22#P5471">If one chances upon a bird’s nest, with a mother bird sitting on the eggs or on the young, he should not take the mother with the young, but he should send her away</a>. The somewhat similar commandment of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/09/chullin-84-mitzvah-to-cover-blood.html">covering the blood</a> is stricter: it applies to wild animals and birds, whether the birds are prepared or not, while sending away the mother bird applies only to birds, and only if they are "not prepared," but come your way by chance, not like chicken that nested in one's house.

<span style="font-size: medium;">Sending away the mother bird does not apply to sacrifices. However, how could this case occur? If one consecrated birds that are his, he was never obligated to send away their mother, because he needs to find the birds by chance. And if he found them and consecrated, they do not become consecrated, because they do not belong to him! Should we say that he lifted the chicks and consecrated them, then returned them to the nest? Then again he is not obligated to send away the mother bird.
<br />
<br />
Rav said, “The case is where he consecrated the birds, but they flew away, and he found them,” and Shmuel said “He consecrated his hen as money for the Temple, and it flew away and nested elsewhere.” It is understandable why Shmuel does not agree to Rav, because Shmuel’s explanation is wider in scope, but why does Rav not agree to Shmuel? Rav will say that when a hen flies away, its monetary sanctity disappears. And Shmuel? He will answer that the hen is still consecrated in the wild, because “To God belong the earth and its fullness.”

<br />
If one slaughtered an animal on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, even though he incurs punishment for the violation, his slaughter is valid and the animal's meat is fit for consumption. Said Rav, “Even though the meat is kosher, it may not be eaten until the end of Shabbat.” Why? Following Rabbi Yehudah, we say that the animal was not designated for food before the Shabbat. Since it was not thus prepared for use, it should not be used as food. However, why don't we say that animals are designated for food, although they are also designated for growth. If later on they are slaughtered, it is now retroactively clarified that they were originally from those designated for food? – No, we cannot say so, because Rabbi Yehudah does not agree with the principle of retroactive designation, also called breirah.<br />

The Torah used a special word for “bird” – “tzippor,” which is used only for kosher birds.<br />
<br />
If a nonkosher bird is sitting on eggs of a kosher bird, or vice versa, one does not have to send her away. Now, we understand the nonkosher bird case – it is non-kosher, as we just learned, even if it sits on kosher eggs, but what’s the problem with the kosher bird on nonkosher eggs? – The Torah said “and the young you will take for yourself”  and here, since they are nonkosher, you can only take them for someone else.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Rabbi Yirmiyah asked, “If the bird sits on unattached feathers which are on the eggs, is it considered sitting on the eggs or no, and does one have to send her way?" – No answer was found. Male partridges characteristically sit on  other birds’ eggs, does one have to send him away? Rabbi Eliezer indeed says “yes,” but the Sages say “no.”<br />

Chullin 141 – How To Send The Mother Bird Away

This is derived from the special word for sitting, “rovetzet” that the Torah used, literally, crouching.<br />
<br />
If there were fledgling chicks in the nest  or infertile eggs, he does not send the mother bird away. The chicks must be like the eggs, dependent on their mother, and the eggs  like the chicks, viable.

If one sent the mother bird away and she returned, he is still obligated to send her away, any number of times.<br />
<br />
If one violated the commandment and took the mother bird, he incurs lashes, like for any negative commandment – these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. However, the Sages say that he does not incur lashes, because of a general rule: any negative commandment , if it is followed a positive commandment can be corrected with this positive act. Here too, the Torah said, “Do not take the mother… send her away,” so sending her away afterwards helps.<br />

Chullin 142 – Reward for the Mitzvot

This is true even though he wants to send her away as part of the purification ritual. By sending the bird away he loses a small amount of money, and still the Torah promised “that it will be good for you and you will live long.” How much more so does this apply to the difficult commandments of the Torah.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yakov said that “good and long life” can only mean the next world, not this one. In fact, the mention of the reward is itself a proof of the resurrection of the dead, because only in the next world is the true reward possible. For if you don’t say so, what about a son whom his father asked to send away the mother bird, and while performing this mitzvah and respecting his parent, for which long life is promised, he fell from the tree and died?<br />
<br />
But perhaps such an incident could never happen? – Rabbi  Yakov saw it. But perhaps he had bad thoughts? – God does not count bad thoughts as deeds. But perhaps he was thinking about idol worship, where thoughts are counted as deeds? – The mitzvahs should have protected him from such thoughts. Since they did not, this proves that there is no reward for them in this world.
<br />
<br />
But how could he die while performing a mitzvah; those sent to perform a mitzvah are not harmed, even on the way back!? – The ladder was shaky, and in a place of danger this rule does not work. Acher, the famous Sage turned bad, was the grandfather of Rabbi Yakov. Had he heard his grandson’s explanation, he might not have sinned: "so that it will be good with you" refers to a world that is truly good, and “so that your days will be prolonged” refers to life in a world that is truly long.

<br />
Why would Rav silence someone? Could it be because Rav subscribes to the view of Rabbi Yehudah, who only allows to eat this food after Shabbat, whereas the student recited the view of Rabbi Meir, who allows to eat it immediately? – No! This cannot be. Just because Rav himself does not agree to someone's point of view, he would never silence a person reciting it, since it was a logically valid opinion held by Rabbi Meir. Rather, Rav silenced him because he misunderstood Rabbi Meir's point of view. He actually recited the rule as applicable to slaughter. Said Rav to him, “Do not think that Rabbi Meir allows to eat meat slaughtered on Shabbat, just as he allows to eat cooked food. For the food could be eaten even uncooked, but the animal could not be eaten if not slaughtered.”<br />

Chullin 16 – Slaughter With a Sharpened Reed

If one slaughters with the smooth side of a sickle, his shechitah is valid. If he slaughters with a sharpened piece of flint or with a sharpened reed, his slaughter is also valid.<br />
<br />
“If one slaughters” implies that one really should not, but if he did, it is valid. Why? This is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who invalidates the slaughter done by an implement attached to the ground. If it was detached, and then later reattached, then Rabbi Yehudah asks not to use it, but if it was used anyway, he considers the shechitah valid.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chiya always permits the shechitah done with something that is attached to the ground. Once Rav and Rabbi Chiya were sitting in a lecture of Rabbi Yehudah who said, “How do we know that shechitah must be done with a detached implement? – Because it is written, '<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=22">And Abraham took the knife to slaughter his son</a>.'”<br />
<br />
Said Rabbi Chiya, “This proof is as full of cracks as a letter vav written on a piece of a tree trunk. Abraham was zealous and brought a knife. But in truth anything sharp on the mountaintop would do.”<br />

Chullin 17 – They Should Always Do Shechitah

<br />
“We always slaughter” according to Rabbi Ishmael, means this. In the desert, the Jews were not allowed to eat meat for pleasure, but only if brought as a peace offering. When they entered the Land of Israel, the Torah allowed them to eat meat whenever they wanted, even if not brought as a sacrifice. You might think that in exile the meat is again prohibited – so the rule teaches that it remains allowed. According to Rabbi Akiva, meat eaten for pleasure was always permitted, but the shechitah in the desert was not required. In Israel shechitah became obligatory. You might think that in exile the shechitah requirement is again not applicable, just like in the desert beforehand, so the rule teaches you otherwise – that now the shechitah is always needed.<br />

It needs be examined using the flesh and the nail of a finger. In addition, the appointed slaughterer needs to show his knife for inspection to the local Sage, as a way of expressing the honor due the Sage.<br />
<br />
The correct place for the slaughter cut is the front of the neck of the animal, and the knife should cut more than half of the trachea and esophagus. The trachea itself is encircled by many successive rings of cartilage, which are horseshoe shaped. The uppermost ring is a complete ring, and it forms the upper limit of the cut. If he cut above the upper ring, the shechitah is not kosher. Rabbi Yose ben Yehudah says that as long as he cut the major part of the trachea within the upper ring, it is valid, even if the knife went higher in the remaining part of the cut. Rabbi Chanina ben Antignos testified that even if he cut above the uppermost ring, but still under the thyroid, it is valid, and his is the accepted point of view.<br />

<br />
Why would it be kosher? Because when the animal's life departs in the middle of the cut, it departs through valid shechitah. And why would it be not kosher? Because you need the majority of the trachea cut within the designated area, and here only one-third of it was cut this way.<br />
<br />
In the reverse case, Rav Huna and Rabbi Yehudah again disagreed, and Rav Yehudah became upset. On hearing this, Rav Huna wanted to retract his opinion, because Rav Yehudah was the direct student of Rav, while Rav Huna only heard Rav's opinion through others. Said Rav Chisda to him, "Don't retract both opinions, for they are logical, just retract that one which you did not hear directly from Rav." Thus, you will combine logic and your respect for tradition the reason for which may escape you.<br />

It consists of cutting through the majority of the animal's trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (food pipe). This cutting is subject to a number of laws: it must be done from the front of the neck, in a continuous slicing stroke, and with a smooth blade.<br />
<br />
All may do slaughter, and their slaughter is valid, except for a deaf-mute, a deranged person, and a minor – lest they bungle their slaughtering. But if any of these slaughtered with others watching over them, their slaughter is still valid. A minor is a boy before bar mitzvah, or  a girl before bat mitzvah.<br />
<br />
However, the teacher seems to be of two minds by allowing the slaughter upfront, and then validating it after the fact. According to Rabbah bar Ulla, this is talking about slaughtering regular meat on the level of purity required for sacrifices, since there were people who used to do that. Even a ritually impure person can perform this slaughter, provided that he uses a long knife and does not touch the meat, although initially he should not do it.<br />
<br />
The Talmud will give five more possible explanations.<br />

While shechitah is done from the front of the neck, the melikah is done from the back of it. Therefore we have the following rules.<br />
<br />
If one performs shechitah from the side of the neck, it is valid, but if one performs melikah from the side of the neck, it is invalid. If one performs shechitah from the back of the neck, it is invalid, but if he performs melikah from the back of the neck, it is the proper way to do it. Finally, if one performs shechitah from the throat, it is valid, but if he performs melikah that way, it is invalid.<br />
<br />
We thus find that the complete back of the neck is valid for melikah, and the complete front and the sides are valid for shechitah, and what is fit for melikah is unfit for shechitah and vice versa. <br />

Therefore, it carries spiritual impurity as a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah, more so than a correctly slaughtered animal</a>, which, although it may have been sick and thus not kosher, still does not carry spiritual impurity.<br />
<br />
Said Rav Chisda, “We already learned this! If one did melikah to the bird with a knife instead of his fingernail, the bird becomes a nevelah. That is exactly the case of Zeiri, where the bird's neck is broken before it is slaughtered.”  They told him, “No, Zeiri's rule is new and necessary! In the case of the bird, melikah - killing the bird from the back of the neck - is not considered shechitah at all, but the case of an animal whose neck is broken it might have be different.”<br />
<br />
And why is melikah not considered a valid shechitah? Rav Huna said, “Because one burrows the knife under the neck bone,” and Rav said, “Because he presses the knife downwards.” These are two of the five invalidations of shechitah.<br />

Chullin 22 – Which Birds Are Fit For Sacrifices
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPxW38uzIarsA_Okz-p0B4Q5E5LAQFw5fm1pogcO8zu_FTEoN640TIqX_aqwWiJR4ufPqXU2FjYEVGBp3KbJZWaNsn_FWR9dSP_zleF7_HP5jNjTQsJQ_-bXUXzUkF-sNjXwjeqPoX478/s1600/James+E.+Bourhill+-+Pouter+Pigeons.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="228" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPxW38uzIarsA_Okz-p0B4Q5E5LAQFw5fm1pogcO8zu_FTEoN640TIqX_aqwWiJR4ufPqXU2FjYEVGBp3KbJZWaNsn_FWR9dSP_zleF7_HP5jNjTQsJQ_-bXUXzUkF-sNjXwjeqPoX478/s320/James+E.+Bourhill+-+Pouter+Pigeons.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The only two species of birds mentioned in the Torah which can be offered as sacrifices are the turtledove and the pigeon. Turtledoves are migratory birds, but pigeons dwell permanently in the land. A turtledove must be mature to be fit for  a sacrifice, but a pigeon is acceptable only before it reaches maturity. We therefore have the following rules.<br />
<br />
What is acceptable in the case of turtledoves is unacceptable in the case of pigeons, and vice versa. The beginning of yellowing in both types is unacceptable. That is when a turtledove is not fully mature yet, and a pigeon begins to become mature. The reason for this is that the Torah calls pigeons “bnei yonah,” “sons of pigeons”; conversely, we understand that turtledoves must be mature.<br />
<br />
But logic should dictate otherwise: if turtledoves, which are not acceptable when young, are acceptable when mature, then pigeons, which are acceptable when young, should surely be acceptable when old! To dispel this, the Torah never called a pigeon a pigeon, but only a “son of a pigeon” to emphasize that only young ones are acceptable.<br />

Rabbi Zeira asked, “Is this for sure or out of doubt?” Meaning, if one promised a bird burnt offering and then brought a turtledove and a pigeon with yellowing feathers, is at least one of them valid, or, because it is a bird in a class by itself, neither is valid?<br />
<br />
Try this answer: the Torah said “sacrifices … from birds,” and this means that some birds are excluded. Which ones? Isn't it ones with yellowing feathers? - No! Excluded are <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/02/zevachim-85-these-must-be-removed-from.html">birds that were sodomized</a> or worshiped, and Rabbi Zeira does not get an answer.<br />
<br />
He asked a similar question about sheep. A sheep younger than twelve months is a lamb, one older than thirteen is a ram, what is its status in between? Does it require libations like either a lamb or  a ram, or is it a separate creature with no libations? Again, no answer. He also asked about dough in intermediate stages of leavening, can it be brought as part of a thanksgiving offering.<br />

The decapitated calf was a needed when a dead body was found in the Land of Israel: the Sages of the nearby town would kill the calf by breaking its neck from the back. Therefore we have a rule: “What is valid for the red heifer is invalid for the decapitated calf, and vice versa.”<br />
<br />
What is fit for the kohanim is unfit for the Leviim, and vice versa. The kohanim were disqualified by blemishes, but they could serve at any age. In contrast, the Leviim were not disqualified by blemishes, but they had age limitations: they would start studies at 25 and continue on to service at 30. They  retired at 50.<br />
<br />
The service of the Leviim included guarding the gates, singing in the Temple choir and playing in the Temple orchestra. From them we have a rule that any student who does not see success in the first five years of his studies will never see it. Some say that at this point he should try Kabbalah.<br />

If a dead lizard is inside a clay pot, even not touching it, the pot is impure, but if it touches the outside, the pot remains pure. The opposite is true of other utensils.<br />
<br />
How do we know this highly unusual law of earthenware utensils? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11">an earthenware utensil into whose interior one of the eight dead reptiles will fall … will become impure</a>” - even if the reptile does not touch it. It also said,“<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=19">any open utensil under the same roof with a dead body, if it does not have a cover, will become impure</a>”, to teach that if it does have a cover, it remains pure and protects from impurity – even if it is touched from the outside.<br />
<br />
What is pure in the case of wooden utensils is impure in the case of metal utensils, and vice versa. Wooden utensils can be used before they are fully finished, and are thus susceptible to impurity. However, if they lack a hollow of any kind, they remain pure. The reverse is true of metal utensils.<br />

<br />
Why from the neck? Said Rav Kahana, the word “shechitah” says it: “shach” means something that bends, that is the neck, and “chat” means to prepare. But the tail also bends, so perhaps we should cut from the tail? - No, the tail is already bent, and we need something that bends occasionally. But perhaps we should cut from the ear, because it sometimes bends? - No, we need the lifeblood, and it does not go from the ear. Still, how would we know the five disqualifications of the shechitah, which are pausing, pressing, burrowing, cutting beyond and tearing? - We are forced to conclude that cutting from the neck was taught to Moses on Sinai and is not based on a word in the Torah.<br />
<br />
Rav Yeimar said, the word slaughter, “zavach” means to cut where it (the blood) flows (“zav”). But perhaps we should cut from the nose, from which mucus flows? - No, mucus always flows, and blood – only when cut. <br />

Granted, if the bird dies by itself or from a blow to a part of its body, it does become a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a> and may not be eaten. However, one can kill the bird by tearing or piercing its pipes, and that would be sufficient. The hint to this in the Torah is found in the requirement to <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=17">cover the blood of a killed bird</a>, – meaning, covering the blood is all that is required. <br />
<br />
Objection to the statement of Rabbi Yitzchak! We learned a rule that “If one was doing the shechitah, and inadvertently rendered it a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>, or if he pierces or tears the creature's pipes, he does not have to cover the blood. We see from here that piercing is not considered shechitah, to the extent that even blood covering is not required! What will Rabbi Yitzchak answer? He says that this rule is only about a wild animal - <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=17">since covering the blood is also required for a wild animal</a> - and not about a bird.<br />

<br />
An objection against Rav comes from the laws of purity. If one split a ritually impure earthenware oven into two pieces, ostensibly of the same size – they both remain impure, because it is impossible to be precise in anything, and any of the two pieces might be the larger one. However, if it were possible to be precise, the pieces would be pure! But, according to Rav, exactly half is considered like more than half, and thus the pieces should remain impure, which proves that Rav is wrong! Said Rav Pappa in Rav's defense, in an oven both pieces cannot be the larger ones, but in slaughter we care only about the part that is cut.<br />
<br />
In the end the Rav's point of view is revised as untenable, and instead we say that the argument is not about shechitah, but about half of all Jews being impure on Passover.<br />

If he eats non-kosher meat to satisfy his appetite or to save money, but will eat kosher meat when it is available, then if he is handed a sharpened knife that was properly examined and found free of nicks, he will presumably not squander the opportunity to make the meat kosher. However, if he does not have an examined knife, then he cannot be trusted, for he will not bother to sharpen it. If he went ahead and slaughtered with his knife – which he should not have done – one can examine the knife afterwards, and if the knife was found to be fine, one can eat from his shechitah.<br />
<br />
Ravina said that “all” refers to those who take upon themselves to do shechitah, because most of them know the laws – provided that they already did shechitah a few times without fainting. Even if it is their first time and they do shechitah without supervision – which they should not have done – if they later say that they did not faint, their slaughter is valid.<br />

For example, if someone started the shechitah while outside the Temple and completed it inside, then according to Rabbi Yochanan he is liable for bringing sacrifices outside the Temple, since from the beginning of the cut he was already doing the shechitah. According to Resh Lakish, he is not liable, since only the end of shechitah is significant, and that happened inside.<br />
<br />
Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav, “If one severs the pipe in two or three places, his slaughter is valid.” But when he repeated this teaching in front of Shmuel, Shmuel said it was invalid. A defense for Rav: as we will learn later, two people can hold a knife and together make a shechitah to an animal. This proves that you can make two cuts! Answers Shmuel, “No! They are holding the same knife together and cutting. We need a clearly visible single cut.” <br />

Chullin 31 – Shechitah Must Be Done With A Sawing Motion

Therefore, if he cut the head off with one motion, it is valid – provided that the knife was twice as long as the neck, so that he can accomplish the cut without going back and forth. If he used the back-and-forth motion, it is valid, and then the knife can be as small as a scalpel. If he cut off two animal heads in one motion, it is valid, provided that the knife is thrice as long as one neck. Two people can do a shechitah together, as long as they don't press.<br />
<br />
Rava examined an arrow for Rav Yonah, found it smooth, and then Rav Yonah slaughtered with it a bird in flight. But perhaps the arrow entered the side of the neck and burrowed between the pipes? - They saw that the feathers around the neck were sliced. But they need to cover the blood of the bird both below and above? - They plowed the whole field over which the bird was flying, and thus the loose earth served for covering below.<br />

Chullin 32 – Pause During Shechitah

The same applies to a case where he had to sharpen the knife, or where he grew weak while doing the shechitah, and his companion finished it for him. Rabbi Shimon says, the pause should not be longer than what it takes to examine the knife.<br />
<br />
If in doing the shechitah one properly severed the trachea, but tore the esophagus with a nicked knife, then Rabbi Yesheivav says that the animal becomes a nevelah – not slaughtered at all – and therefore carries ritual impurity. Rabbi Akiva says that the animal becomes a trefah: it is slaughtered, but considered to have an internal defect that would cause it to die within a year. Trefah cannot be eaten, but it does not carry ritual impurity.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yesheivav stated a rule: any animal that became unfit through slaughter becomes a nevelah, but if another incidental defect caused it to become unfit, it becomes trefah, and subsequently Rabbi Akiva agreed to it.<br />

Chullin 33 – Blood of Shechitah and Ritual Impurity

In addition, the owner of the food must be content with it becoming wet. Thus, washing the fruit would qualify, while the fruit falling into the water would not.<br />
<br />
The slaughter of an animal produces blood, and the owner of the animal is content with it, thus blood prepared the animal to become ritually impure. However, we have a rule that states “if one slaughtered a domesticated animal, a wild kosher animal, or a bird,  and blood did not come out of them, they are kosher. We do not assume that the animal died just prior to shechitah. It may be eaten with unwashed hands.”<br />
<br />
Unwashed hands are considered ritually impure. But why should this rule be true? It cannot be talking about sacrifices, because kosher wild animals, such as deer, are never brought as sacrifices. The only situation where this rule can be applicable is when animals were bought with the money of the second tithe.<br />

Rather it was talking about the meat bought with the money of the second tithe.<br />
<br />
However, there is a problem with this understanding. While it is true that one cannot eat the food of the second tithe while being impure, the mention of the hands implies that one cannot even touch the food – and that nobody ever said. Therefore, we must re-interpret the rule as talking about sacrifices after all. What about the argument that wild animals were never brought as sacrifices? That is true, and we have to further modify our understanding as talking about people who undertook to eat regular food with all the stringencies applicable to sacrificial meat. Such a diet could include venison. Game meat can be confused with regular meat, so game meat was also treated stringently.<br />

This is because in his mind he decided only on the given level, and a conscious effort is required for the next one. Thus, the clothing of an ignorant person is considered impure for those who conduct themselves in accordance to the laws of ritual purity, but their clothing in turn is considered impure for those to eat the kohen's portion. Those who eat the kohen's portion (priests and their family) are considered impure for those who eat sacrifices.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/chullin-33-blood-of-shechitah-and.html"> Earlier we said</a> that if no blood flowed during the shechitah, the meat does not become susceptible to ritual impurity. Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that the shechitah alone prepares the meat to become impure. According to him, the reason that wetting the food makes it susceptible to impurity is because this is the final step in food preparation. But the final step in meat preparation is the shechitah itself. The shechitah then takes the place of wetting the food, and thus makes the meat susceptible to impurity.<br />

The verse “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=23">and drinks the blood of its kill</a>” indicates that blood is considered a “beverage,” which can prepare food to become impure, but which kind of blood? Let's analyze the following rule. If one slaughtered an animal and the blood spattered on a nearby gourd, then Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that the gourd can become impure, but his nephew Rabbi Chiya says that its state is in doubt.<br />
<br />
When blood is let from an animal, it drips slowly at first, until, after a few drops, it begins to spurt. The initial spurt is bright, but as the blood continues to flow, it slows and darkens in color. Only this is called the “blood of its kill,” when the animal dies. Rabbi Yehudah considers the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/chulin-30-process-or-result-of.html">complete act of slaughter as shechitah</a>, with the “blood of its kill” being part of it, whereas Rabbi Chiya only considers the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/chulin-30-process-or-result-of.html">final moment as shechitah</a>, thus at each stage it is only a doubt if a valid shechitah will result.<br />

The “love” or the “esteem for the holy things” is another. This unusual concept works in the following way: even the frankincense and the wood, which are not edible at all, can accept impurity if they are part of a sacrifice, and certainly food. This is derived from an extra word “meat” in the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7">and the meat, anybody who is pure can eat the meat</a>.”<br />
<br />
If an animal is close to death, then we are afraid that perhaps it died before the shechitah. Therefore, for such an animal we need additional signs of vitality. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that it needs to jerk its foreleg and its hind leg. Rabbi Eliezer says that it is sufficient for it to spout blood. The Sages say that it needs to jerk either a foreleg or a hind leg, or wag its tail. A small animal that merely extended its foreleg but did not retract it is not kosher, since this is just the spasm of the expiration of life.<br />

<br />
No! That's can't be, because the Torah also said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=14">Do not eat nevelah, an animal that died by itself</a>” which means that all the time that it is alive, you may slaughter and eat it. But perhaps <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a> and close to death are the same thing!? Rather, since Ezekiel said in his prayer “I never ate <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> or nevelah,” we understand that he never ate the meat of an animal that was close to death, though normally this is allowed – for otherwise, what would be his special praise?<br />
<br />
What is considered an animal close to death? One that cannot rise even when prompted to. Even if it gnaws on hard foods, this is done only out of desperation and in an attempt to escape death. If it lows with low mooing sounds, releases waste or wiggles its ear – it is alive.<br />

Rabbi Eliezer declares the meat forbidden. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the unspoken thought of an idolater is to dedicate the animal for his idol. Therefore, even if he sells the animal to the Jew but keeps a small part for the himself, the complete animal is prohibited. Actually, the first teacher agrees that the intent of the idolater takes effect, only the first teacher requires that it be spoken, and according to Rabbi Eliezer, even the thought is sufficient, and we can even assume that thought.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose disagrees and claims that the owner's thought has no effect at all. He argues thus. If in the Temple, where the kohen's intent is pervasive and makes or breaks a sacrifice, the owner's intent does not matter, then certainly in the case of regular food, the owner's intent is ineffective.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer answers that firstly, when the Torah uses the term "one who brings the sacrifice," it means both the kohen and the owner. Secondly, just as in the Temple, the owner's idolatrous intent matters, so too it matters for regular shechitah outside the Temple.<br />

<br />
Rav Anan said that even a Jew who worships idols – which is considered as an abandonment of the whole Torah – can still do shechitah. We know this because Yehoshaphat, the righteous king of Judah, <a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/18-2.htm">partook of the feast of idol worshiping Ahab, who thus enticed him to join forces in battle</a>.<br />
<br />
But perhaps Ahab slaughtered the animals, but Yehoshaphat did not eat them? - There is no enticement with mere words. Incidentally, although the Torah says “if your brother will entice you (to idol worship)” - that too is done with food and drink. But was not God upset with Satan for enticing Him against Job, without food? - God is different, since He does not eat anyway.<br />
<br />
Back to Yehoshaphat, perhaps he only drank but did not eat? – It is not fitting for a king to drink but not eat at a feast.<br />

<br />
Had he slaughtered for the sake of the spirit of the mountain, it would clearly be an idolatrous sacrifice, and would be forbidden for all benefit. That would be true regardless of the importance of the idol, be it the greatest angel Michael or the smallest worm with spiritual qualities ascribed to it. So by right, slaughtering for the sake of a mountain should be allowed – but the Sages made it forbidden because it is too close to an idolatrous sacrifice. However, they did not go so far as to prohibit it for all benefit.<br />
<br />
Rav Huna gave the following rule: if someone else's animal was lying in front of an idol, and one started to slaughter it – once he cut one pipe, or even less, makes a small cut – he made it prohibited for use. Even thought normally one cannot prohibit something that is not his, in a case like this, where he did an action, even a small action suffices.<br />

This point of view argues against <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-40-slaughter-done-for-sake-of.html">what Rav Huna said about slaughter in front of idol</a>.<br />
<br />
This opinion also argues against the concept of kosher wine. According to it, if a Jew owns the wine, it never becomes non-kosher, even if touched or processed by non-Jews. However, it does not become law, and it was not mentioned in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/search/label/Avodah%20Zarah">whole tractate of Avodah Zarah</a>.<br />
<br />
One may not slaughter into a sea or into a river, because it may seem that he is slaughtering to the spirit of the sea or the river. One may slaughter into a pool of water, because blood mixed with water would never be used in idol worship.<br />
<br />
If one slaughters a regular animal in the name of some free-will offering, then people may confuse it with an actual offering, and the shechitah is declared non-kosher.<br />

Rather, it is talking about an animal that is fatally wounded. Even if it was properly slaughtered, it is forbidden to be eaten as “terefah.” The defect may be caused by an animal or a man, in any place, it can even be congenital, and “in the field” simply describes a common scenario.<br />
<br />
There are eight general categories of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>, taught to Moses on Sinai, and they can be arranged according to the Hebrew acronym of “dan chanak nefesh(דן חנק נףש).” They are: clawed, punctured, deficient, removed, torn, fallen, severed, and fractured. For practical purposes the classification of terefah was divided into eighteen cases, starting with an animal whose esophagus was punctured, one whose trachea was severed, whose brain was punctured, and so on.<br />
<br />
The laws that follow are complex, and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that not everybody knows the necessary details of the <a href="http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/farm/cows/cow_anatomy.html">animal anatomy</a>. Artscroll illustrations&nbsp;can help.<br />

Chullin 43 – Seven Teachings of Terefah

They included the teaching of Rav Matna about the ball of the thighbone that popped out of its place in the socket, the teaching of Rachish bar Pappa about an animal that became diseased in one kidney, and so on. However, how could they change the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-42-these-are-cases-of-terefah.html">classical number of the eighteen cases</a>? They did not, rather, those who teach those seven rules combine all cases of punctured organs into one, and then add the seven.<br />
<br />
The esophagus has two layers, a red one and a white one. If one was punctured, but the other was not, the animal is not a terefah. The gizzard also has two layers, so the above rule applies. If both layers either in the esophagus or in the gizzard were perforated, but the holes are not aligned with each other – some say that in the case of the esophagus it is kosher, but in the case of gizzard it is terefah, and some say the opposite.<br />
<br />
Ulla said, if a thorn is lodged in the esophagus, we do not suspect that it healed (which would still be terefah), rather, it was never punctured. <br />

Rav says that any slight puncture in it renders the animal a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>. Why? According to Rav, there is no limit where one can cut the food-pipe, and it is only the windpipe that has limits. It follows then that the pharynx is a place of shechitah, and no puncture there is tolerated. On the contrary, Shmuel says that there is a definite limit where the food-pipe can be cut, and it is below the pharynx. Accordingly, the pharynx itself can be punctured, as long as the defect is less than its half.<br />
<br />
If the majority of the trachea of an animal was split, it is terefah. They brought such a case to examine before Rav, and Rav ruled the animal terefah, because he measured on the outside of the windpipe. However, Rabbah bar bar Chanah measured on the inside, declared the animal kosher, and bought thirteen measures of its meat. But didn't he buy it on the cheap and therefore benefited from his own ruling? – No, he didn't, because he bought it at the going market price.<br />

<br />
If an animal's windpipe was perforated like a sieve, then if the flesh was merely moved to the side, the animal is kosher unless half of the windpipe was perforated; however, if the flesh in the perforations was missing, then once the holes combine to an area of an issar coin, the animal is terefah.<br />
<br />
Further cases of terefah: if the membrane of the brain was punctured, and this means the lower membrane; or if the heart was punctured into its chamber.<br />

Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that the majority of the spinal cord must be severed, but Rabbi Yakov says that even if the spinal cord was merely punctured – the animal is a terefah. Rabbi Yehudah ruled stringently in practice, like Rabbi Yakov, but the law is like Rabbi Yehudah's own lenient view.<br />
<br />
If the liver was removed and nothing remained of it – the animal is a terefah. Elsewhere we learned that if less than an olive-volume remains, it is a terefah. Which is right? The opinion that requires an olive-volume belongs to Shimon the son of Rabbi Yehudah. He considered liver an organ important for the animal, therefore a healthy food, and ate it. Rabbi Chiya is the one who held that any remaining piece of the liver is sufficient. He considered the liver not such an important organ, not a healthy food, and threw it away.<br />
<br />
If the lung was punctured in both membranes, the animal is a terefah. The lung can be examined by blowing it or by submerging it in warm water.<br />

If two lobes are found to adhere to each other, there is no point in the examination – the animal is terefah even if the lungs are airtight. Rashi says that the adhesion is the result of a hole in the lungs, from which viscous fluids leaked, causing it to close. It is nevertheless terefah, because such healing is impermanent. Tosafot say that there was no hole as yet, but that the adhesion will cause it to happen. Since a puncture will inevitably occur, the animal is terefah immediately. This is true only for two lobes that are not in proximity of each other, for otherwise this is the way they naturally grow.<br />
<br />
Rava says that an extra lobe in the lungs makes an animal a terefah. Rav Acha was sitting in front of Mereimar's house when a butcher brought a case of an extra lobe for examination. Mereimar declared it kosher. Rav Acha said to the butcher, “Go ask Mereimar again.” Mereimar said to the butcher, “Tell the one sitting in front of my house that the law is not like Rava.”<br />

We learned in the eighteen basic cases of terefah that if a lung was punctured or is deficient, the animal is terefah. Does “deficient” not include the case of Ulla? – Ulla answers, “No! Punctured means a hole that leaves all the material in place, and deficient means some material is missing around the hole. Still, this rule is talking about external deficiencies, and not about internal ones.”<br />
<br />
What if a needle was found in the lung? Some say that it probably entered there through the digestive tract, must have perforated the lung at some point, and is therefore a terefah, since such punctures never properly heal. However, others say that, although less likely, it entered through the trachea, never perforated the lung, and the animal is therefore kosher. They also assume that the minor deterioration in the vicinity of the needle is not significant.<br />

Rav Ashi said to him, “Why is this worse than a needle in an ordinary piece of meat? Rather, I look at the position of the needle. If its head it sticking out of the liver, then clearly it has come into the liver by way of puncturing from the outside, and thus has made an animal a terefah, because it punctured the digestive track. But if the head is inside, then it must have taken the vascular route and is beginning to exit out of the liver, thus the animal is kosher.”<br />
<br />
Abomasum is the fourth and final division in the stomach of a cow. If it was punctured, the animal is terefah. Incidentally, the kohanim, who receive this abomasum with its rennet as one of the gifts due them, have adopted the practice of allowing this fat for consumption, following Rabbi Ishmael, who is also a kohen. He also explains the order of blessings to their benefit, as: they bless the people, and God blesses them.<br />

Chullin 5 – An Idol-Worshiping Jew Cannot Do Shechitah

Here is a challenge to it. <br />
<br />
The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-2.htm">When a man among you brings an offering to God: from the animals</a>...” The words “among you” tell us that some people are excluded from bringing voluntary offerings to God, namely, completely non-observant Jews. Further, “among you” means that only to Jews can the term “non-observant” apply, but all non-Jews can bring offerings. The words “from the animals” are extra and teach another law: people who are similar to animals in that they do not recognize their Creator are included and are still allowed to bring sacrifices, in the hope that they will improve their behavior. <br />
<br />
Then who is considered non-observant? Those who deny the complete Torah, that is, those who pour libations to idols and those who violate Shabbat in public. With this, Rav Anan's proof is refuted, and only people who observe Shabbat but violate some commandments, such as eating non-kosher meat, are allowed to do shechitah.<br />

Chullin 50 – Intestines, Rectum

However, it is also possible that the puncture happened after the animal was slaughtered. In that case it would be kosher. To find out when did the puncture really happen, one can compare a puncture in the intestines to the new one, made just for the purpose. If they look similar, the first puncture was made by people handling the meat after the slaughter, and the animal is kosher. If they differ, the animal is terefah.<br />
<br />
They brought such a case before Rava, who made an additional puncture, and seeing that it looked different, wanted to declare the animal a terefah. His son Rav Mesharshiya said to him, “Think of all the hands that the first puncture went through before it came to you.” Rav Mesharshiya then rubbed the new puncture, and it appeared the same as the old ones. Thi showed that the animal was kosher. Rava said, “My son is as wise as Rabbi Yochanan.”<br />
<br />
If the rectum was punctured, this does not make the animal terefah, because the hips support it. Even if only a finger-width of the rectum remained intact, it is kosher.<br />

Chullin 51 – Blind Pouch, Reticulum

What is an inner paunch? The smallest definition says it is the blind pouch, or the cecum, “hated by wolves” in Hebrew, since even wolves don't eat it. The largest definition says that it is the entire bottom of the paunch, which faces the ground when the animal is standing.<br />
<br />
Reticulim is the second compartment of the stomach. If it is punctured from the outside, the animal is a terefah. If a needle was found it in, and it goes through both walls, the animal is a terefah, provided that the puncture occurred while the animal was still alive. A drop of blood can testify to that. However, if a scab formed over the opening of the puncture would, then it is clear that the puncture occurred more than three days before. Thus the animal was terefah when one bought it, and he can ask for his money back.<br />
<br />
If an animal fell from a roof, it is considered terefah without any further signs, unless it survives for the next twenty-four hours.<br />

Rav Kahana and Rav Assi had two questions for Rav, which they wisely combined into one: “If a rib on one side of a vertebra and on another side was uprooted, what is the law?” They also wanted to know about one rib, but figured that if Rav gets angry when answering their question, then even one rib makes it a terefah. Rav answered, “That animal is split in half! It is nevelah!” This was a form of getting angry, and they had their two answers.<br />
<br />
If the skull of an animal was crushed in its greater part, the animal is terefah. If it was clawed by a wolf or a larger animal, it is a terefah due to the deposits of decayed meat under the predator's claws, which leads to bacterial infection. Some say that even a cat's clawing can be dangerous – but only if the cat is angry because of the prey's escape. Once a cat was chasing a chicken, and the door was slammed in its face, and the cat left five red spots on the door.<br />

Chullin 53 – The One That is Clawed

Clawing makes an animal terefah only if done with the foreleg, not hind leg and not a tooth, and not if the paw was severed before the predator drew it back.<br />
<br />
If a lion entered among the oxen, and subsequently a detached lion's claw was found embedded in the back of one of the oxen, we have two ways to reason. On the one hand, majority of lions do claw, and minority does not. That majority that claws usually does not leave a nail detached. Hence we might conclude that the ox rubbed himself against a wall and had the claw embed itself into its back. Or we can say that although most oxen rub themselves against the wall, but a claw does not usually become embedded in them, so perhaps this one was clawed. Rav, who rules leniently in cases of doubtful clawing, will declare the animal kosher, but Shmuel will say that it is terefah.<br />
<br />
An animal that was possibly clawed needs to be examined for the typical signs, the reddening of the meat.<br />

The animal is not <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> unless the thorn went all the way to the body cavity.<br />
<br />
People in the family of Yosef the Hunter used to strike an animal on the sciatic nerve and cause it die in this manner. Nevertheless, this defect does not cause it to be a terefah, because with proper medicine it would heal.<br />
<br />
Now the discussion turns to non-fatal injuries, those that do not cause the animal to become terefah, such as the case when the trachea was split lengthwise, and not cut across, or when a piece of it less than the size of an Italian issar coin was missing. Rabbi Yochanan said that the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-42-these-are-cases-of-terefah.html">list of fatal injuries</a> is specific, and things that are not on that list are kosher. Resh Lakish disagreed and said that the list of non-fatal injuries is specific and the rest are  terefah. Which case do they argue about? – The one described by Rav Matna, where the ball of the thighbone popped out of its place in the socket.<br />

If the kidneys were removed the animal remains kosher. However, Rachish bar Pappa said that if the animal was diseased in even one kidney, it is a terefah.<br />
<br />
The animal remains kosher if the lower jaw was removed. However, this is only true if it can be kept alive by human intervention of stuffing and pushing food into its throat. An animal whose uterus was removed remains kosher. One whose lung shriveled because of some fright of natural events, such as thunder and lightning, remains kosher, but not if it was scared of human. A flayed animal – Rabbi Meir declared it kosher, and the Sages sais that it is terefah, and later Rabbi Meir agreed to the opinion of the Sages.<br />

Because of this we might have thought that injuries similar to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-54-non-fatal-injuries.html">those of animals</a> would be fatal in birds. Therefore, we need the rules for birds that are kosher despite being injured, and here they are.<br />
<br />
If the trachea was split lengthwise, and not cut across; if a weasel struck (bit) it on its head in a place that does not make it terefah; if its crop was punctured, and Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that even if it was removed; if its intestines came out but were not punctured; if its wings were broken, if its legs were broken, or if its feathers were plucked – in all of these cases the bird remains kosher. Rabbi Yehudah says that if its down (small, downy feathers without long shafts that cover the bird's skin) were removed, it is terefah.<br />

Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said, “That's no proof! It occurred in the summertime, but once the cold season came upon him, he died” – because in Rabbi Shimon's view a terefah cannot survive for more than a year. The final law is that once an animal survived for twelve months, it is not a terefah. Also, if it is a female and gave birth, it is not a terefah.<br />
<br />
No worm can survive for more than twelve months. Therefore, dates stored in a container for that long are permitted to be eaten, since earth-produced worms disappeared, and new worms are not forbidden until they emerge from the fruit. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, gnats don't live for more than a day. Then what about a popular saying, “For seven years the female gnat kept aloof from the male gnat, because she said to him, 'You saw a fat inhabitant of Mechozah who went swimming in the water and you sucked blood without telling me!'” – They are talking in gnat-years.<br />

Chullin 59 – Which Animals Are Kosher?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFw61WKBBFe7Jh8GVuo9TzXhEcQmG4wDe5uCmHy9DPBwOFRCdaoGOxTLk5d1-AXf2l50dMhAbcCI5aTFSptMcX-DPRALzLjzctTGNV9d0X__FeL587q3A5sT8-X5zACu47lH9DBi6x5JU/s1600/Winslow+Homer+-+Fallen+Deer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFw61WKBBFe7Jh8GVuo9TzXhEcQmG4wDe5uCmHy9DPBwOFRCdaoGOxTLk5d1-AXf2l50dMhAbcCI5aTFSptMcX-DPRALzLjzctTGNV9d0X__FeL587q3A5sT8-X5zACu47lH9DBi6x5JU/s320/Winslow+Homer+-+Fallen+Deer.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If an animal inhaled smoke, was overcome by cold, or ate animal poison – all of which are dangerous to animals but not to humans – it is kosher. If it ate human poison or if it was bit by a snake, it is still kosher, but it is prohibited to eat it because of a potential danger to human life.<br />
<br />
Once a deer had its hind legs severed. Rav inspected it and, because the cut was below the sinews of the knee, pronounced it kosher. He wanted to taste it lightly roasted, but Shmuel said to him, “Perhaps a snake bit it before the leg was severed. Put it in the oven to check.” The meat was indeed poisoned and fell apart. Shmuel applied to Rav the words of Solomon, “No harm shall befall a righteous,” and Rav applied to Shmuel the words of Daniel, “No secret is withheld from you.”<br />
<br />
The signs of a kosher domestic and of a kosher wild animal are listed in the Torah: it should have hooves that are completely split into two, and it should be a ruminant that brings up its cud. <br />

Chullin 6 – Truly Righteous Do Not Accidentally Eat Forbidden Foods

On his way, a certain elder (some say, prophet Elijah) told him, “<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/23-2.htm">Put a knife to your jaw, if you are man of spirit</a>.” Upon hearing this, Rabbi Meir declared the wine of Cutheans prohibited, because some Cutheans were discovered to be idol worshipers, and to Rabbi Meir even a minor probability of transgression was significant.<br />
<br />
Later, Rabbi Yochanan drank their wine. Did he not hear about Rabbi Meir's decree, or did he not agree to it? Based on the rule that the righteous do not accidentally eat forbidden foods, we can deduce that he knew about it, but did not agree to it.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Zeira and Rav Assi  were served roasted eggs mixed with wine, and Rabbi Zeira did not eat them, because he suspected that tithes were not separated from the wine. However, seeing that Rav Assi ate the food, he reasoned that the righteous do not accidentally eat forbidden food, searched the stores of his knowledge and found that one should not worry about doubtful tithes when they are served in a mixture.<br />

<br />
Ravina asked a related question, “If someone planted two types of grasses together, is that a forbidden mixture?” Perhaps not, since they were not commanded to grow separately, or maybe yes, since they guessed it on their own?<br />
<br />
Rav Assi asked a question: “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=1#P12">The earth brought forth vegetation on Tuesday</a>, but <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=2#P36">the plants were not there on Friday</a>. That's a contradiction!” He answered, “All vegetation remained underground until Adam prayed for it.” Rav Nachman bar Pappa had a garden. He planted seeds there, but they did not grow.

Chullin 61 – The Signs of Kosher Birds
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJGuJrhP0JzUHGhQ2zRI8qq17iY7qzPwPhMfLM8rw4Q3JfeHRm2SB9Nt9ijWXQ4x8pmSR8Gptsh0AtshkBgMX83AlhnRizFJBzSqtWu9doSVFZhaorKv3MR8t5aAq-c4hy35TmM26BZT0/s1600/Joseph+Crawhall+-+The+Aviary.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJGuJrhP0JzUHGhQ2zRI8qq17iY7qzPwPhMfLM8rw4Q3JfeHRm2SB9Nt9ijWXQ4x8pmSR8Gptsh0AtshkBgMX83AlhnRizFJBzSqtWu9doSVFZhaorKv3MR8t5aAq-c4hy35TmM26BZT0/s320/Joseph+Crawhall+-+The+Aviary.jpg" width="219" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The signs of kosher birds were not stated in the Torah. Instead, the Torah lists twenty-four types of birds that are not kosher, with the implication that all others are kosher. The Sages, however, said, “Any bird that claws is nonkosher, but any bird that has an added toe, has a crop, and whose gizzard can be peeled, is kosher.” Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Tzadok saiys, “Any bird that part the toes of its feet when placed on a twig, so as to grab it better, is nonkosher.”<br />
<br />
Thus, there should be thousands of bird types that are kosher. However, later, and perhaps already in the times of writing down the Talmud, that is, around sixth century, the people became less knowledgeable in the names of the birds, with the result that they no longer knew with certainly which birds are nonkosher. The signs above, given by the Sages, also cannot be ascertained with ease. The result of this is that only those few birds that are known by tradition to be kosher can be eaten, while the rest cannot.<br />

Chullin 62 – Identifying Kosher Birds

The exact identification of the species' names, and the translations of the Hebrews terms are subject to many disagreements, with the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-61-signs-of-kosher-birds.html">practical result that only a few birds are known to be kosher</a>.<br />
<br />
However, we can formulate some logical rules, even if we don't know the exact physical birds they refer to. Twenty of the non-kosher birds possess all three kosher signs, that is, extra toe, crop, and gizzard that can be peeled – but they claw their prey. The raven has two of the kosher signs. The ossifrage and the osprey have one kosher sign, a different one each. An eagle has no kosher signs. To determine if a bird is kosher it is first compared to the eagle. If it is unlike an eagle and has at least one kosher sign, and it does not belong to the other twenty-three non-kosher types, then it is kosher.<br />
<br />
Ameimar formulated a rule: even if one is not expert in identifying an ossifrage and an osprey – which are rare – if he sees a bird with one kosher sign, it is kosher, provided that it does not claw. <br />

Rabbi Yochanan, when observing this bird, would exclaim, “Your judgments are in the great deep” – because the fish that is destined to perish at that time is captured by the cormorant in the depth. When observing an ant, he would say, “Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains.” This phrase from the psalms means that God provides for the tiniest ant. Alternatively, it emphasizes that an ant can carry a burden much larger than itself.<br />
<br />
The stork in Hebrew is “racham,” which connotes mercy – because it is a harbinger of rain. Rav Bibi bar Abaye said, “That is only when it sits on something makes the 'sherakrak' sound. If it sits on the ground and shrieks, it is a sign that Messiah is about to come.” But there was one stork that settled in a plowed field and shrieked, and a stone came down and cracked its skull?! – That one was a liar. <br />

But let's be concerned that they come from a non-kosher bird altogether! – We are dealing with the case where he says which kosher bird they come from, and in additional they have the kosher signs. What are these signs? They are spherical and rounded, though not a perfect sphere, with one of its ends rounded and one tapered. Then why can't we rely on these signs alone? – Because there are crow's eggs that look kosher.<br />
<br />
If an egg has a spot of blood in it, then if it is only in the place of the embryo, one can discard the blood and eat the egg, but if it is in another place, then one can assume the whole egg started developing, and it is forbidden. Some say that the place of an embryo is in the connection to the yolk, others that it is in the yolk, and still others that it is in the  egg white. The custom has thus become to discard an egg with any blood spot.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">If a bird flocks with other kosher birds, it is kosher , and if with non-kosher type, then it is non-kosher – this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. However, the Sages say that this is only true if it also resembles them. If “according to its type” is not written in the Torah with the regard to this non-kosher type, then all agree that the bird that flocks with this non-kosher type may still be kosher.<br />
<br />
To be kosher, a grasshopper must have the following signs: four walking legs, four wings, two jumping legs, and its wings must cover the its greater part. Rabbi Yose says, “Its name must be 'chagav', or grasshopper.”<br />
<br />
The school of Rabbi Ishmael derives, from the additional words in the Torah, that grasshoppers with a bold head, with an elongated head, and with a tail are also kosher.<br />

If it does not have fins and scales when young, but will develop them later, like sardines, it is also kosher. If it has them when in the water but sheds them when caught, like tuna, it is kosher.<br />
<br />
Any fish that has a scale certainly has a fin. If so, why did the Torah list both? – To make it abundantly clear for those who don't know the Torah that well. Furthermore, the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3004">Those that have fins and scales in the seas and rivers you may eat, and those that don't have the fins and scales in the seas and rivers you may not eat</a>.” Why is this repetition? – To make one who eats fish without fins and scales transgress both a positive and a negative commandment.<br />
<br />
Since the Torah only mentioned the requirement of fins and scales for seas and rivers, those worm-like creatures that originate in a vessels are permitted – as long as they have not left the vessel. A practical application is that one may drink water and not worry about worms in it, since they are kosher anyway.<br />

This permit equally applies to other beverages. <br />
<br />
Ran Huna said the rule: one should not pour beer through a sifter of wood chips at night, because a worm may part from the beer and crawl upon a chip momentarily. When it does, it becomes a creature that creeps upon the ground, and one would transgress a prohibition if he eats it while drinking the beer. But if so, let us suspect that the worm departed from the beer and adhered to the wall of the vessel and then fell back!? – That would not be a problem. The interior wall of the vessel is considered the worm's natural habitat, and the worm is not considered parted from the vessel.<br />
<br />
Similarly, worms that germinate in detached fruit are permitted, until they emerge and crawl on the ground. Rav Yosef inquired, if a worm germinated in a detached fruit and died upon contact with the ground, or only part of the worm emerged, or if one swallowed it in mid-air? – Unresolved.<br />

Of course, it has to be killed before being eaten, but that killing can be done in any possible way. In fact, if two such animals grow up and have an offspring, this offspring does not require shechitah either.<br />
<br />
If an animal was in difficult labor and the fetus put forth its foreleg and then drew it back, the fetus can be eaten without shechitah, as above, except for the foreleg. However, if it put forth its head and then drew it back, it is considered to have been born, and it will require its own shechitah.<br />
<br />
The foreleg that was put forth is prohibited because <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=22#P2142">of the phrase</a> “and meat in the field, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>, you will not eat.” The words “in the field” are extra, since a predator can attack anywhere, and it teaches an additional lesson: once meat has gone outside of its bounds (its mother's womb), it becomes forbidden. The Talmud started this topic because of its connection to the laws of terefah discussed earlier.<br />

Chullin 69 – Can a Limb be Born?

However, Rabbi Yochanan disagrees. What is the root of their disagreement? Rav says that once the limb is out of its mother's womb, it is considered to have been born. If the complete fetus is subsequently born, then its shechitah will permit the limb to be eaten. But if its mother is slaughtered, then the fetus is permitted, but the limb is forever forbidden.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, when an animal was in difficult labor, they would cut off a piece of the fetus, to ease the pain of the animal. Since there is a necessity for this measure, it is not prohibited as cruelty to animals. If he leaves the limb inside the womb and later slaughters the mother, this limb (and the whole fetus) is permitted to be eaten. The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P2998">Any that has a split hoof and chews its cud – among the animals</a>...” &nbsp;“Among the animals” (ba behemah) can be understood as “within an animal” – and this serves as the source for the law about a fetus.<br />

This rule itself is based on the same rule about their animals.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was on his way to redeem captives – which is one of the most important commandments – when he encountered the river Ginai. He said to the river, “Ginai, split your waters, so that I may cross through you.” The river answered, “You are trying to do the will of your Maker, but you may or may not succeed, while I will certainly accomplish the will of my Maker and continue to flow.” Rabbi Pinchas said, “If you do not split, I decree that water shall never flow again through you,” at which the river split. <br />
<br />
There was a man with Rabbi Pinchas, bringing flour for matzah. “Split also for him!” - commanded Rabbi Pinchas, and the river obeyed. There also was an Arab merchant with them, and Rabbi Pinchas made the river split for him yet again.<br />
<br />
When Rabbi Pinchas arrived at an inn, they poured barley for his donkey, but it refused to eat. They sifted and then cleaned the barley, but it still did not eat. “Perhaps you bought it from a source that cannot be trusted to separate the tithes,” - suggested Rabbi Pinchas - “The poor creature is going to perform the will of its Maker, so it should not be given forbidden foods.” Then the donkey ate.<br />
<br />
But, when one buys grain for an animal, he needs not tithe it? - True, if he buys it initially for the animal. In this case, however, they bought it for the needs of Rabbi Pinchas, who was known to never accept presents, and thus the exemption from tithing did not apply.<br />

Chullin 70 – Difficult Labor for a Firstborn
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4uGkcuqOyKhSB6uC4gGH2cHmh66LYuvvMKcKXoRpifU5DjROcKwy7_2nbVJQfQT3DFU36DNFKaVtV6Z_S9i46d2Nvk3XZO-nvLpBPy-YxO3vmpxfye5YB1cC5ND6bbvhQYgNKVTootSA/s1600/Eug%25C3%25A8ne+Verboeckhoven+-+A+Sheep+And+Two+Lambs+Resting+In+A+Summer+Landscape.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="256" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4uGkcuqOyKhSB6uC4gGH2cHmh66LYuvvMKcKXoRpifU5DjROcKwy7_2nbVJQfQT3DFU36DNFKaVtV6Z_S9i46d2Nvk3XZO-nvLpBPy-YxO3vmpxfye5YB1cC5ND6bbvhQYgNKVTootSA/s320/Eug%25C3%25A8ne+Verboeckhoven+-+A+Sheep+And+Two+Lambs+Resting+In+A+Summer+Landscape.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Any male firstborn lamb, kid or calf is automatically sanctified as a firstborn at birth. If the labor is normal, the firstborn is given to the priests, who later on brings it as a sacrifice. The animal is not worked, and even if it becomes blemished, its meat is not sold in the market. If an animal delivering its first young child is in difficult labor and one has to cut off pieces to save the mother, one may cut each limb as it emerges and throw it to the dogs. If the majority of the fetus emerged and it then died, it must be buried, and its mother is now exempt from the law of firstborn.<br />
<br />
If an animal's fetus died inside the womb and the shepherd extended his hand into the womb and touched it, the shepherd does not become impure with corpse-impurity. This is derived through logic: if its mother permits the fetus to be eaten, by her slaughter, then certainly it can purify from corpse-impurity. The law for non-kosher animals that are not slaughtered for food should be the same. Rabbi Yose HaGlili disagrees in the case of a non-kosher animal.<br />

Chullin 71 – Swallowed Impurity
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiP3_iENJoDecLHqbnza9hpjLzoew6N_kUxufhg2pV40X9cfQCuDZl_KGTDO3cdQ-jpelF0e9g8bQ2Hp_L3gJ5jAY14G-23GdpjMkV9R85TEJRRUOW2bcZ99-_KzVj4Nv8RRf3syFHv43I/s1600/G.+Horning+Jensen+-+Turning+the+clay+in+the+pottery.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiP3_iENJoDecLHqbnza9hpjLzoew6N_kUxufhg2pV40X9cfQCuDZl_KGTDO3cdQ-jpelF0e9g8bQ2Hp_L3gJ5jAY14G-23GdpjMkV9R85TEJRRUOW2bcZ99-_KzVj4Nv8RRf3syFHv43I/s320/G.+Horning+Jensen+-+Turning+the+clay+in+the+pottery.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If a woman's fetus died inside her womb, and the midwife extended her hand into the womb and touched it, the midwife is impure for seven days with corpse-impurity, but the woman is pure until the fetus emerges from her womb.<br />
<br />
The operative principle here is that of “swallowed-up,” or absorbed impurity, which does not transmit impurity to anything else. It is derived from the following phrase in the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3035">And one who eats of the dead animal carcass shall immerse himself</a>...” and become pure after sunset. This instruction includes even the case when he swallowed the meat just prior to sunset, and then immersed himself, so that the impure meat has not yet been digested – and he is nevertheless pure, which proves our principle.<br />
<br />
Rabbah said that the same is true for a swallowed-up pure object: it does not become impure. What's the proof? Compare the human to a clay vessel, which protects from the impurity from outside. The power of  a human is even stronger, since it protects from the swallowed-up impurity.<br />
<br />
What about swallowing an impurity via the rectum? Its protection must be even stronger, since the rectum leads to digestion.<br />

Chullin 72 – Kosher Slaughter Makes the Meat Ritually Pure

The severed limb itself is impure: if the fetus was alive, the limb was severed from a live animal and has the impurity of a dead animal (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>); and if the fetus was dead, the limb is actual nevelah.<br />
<br />
If one first slaughtered its mother and then severed the foreleg, then the flesh of the fetus is impure because it touched the limb – so says Rabbi Meir. However, the Sages say that flesh is impure with a special light impurity decreed by the Sages, which would only make a difference in the case of sacrifices.<br />
<br />
All agree that kosher slaughter makes the meat ritually pure. Why? Logically, one could even argue that should be impure, like non-kosher animals. However, since a kosher animal was fit for food when it was young, its slaughter purifies the meat even if it later became a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> (sick), whereas non-kosher ones were never fit.<br />

If the limb can heal, then it is treated as part of the animal and is rendered permissible by the animal's kosher slaughter. However, if it cannot heal, then we have the following disagreement.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish says that the dangling limb is similar to a limb of a fetus protruding from its mother's womb, and it is subject to the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/09/chullin-72-kosher-slaughter-makes-meat.html">disagreement between Rabbi Meir and the Sages</a>. Rabbi Yochanan says that in the case of a dangling limb there is no disagreement, but rather it is considered attached to the body of the animal, and shechitah makes it permitted for consumption and free from impurity – except that the Sages later forbade to eat it.  By contrast, if the animal with a dangling limb dies by itself, the limb is considered to have been detached before death, and its impurity is less than of a nevelah. How so? A piece of meat separated from a torn limb is pure, while a piece of meat separated from an animal that died by itself is impure.<br />

This rule is the subject of the last few pages, but the Talmud first discusses the exceptions to it, and now quotes the rule itself. It is also restated to introduce the dissenting opinion of Rabbi Meir.<br />
<br />
If the nine-month fetus was alive, then it is an independent animal and requires shechitah; additionally, it cannot be killed today, on the same day as its mother – these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages disagree. For animals other than cows the law is the same, only the gestation term is adjusted accordingly. <br />
<br />
A firstborn donkey cannot be used by its owner, until he redeems it with a lamb or a young goat, which he gives to a priest. Can the calf of a slaughtered cow be used for this redemption? Is it considered an independent animal, and then it could be used for redemption, or since it does not need a shechitah, is it considered like meat in a pot, and then it can't be used for redemption?<br />

If its mother became ritually impure, is the calf considered part of her, with the same impurity as her, or is it an independent being simply touching her, which results in less impurity? Further, that fat which normally goes on the Altar and is thus prohibited for consumption in the case of other animals, is it considered permitted  meat in the case of the calf, since all of it is permitted?<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon Shezuri made a statement: the calf of a slaughtered cow, even when it is five years old and is plowing in the field, is still permitted through the shechitah of its mother and may be killed in any way and eaten. But we've been saying this all along!? – Actually, the Sages have prohibited this as soon its feet touch the ground, and have put the requirement of  a regular shechitah back, because otherwise people watching it may decide that shechitah is never required. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says that the Sages made no such decree.<br />

A “junction of sinews” are the three sinews that attach the middle leg muscles to the bone of the lower leg. If they are removed, the animal becomes a terefah.<br />
<br />
If a bone was fractured and the broken ends pierced the skin, the animal remains kosher, but the limb itself is in question.

When one planned to eat it, this thought elevates it to the status of food, and now it can carry ritual impurity. <br />
<br />
If an amniotic sac partially emerged from the womb before the the animal was slaughtered, the complete sac is prohibited for consumption even after the animal was slaughtered. There is a suspicion that the partially emerged part contained the head of the fetus, which would make it legally born, and then the shechitah of the mother would not make the sac permissible.<br />
<br />
If an animal carrying its first miscarried an amniotic sac, it may or may not have been a male firstborn, and even if it was a male, it may have been deformed, therefore it can thrown to the dogs. However, if the mother was a sacrifice, the sac needs to be buried -- because both male and female young would be sanctified.<br />

<br />
For example, if one slaughtered an animal and its offspring, both regular animals, outside the Temple, and both are now fit for consumption, then for the second slaughter he is liable like for any other negative commandment of the Torah. However, if both the parent and the offspring were sacrifices and he slaughtered both outside the Temple Courtyard, then for the first slaughter he is liable because he did it outside the Temple, and may be cut off from the people, but the second animal is now unfit for slaughter on the same day, and thus the slaughterer is not liable for slaughtering it outside. He is liable for "it and its offspring" slaughter though.<br />
<br />
Two different people can slaughter the two animals, and the second one – that one who does the action now forbidden – only he is liable.<br />

<br />
The Sages compare the situation to that of a mother bird hovering over her young in the nest, where the mother bird is mentioned specifically and must be sent away. Chananyah says that you can't compare the two: sending away the mother bird does not apply to a nest that you own, whereas “it and its offspring” applies even to stray animals that are not yours. <br />
<br />
Actually, the Sages agree to Chananyah in this, however, they say that “it” means only one parent, and now by analogy with the bird it must be the mother! And Chananyah, what does he have to say now? He answers that “it" means the father, and “its offspring” implies the mother.<br />
<br />
Practically, if the father is known with certainty, then it should not be slaughtered on the same day as its offspring, even though one does not violate a definite Torah prohibition.<br />

<br />
One is allowed to slaughter with the knife of idolatry, because he damages the animal by killing it, and does not derive benefit, but he is not allowed to cut the meat with this knife, because this improves it.<br />
<br />
However, the forbidden fat collected on the knife of idolatry surely makes the meat non-kosher!? Rav agrees and says that one must peel away some meat at the place of incision, and Rabbah bar bar Channah says that one needs only wash the meat. What is the argument? Rav considers the place of the incision hot enough to absorb the forbidden fat. Alternatively, both consider it hot, but Rabbah says that the pipes are busy expelling the blood and do not absorb fat. Or perhaps both consider the place of incision cold, yet Rav says that it absorbs the forbidden fat because of the pressure exerted by the knife.<br />

Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages disagree about its laws, for example, in the case of a male deer that mated with a female goat, who then gave birth. The Sages hold that when the Torah mentions a goat, part-goat is also included, and Rabbi Eliezer maintains that it's not. Accordingly, the Sages say that the prohibition to slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day applies to a koy, while Rabbi Eliezer says that it does not. <br />
<br />
When one slaughters a wild animal, one has to cover its blood with earth. A koy, being partly a wild animal, may require covering its blood – if we attach any importance to the father – or it may not. Accordingly, the Sages do not allow to slaughter a koy on a holiday, because we may dig the earth only for clear cases of blood covering, and not for doubtful ones.<br />
<br />
Some say that crossbreeding between a deer and a goat is impossible, and that the “koy” is perhaps a wild ram, or a separate species, not clearly wild or domestic.<br />

Therefore, if one made a shechitah but found that the animal was a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> anyway, or if he slaughtered an idolatrous sacrifice, or a bull sentenced to be stoned for goring, a red heifer, or a calf designated to be decapitated to atone for a unresolved murder case, and then slaughtered its offspring, then according to Rabbi Shimon he is not liable for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day.<br />
<br />
In fact, according to Rabbi Shimon, the prohibition of “it and its offspring” does not apply to sacrifices at all. Rav Hamnuna said, this is because after slaughter the meat is not ready to be eaten until its blood is thrown on the Altar, and thus it is not a shechitah. Rava said that this is because perhaps they will not throw the blood on the Altar. Then the warning they can give him becomes doubtful at best, and one is not liable for transgressing a law without a clear unequivocal warning immediately prior to the act.<br />

If one slaughtered a cow, its daughter and its daughter's daughter on one day, he transgressed twice, but if he first slaughtered a cow and its daughter's daughter's (for which he is not liable), and then slaughtered the daughter that day, he transgressed only once. However, Sumchos says that he transgressed twice here too: when he slaughtered the middle generation, he was doing two transgressions with one act, and it is Sumchos' opinion, for example, that for eating two portions of non-kosher food was is liable twice.<br />

Therefore, on the eve of these days a seller who sells an animal, if he already sold its parent or offspring today, is required to inform the buyer and say “I already sold its mother today.” The buyer then will not come to violate the prohibition to slaughter the animal and its offspring on one day. These four occasions are: last day of Succot (Simchat Torah), Passover, Shavuot, Rosh HaShanah, and in Galilee also Yom Kippur,  because there they prepared for Yom Kippur with lavish feasts.<br />
<br />
What is considered “one day” regarding the prohibition of “it and its offspring?” As Ben Zoma interpreted, “one day” is mentioned describing the creation of the world, and there it means “there was evening and there was morning, one day,” and “one day” is mentioned for the “cow and its offspring.” In both cases the day starts in the evening at sunset and continues on the next day till sunset.<br />

Why did the Torah mentioned “trapping,” since fowl don't need to be trapped? To teach that one should eat meat only occasionally, as if he had to trap it each and every time. Additionally, <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=12#P5255">one should only eat meat if he has a great desire for it</a>, has flocks, or is otherwise rich.

Rabbah was stupefied and said, “Even circumcision is allowed on Shabbat only for clear-cut cases, and not for doubtful ones, surely covering the blood should not be allowed!” But he was refuted from the laws of shofar blowing.<br />
<br />
If one slaughters a wild animal or a bird, but it is found to be <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>, then Rabbi Meir requires him to cover the blood, but the Sages exempt him. Why do the Sages exempt him? Because it is unfit slaughter, and it is not called slaughter at all. <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/09/chullin-81-unfit-slaughter-is-no.html">But this is Rabbi Shimon</a>! Then why is he called “Sages” here, but back then in discussing the laws of “it and its offspring” he is called Rabbi Shimon, and there Rabbi Meir is called the Sages? That is because Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, the compiler of the Mishnah, agreed with Rabbi Shimon here, but agreed with his opponent, Rabbi Meir, over there. By ascribing an opinion to “the Sages” Rabbi Yehudah was indicating what he thought the law should be.<br />

Why not kill it outright? – That would also work, but even making it a terefah would allow him not to cover its blood. <br />
<br />
But could it really happen? When Rabbi Chiya and his sons came to Israel, there ceased to be earthquakes and violent winds, the wine did not sour and the flax was not afflicted, since their merit protected everybody!? – Yes, it protected everybody but not them.<br />
<br />
If a deaf-mute, a deranged person, or a minor slaughtered a wild beast or a bird, with others observing them, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/06/chulin-2-shechitah-or-ritual-slaughter.html">this is kosher</a>, but the observer is the one obligated to cover the blood. If nobody saw them, their shechitah is surely bungled, and one need not cover the blood. The same applies for “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/09/chullin-78-it-and-its-offspring.html">it and its offspring</a>,” - these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages disagree. Actually, the Sages disagree about covering the blood also, but they waited for Rabbi Meir to finish his words.<br />

Chullin 87 – Covering the Blood of Multiple Animals

Rabbi Yehudah requires separate covering for an animal and a bird since the Torah said, "animal or bird."<br />
<br />
If one slaughtered an animal and did not cover its blood, and another person saw this, he is obligated to do blood covering. If one covered the blood, and it became uncovered, he does not have to cover it again. If the wind covered the blood with earth, one does not have to cover it, but if it became uncovered, one has to do blood covering.<br />
<br />
Once a man slaughtered an animal, but another person covered the blood first. Rabban Gamliel obligated the mitzvah thief to pay the slaughterer ten golden dinars (about $12,000). Was the penalty for the mitzvah or for the blessing connected to the mitzvah? Consider the following story. <br />
<br />
A Sadducee told Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, "The one who created the wind did not fashion the mountains,"  quoting Amos. Rabbi Yehudah said, "But the verse continues – it is God of Legions!" The Sadducee asked for three days to find an answer, during which time Rabbi Yehudah fasted and prayed to win the debate. When he was breaking the fast, a Roman arrived saying that the Sadducee did not find an answer and threw himself from a rooftop. Rabbi Yehudah invited the messenger to his meal, and at the end, asked him, "Do you want to hear the blessings after the meal or to take forty golden dinars (about $50,000)?" The Roman chose the blessings, and the Heavenly voice pronounced, "The four blessings after a meal are worth forty golden dinars." His family rose to prominence as a result, and we see that the penalty was for the blessing.<br />

If blood mixed with red wine, then we look at wine as if it were water. If the corresponding amount of water in the mixture would not make it loose its appearance of blood, one still has to cover it. The same is true if it mixed with some other blood that does not require covering, such as blood of a domestic animal, but Rabbi Yehudah argues and says that blood cannot nullify other blood, and one always has to cover the mixture.<br />
<br />
Blood that splattered – the Sages say that it too has to be covered, but Rabbi Yehudah says that covering any part of it is enough. All derive their opinion from the words in the Torah “its blood” but interpret them differently.<br />
<br />
One may cover blood with fine sand or dung, lime or ground pottery, but not with course sand or dung, nor with uncrushed bricks. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel stated a rule: “Blood can be covered with anything in which plans can grow.”<br />

Chullin 89 – Sciatic Nerve

<br />
The sciatic sinew, “gid hanasheh,” is prohibited by the Torah on the account of the angel fighting with Jacob and striking him on the hip, dislocating his  thighbone. The Torah says, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=32#P961">Therefore, the Children of Israel are not to eat the displaced sinew that is in the spoon of the thigh, to this day</a>.” The “spoon” is the rounded, spoon-like flesh around the top of the thighbone.<br />
<br />
The exact prohibition mentioned the sciatic sinew, and the commonly known sciatic nerve constitutes  part of it. The prohibition applies both in the Land of Israel and outside, when the Temple is standing and now, to both regular animals and sacrifices. It applies to domestics and wild animals but not to fowl, because they do not have spoon-shaped flesh on their thigh.<br />

Chullin 9 – Need to Validate Slaughter After It Is Done

<br />
If while slaughtering one paused, this invalidates the slaughter. How long is the pause? Enough to inspect the pipes, that is, the trachea and esophagus, to make sure that the majority of both pipes were cut and that the knife did not leave the area designated for slaughtering.<br />
<br />
After slaughtering, he must indeed inspect the pipes as explained above, and if he did not inspect them, the meat is forbidden to eat. Rabbi Eliezer ben Antignos said that it is forbidden as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> (sick or incorrectly slaughtered animal), but others say that it is forbidden as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a> (meat that was not slaughtered at all).<br />
<br />
What is the argument? Both agree to the principle of Rav Huna, “An animal during its lifetime is in a prohibited state, until it becomes known that it was slaughtered properly. Once it has been slaughtered, it is in a permitted state, unless we know that it became a terefah,” but they argue about how far to take its prohibited state.<br />

<br />
Rav Pappa said that they don't really argue. Rabbi Chiya is talking about the the sinew not removed from the thigh, and then there is no prohibition to burn it, whereas Rabbi Yochanan is discussing a case where the sinew was already removed, and then it is prohibited to burn it.<br />
<br />
Rav Nachman bar Yitzhak said that they do disagree. According to Rabbi Yochanan, the complete thigh is brought to the Altar – because it would be unseemly to bring it cut – but then the sinew is removed and thrown onto the mound at the center of the Altar, which also contained ashes.<br />
<br />
At times, the mound had 300 kor (4,000 cubic feet) of ashes on it. Rava said, “That is an exaggeration.” Other examples of exaggerations, according to Rava, are that they gave a lamb to drink from a golden cup, or that 300 kohanim were needed to purify the Temple curtain in a mikva. The Torah itself uses hyperbole when it said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=1#P4918">large cities fortified to the heavens</a>.”<br />

Is this the logic of the Torah or of the Sages? In other words, is Rabbi Yehudah certain that the Torah prohibited only the right sinew, or is he uncertain which one is prohibited, and so both are prohibited out of doubt?<br />
<br />
Consider the following rule: if one ate a portion of the right sinew and of the left one, then according to the Sages he incurs double punishment, eighty lashes, but Rabbi Yehudah gives him only one punishment. Now if Rabbi Yehudah is in doubt about which sinew it is, then the person eating it can only be given a doubtful warning, which is no warning at all! Must be then that Rabbi Yehudah is certain that only the right sinew is prohibited. Why the right one? <br />
<br />
One explanation is that the angel fighting with Jacob embraced him with his right hand and extended it to Jacob's right haunch and dislocated it. Another one – Jacob thought it was a non-Jew and positioned him to his right, to better protect himself. Yet another explanation, the angel looked like a Sage, and Jacob position himself to the left of the Sage, to show respect.<br />

That is why Jacob then asked for a blessing.<br />
<br />
We see from here that some angels sing a song to God only once in a lifetime. Even those that do it daily can only sing their song after the prayers are said on earth. Moreover, angels mention the name of God only after three words, “Holy, holy, holy (is) God of Multitudes,” whereas people say “Listen, Israel, God... Is One,” mentioning the name of God after two words.<br />
<br />
Earlier we mentioned that the prohibition of sciatic sinew does not apply to fowl because they lack the spoon-shaped flesh over the thighbone. But we see that they do!? – Yes, there is a spoon, but it is not round. Rabbi Yirmiyah inquired, “What if some bird does have a round spoon-shaped flesh?” – Inquiry unresolved.<br />

For example, the Torah prohibited “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=3#P2780">the fat that is on the flanks</a>.” &nbsp;As a rule, that includes only fat that is visible when the animal is flayed, but the fat covered by the muscle is permitted. However, as Rav Yehudah taught in the name of Shmuel, the fat that is under the loins is prohibited. How could this be, if it is covered by the loins? – As Abaye explained, when an animal is alive, its limbs separate from one another, and at times that fat is uncovered.<br />
<br />
Rav Abba said, “The blood vessels in the foreleg are prohibited.” Rav Safra said to him, “Moses! Did the Merciful One say 'You shall not eat meat?'” Rava answered him, “Moses! Did the Merciful One say 'You may eat blood?'” Rather, if you are roasting the meat, the heat extracts the blood. However, if you are cooking the meat in a pot, you need to cut the vessels open first and salt them. Otherwise the prohibited blood gets reabsorbed into the meat.<br />

A non-Jew is allowed to eat it, and there is no danger that he will resell it to a Jew, since it is clear that it was not cut and the sinew was not removed.<br />
<br />
However, a cut-up thigh should not be sent, because a Jew might buy it. But how could a Jew buy presumably non-kosher meat from an idolater? – We are dealing with a place where the majority butchers were Jewish, and when a non-kosher slaughter (terefah) occurred, they announced it. Jews then would refrain from buying from a re-seller on that day.<br />
<br />
Another reason that a cut-up thigh may not be sent is that a Jew would then be deceiving an idolater, who would think that he got a super kosher piece of meat, and deceiving any person (literally, “stealing his mind”) is prohibited. One should not accustom himself to sleekness and enticement, and even one deceiving or misleading word is not allowed. <br />

<br />
But previously we learned that one is allowed to buy meat from non-Jewish resellers!? Rav will answer that perhaps the reseller never lost sight of the meat. Nevertheless, it was Rav's own stringency.<br />
<br />
Rav was once going to the house of his son-in-law and saw a ferry coming toward him. He said, “It is an omen that there will be a festival where I stay.” When everyone came to great him, he himself kept watching the meat. Then he said to the butchers, “If not for me, you would have fed prohibited meat to my family!”<br />
<br />
After all, Rav himself did not eat that meat. Not because it was not watched – for he watched it, and not because he used ferry for divination, but because it was a wedding of a daughter of a Sage to an unlearned man, and a Torah scholar like Rav is prohibited to eat at a feast that is not by itself a mitzvah.<br />

Chullin 96 – How Much of the Sciatic Sinew?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">One who removes the sciatic sinew from the thigh meat must remove it entirely. He must dig deep into the thigh and extract it from wherever it is embedded in the meat. This is the presumed opinion of Rabbi Meir, because anonymous ruling are usually his. Rabbi Yehudah says that he needs only remove enough for the mitzvah, leveling it off the surface of the rounded flesh. Both agree that the Torah required only the removal of the external part of the sinew, but Rabbi Meir opines that the Sages extended this prohibition to within the thigh, and Rabbi Yehudah says that they did not enact any additional prohibitions.<br />
<br />
Bar Piyuli was excising a sciatic sinew from a piece of thigh meat, doing this in front of Shmuel, and he was cutting it flush at the surface. Shmuel said, “Cut deeper! Had I not seen you, you would have fed me something forbidden.” Bar Piyuli became frighntened, and the knife fell from his hand. “Do not be afraid,” – said Shmuel, – “for you did nothing wrong. The one who taught you did it according to Rabbi Yehudah, but the law follows Rabbi Meir.”

<span style="font-size: medium;">If one neglected to remove the sciatic sinew and cooked the thigh together with the sinew in it, then if the thigh is small enough, so that the sinew imparts a flavor to it, the complete thigh is forbidden to be eaten. However, how do we differentiate between the two meaty tastes? We imagine that the sinew is made of meat, and the meat is turnip, and estimate whether this amount of meat will impart taste to the turnip.
<br /> <br />
If a sciatic sinew was cooked with other, permitted sinews, and afterward one recognized the sciatic sinew and removed it, then the whole mixture is forbidden only if the forbidden sinew imparts its flavor to it. Later Sages estimated to be the volume of one-in-sixty. However, if one does not recognize the prohibited sinew, then the entire mixture of forbidden, because any piece might be the forbidden one. In any case the soup is prohibited if there is forbidden taste in it. The same law holds true if a slice of non-kosher meat or non-kosher fish was cooked together with kosher slices.

<span style="font-size: medium;">There was a case of a half an olive volume of prohibited fat that fell into a pot of meat. Mar bar Rav Ashi considered measuring the pot and nullifying the prohibited fat in the proportion of one-in-thirty. His father Rav Ashi told him, “You think that you can use the rule of treating the laws of the Sages leniently. Further, you think that half an olive volume is not even considered eating. However, that is wrong. Eating <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7#P2900">any amount of prohibited food is still prohibited by the Torah</a>, just that one does not get lashes for it, the taste of the prohibited food is considered as the food itself, and the correct proportion is always one-in-sixty.”
<br /><br />
Rabbi Chiya bar Abba said in the name of Bar Kappara that all prohibited substances nullify one-in-sixty, but Rav Assi said in the name of the same teachers that it is one-in-a-hundred. Both derived their opinion from the case of a <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=6#P3840">cooked foreleg of a ram offering</a>, but one included the bones in the estimate, while the other one didn't.

Chullin 99 – Why One-In-Sixty and not the Majority?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<span style="font-size: medium;">The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2144">You should follow the majority</a>.” Accordingly, any substance should be nullified in a majority, that is, if a forbidden piece became confused with two or more permitted pieces, and you cannot tell which piece is which, then the forbidden piece becomes nullified, and all three pieces are permitted. Why did we say then <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/10/chulin-97-it-wasnt-always-one-in-sixty.html">that a forbidden foreleg becomes nullified in the proportion of one-in-sixty</a>, and according to some, even one-in-hundred?
<br /><br />
The rule of the majority is only applicable to dry pieces that became intermingled. The cooking process, however, leads to mixing of all of the particles, and its law has a special stringency. Then let's derive all other cases from it and negate the law of majority!? – No, we cannot do this, because the law of a cooked foreleg is a novelty, and we don't derive general rules from novel cases.
<br /><br />
Still, the apparent discrepancy between the laws of dry and cooked foods leads some to believe that the whole law of one-in-sixty is only a Rabbinical stringency. What about the Torah phrase that seems to indicate otherwise? – It is only a hint that the Sages found for their law.

There is another way, however: a post. This post is placed next to the alley's exit, and it serves the same purpose: either it reminds the residents of alley's courtyards that the alley is different from the street, or it serves as the beginning of the fourth wall, separating the alley from the street.
<br />
<br />
Ordinarily, this post is places partially in the alley and partially in the street, so that it is visible both from the inside and outside the alley. However, what if one placed it completely outside the alley? The people inside then won't think that it is a reminder, for it looks to them as the continuation of the alley's wall. Still, does this post help, since at least it works for the people outside?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud finds a proof that it helps, then a disproof, and then concludes that it helps. How could it be – we just found a disproof!? – Since Rabbi Chiya was the one who offered a proof, and his explanations are based on the teaching of his uncle, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who wrote down all of the rules, then he is more trustworthy.

Eruvin 11 – Shape of a door

Although it does not have practical utility, it helps for many laws. For example, an alley with an entrance wider than ten amot (20 feet) cannot be adjusted with a crossbeam on top of it, but the shape of a door here helps to permit carrying on Shabbat in such an alley. It also helps if the doors of the alley are too high for the crossbeam to be noticed.
<br />
<br />
A man from the valley of Beit Chortan took this idea to the extreme. He surrounded his field with the shapes of a door on all four sides as follows: he thrust four poles at the four corners on his field and stretched a vine across. His question now was, is that a valid separation? The matter came before the Sages, and they said that this indeed was a separation for planting. Normally, one should not plant wheat next to a vineyard. However, with the shape of a door serving as separation, it was allowed. Although the roots of the plants were next two each other and mixing, the shape of a door legally separated them into two distinct domains, and planting of wheat next the vineyard was allowed.
<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish said that just as the shape of a door was effective for planting, so too it worked for Shabbat, and the man was allowed to carry in his field. However, Rabbi Yochanan said that there was no comparison, and the laws of Shabbat were stricter. In discussing this, the Talmud considers many possibilities of how exactly his door shapes were constructed.

Eruvin 12 – Crossbar and – or a post?

This, however, is the opinion of Beit Hillel. By contrast, Beit Shammai require more: both a crossbeam and a side-post.
<br />
<br />
What is the reason for their disagreement, and what can we deduce from here about their basic points of view? Shall we say that Beit Shammai consider an area private only if it is surrounded by four walls, and that is why for  a three-walled alley they require an additional quasi-wall made of a crossbeam and a side post? – No! You cannot deduce this with certainty. It could be that in Beit Shammai's view three walls already create a private domain, so much so that one who throws an object from the street into an alley will already be liable for Shabbat violation. However, the Sages safeguarded the Shabbat by requiring further adjustment to the alley.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Beit Hillel require a beam in place of the fourth wall – is it clear to them that the third wall surely cannot be substituted by a beam, which means that three walls are a minimum to make a private domain? Again, not necessarily. It could be that Beit Hillel consider two walls sufficient, and will in fact make one liable for throwing an object into a two-walled partition. However, to permit carrying inside an alley they require a third wall and also a beam in place of the fourth.
<br />
<br />
Thus, we remain without definitive conclusions about their points of view.

Rabbi Meir initially came to study with Rabbi Akiva, but since Rabbi Akiva was a masterful logician, Rabbi Meir could never understand if his teacher was arguing a true point of view or just showing the logic of the opposite one. Therefore, Rabbi Meir went to Rabbi Ishmael, to get the facts straight, and then returned to Rabbi Akiva, and again learned the logic.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir was a scribe, and to prevent the possibility of accidental erasure in the Torah – which could lead to great confusion, such as erasing the letter dalet slightly, making appear it is a resh, which would then spell not “God is one” but “another God” – he used indelible ink. His teacher told him to always use erasable ink, since there is a portion in the Torah, intended for a suspected wife, which one should erase in water, in preparing the test to remove suspicion.
<br />
<br />
Eventually Rabbi Meir himself became the leading Sage of his generation and now the other Sages could never ascertain whether he was arguing a true point of view, or a false one, just as convincingly. Since they could never fully understand him, they never established the law based on his opinion. Nevertheless, they benefited greatly from it, as he illuminated their eyes and minds with his reasoning. The student of Rabbi Meir, Sumchos, could present forty-eight reasons why a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-56-creepy-crawly-in-alley.html">rat should be ritually impure</a> and forty-eight reasons why it should be otherwise. Ravina attempted one, by comparing to a snake, but was disproved.

What is the source for their disagreement? – The first teacher considers the crossbeam to be a reminder, thus, it has to be somewhat serious; Rabbi Yehudah says it is a symbolic fourth wall, and only has to look right.
<br />
<br />
By contrast, if one uses a side-post to delineate where the alley ends and the street begins – that side-post only has to be ten hand-breadths high, but it can be as thin as a thread. A side-post is more unusual than a crossbeam, and thus serves its purpose, whether as a symbolic wall or as a reminder.

Abaye says that it will – if they relied on it at the beginning of Sabbath – after all, they relied on it! However, Rava says that it does not help, since it was not made expressly for this purpose from the beginning. The Talmud lists a number of possible arguments pro and con, but Rava and Abaye remain unconvinced. The law, however, uncharacteristically follows Abaye – the side-post helps – and this is the "L" in the six cases abbreviated&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-15-abaye-wins.html">L</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-51-should-betrothal-allow.html">K</a>&nbsp;G&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">M</a>&nbsp;where the law follows Abaye against Rava.<br />
<br />
The side-post can be made of any material, and it can even be an animal. Here, however, Rabbi Meir disagrees – since anything that is alive cannot serve as a partition, according to him. Correspondingly, the Sages will say that an animal that is used as a coffin cover will become ritually impure, and Rabbi Meir will say that it won't. Tangentially, one can write a divorce document on an animal – but Rabbi Yose does not allow this. What are their reasons? Rabbi Yose says that the divorce document, or Get, is called in the Torah “The book (sefer) of separation.” Just as a book is not alive and does not eat – so must be the material for the divorce document. And the Sages? They understand the word “sefer” as “story,” which can be written on anything.

Eruvin 16 – Shabbat in a caravan in the desert

Since this area lacks partitions, the Sages gave it the status of “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/10/shabbat-7-special-area-called-karmelit.html">karmelit</a>”, which is neither private nor public, but still one cannot carry there. Therefore, they may decide to make a fence&nbsp;around&nbsp;the caravan. Then the following rules apply.
<br />
<br />
If they surrounded their encampment with saddles, saddlebags, and the like, then they can carry there – provided that the height of the partition is at least ten hand-breadths, that the gaps between the saddles are not larger than the total length of their fence. In addition, each individual gap should not be larger than ten amot (about 20 feet), since such a gap is considered a door. More than this is considered an opening, and then one cannot carry there.
<br />
<br />
What if the length of the gaps is exactly equal to the total length of the closed fence? Is such partition valid or not? The Talmud spends a page trying to find a proof. In the end, since&nbsp;the verbiage of our ruling above is most easily understood if we assume that gaps equal to fence are valid, this become the law.<br />

Eruvin 17 – Fence of ropes

If the thickness of the ropes together adds up to a hand-breadth, then they have a valid fence ten hand-breadths high. They could also surround their camp with vertical poles, ten hand-breadths high, and place them at three hand-breadths from each other.
<br />
<br />
How does this work? It relies on the principles of “Closing”, “Lavud” in Hebrew, which states that a gap of three hand-breadths can be considered closed for the purposes of Shabbat, ritual purity, and other similar laws where partitions are involved. 
<br />
<br />
However, there are those who disagree. Rabbi Yehudah limits the partition of ropes only for a caravan of three or more people. His son Rabbi Yose is even more strict: he says that any partition that does not have criss-cross elements is not a partition. The Sages, however, say that a partition can be either vertical or horizontal.
<br />
<br />
Wait a minute! The Sages are repeating themselves!? – This is another group of Sages, and they differ with the first one in permitting such partition even for an individual at home, not in a desert.

Eruvin 2 - Houses, courtyard, alley

<br />
Several houses open into a courtyard, and several courtyards open into an alley. Usually the alley has one of its ends closed, so strictly speaking all of these areas are private domains, and one should be allowed to carry from any house to any house, in the courtyard and in the alley.<br />
<br />
However, since these structures are similar to public areas, like a street, and since one can confuse the two and come to carry in the street, the Sages prohibited carrying between the houses through the courtyard and between the courtyard through the alley - unless some preparations have been made. A symbolic fourth wall has to be created, even if it just a beam across, and common food has to be stored, making all residents as if one family.<br />
<br />
A beam that is placed across the entrance into an alley must not be higher than twenty amot (about 40 feet). If it is higher, it must be placed lower. The Talmud immediately asks: we will learn that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkah">sukkah</a> must not be higher than twenty amot, and if it is higher than that, it is invalid. Why "invalid" for sukkah but "placed lower" for an alley? The answer: since the sukkah requirement is dictated by the Torah, then the Sages just tell you the law, "invalid." The beam over an alley, however, is dictated by the Sages themselves, and as they explain it, they can also tell you how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Or, if you want, I can give you another explanation. Since the laws of the sukkah are numerous (shade, sun, walls, etc.) it is easier to just say "invalid" and let you find a way to fix it. The laws of an alley are relatively simpler, and the Sages can start teaching them right away by saying "place it lower."<br />

Eruvin 3 – Partially high enough

The beam should be placed no higher than twenty amot (about 40 feet). The same measurement is true for the sukkah – its covering should not be higher than twenty amot. In both cases the reason is that people should notice and be mindful of it.
<br />
<br />
What if the beam is partially higher than twenty amot and partially lower? And the same question can be asked about a sukkah. Rabbah said, “It is OK for an alley but not OK for a sukkah.” Why? The same reasoning should apply to both! – The answer  is that sukkah is a private dwelling, so if its covering gradually thins out and all of it is too high, one who lives in it may not notice. However, an alley is used by many and they will remind each other.
<br />
<br />
In another version Rabbah said just the opposite. What is the reason in this case? One who lives in the sukkah knows that it is up to him to keep it kosher. However, with an alley everyone relies on someone else to check. As the proverb has it, “When two people cook, the dish is neither hot nor cold.”
<br />
<br />
What is the final conclusion? It is OK in both cases, since the correct understanding of “too high” is “the airspace is too high.”

Eruvin 30 – Common food (eruv)

<br />
<br />
Any kind of food can be used for the eruv, except for water and salt – since they do not properly nourish. Incidentally, one who vowed to abstain for nourishment can still drink water and eat salt. The food does not have to be edible by the owner, as long as others can eat it. For example, one can make an eruv of wine for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazirite">nazirite</a>: even though he is prohibited to drink wine, others can. Similarly, one can make eruv of terumah (Kohen's portion) for a regular Jew: even though he cannot eat it, but a Kohen can.
<br />
<br />
One can make an eruv with meat cooked rare – since some people eat it, and with raw eggs – again, since they are eaten under certain circumstances. How many eggs would be needed? Since the eruv should be sufficient for two meals, two eggs will constitute an eruv.
