For example, if he bought fruit in the market and has a doubt if the tithes were properly separated, he can still use this for an eruv – since poor people can eat it, and he can make himself poor by renouncing all his possessions. 
<br />
<br />
However, if the food is definitely not tithed, then it cannot be used for an eruv, because one is not allowed to tithe on Shabbat, and thus the food is not edible by anybody. 
<br />
<br />
A similar list of of foods is found in many places in the Talmud, for example, it applies to the laws of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/09/brachot-50-how-to-invite-to-prayer.html">communal prayer after a meal</a>: one who ate doubtfully tithed produce may be joined in this prayer, but one who ate definitely untithed produce cannot.

Eruvin 32 – One's dwelling on Shabbat

A city is considered one's dwelling, so practically one can walk half a mile away from the city, but no more than that.
<br />
<br />
If he still needs to go further, he can change his dwelling place. For that, on Friday he can walk up to two thousand amot in the direction that he will have to go on Shabbat, and place food (“eruv”) there. This place then becomes his new “dwelling,” and he has to stay in the new circle. We thus find that he can go from his home to the new place, but not in the opposite direction, because this is where his new circle ends.
<br />
<br />
If he cannot go there on Friday to establish his eruv, he can send a messenger. However, if this messenger is a deaf-mute or deranged person, his eruv won't be valid, because they do not have the necessary understanding of the matter. On the other hand, if the deranged person only transports his eruv, but a sound-minded person accepts it there, it is valid.

Eruvin 33 – Eruv on  a tree

<br />
<br />
However, if he placed his eruv on a tree, he has a problem. The Sages prohibited taking objects from a tree on Shabbat, and therefore his eruv food is not accessible to him and is invalid. Nevertheless, the ruling is different and states that if the eruv is on a tree above ten hand-breadths from the ground, the eruv is indeed invalid, but if it is lower than that, it is valid. 
<br />
<br />
How can we explain this? First, we are forced to say that this must be the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who says that at twilight the laws of the Sages do not apply. The tree is not muktzeh, and he can take his eruv. If so, why does ten hand-breadths make a difference? Well, the tree itself is similar to a house and is a private domain. When he takes his food from it and brings it to himself in the public domain, he violates Shabbat, and since he cannot do that, his eruv is invalid. However, below ten hand-breadths people usually do not carry, such area is called a “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/10/shabbat-7-special-area-called-karmelit.html">karmelit</a>”, its prohibition is lighter, and his eruv is again valid.

Why do we need to be told this, it is obvious?! If the pit is in the private area – why, the pit is also a private area, and it goes all the way down and all they way up; thus, to get his eruv he does not need to transfer from a private to a public domain, and there is no prohibition in that. Rather, it must be that the pit is in the public area. But then he would not be allowed to get the food out, and the eruv would not be valid. Rather, it must be that the pit is in an area that is neither public nor private, and such transfers are prohibited only by the decree of the Sagse – which does not apply on Friday with the twilight, when the eruv takes effect! Thus, he can get his food at this time, and the eruv is valid.
<br />
<br />
If he placed his eruv food atop a reed or a pole, even hundreds of feet high, it is valid – provided that the reed was uprooted and later stuck back into the ground. Why being uprooted makes a difference? – In trying to remove his food from the reed's top, he may accidentally break off a piece, and in doing so   he will perform the labor of reaping. This is prohibited even at twilight, when the eruv should have taken effect, and thus it never becomes valid.

But why? It is not accessible! – It is a closet made of bricks, and he can break it, and in this way get to his food. But then he is demolishing, and that is prohibited on Shabbat!? – The closet is not cemented, it is just bricks put together. 
<br />
<br />
If his eruv rolled beyond the “techum”, that is, the two thousand amot (about 2000 steps) that he is allowed to walk on Shabbat, then it is not valid. The same is true if it was burned or buried under a heap of rubble. Still, if this happened on the Shabbat day, it is not a problem, since the eruv already took effect on Friday night.
<br />
<br />
What if we don't know when the eruv food rolled out? Rabbi Meir says that since this is in doubt, then he is caught: he does not have his previous residence area (techum) and has not acquired a new one, so he has to stay put. However, multiple opinions said that a doubtful eruv is valid, and this became the law.

Eruvin 36 – Running away from a tax collector

If one fears a visit from a tax collector on Shabbat, he may increase the two thousand step limit that he is allowed to walk, to four thousand, in the following way. He can place two portions of eruv food in two places, one two thousand steps to the east and another – to the west. He can then make a stipulation, saying that if the tax collector comes tomorrow from the east, his west eruv takes effect, and if he comes from the west, then his east eruv is activated. If the collectors come from both directions, he will decide where to go, and his direction will determine the eruv, and if they don't come at all, neither of his eruvs are active, and he stays where he resides. 
<br />
<br />
This is an example of the future affecting the present (bereirah). If the tax collector comes from the east in the future, then the west eruv is effective as of now. When tomorrow he actually comes, his future coming reaches into the past and changes the legal reality of the designation.
<br />
<br />
The same law applies when a man wants to hear a Sage coming with a lecture to a nearby town, and it is not known which town this will be. He makes two eruvs and makes a similar stipulation: if the Sage comes from the east, his east eruv is the one taking effect, etc. If two Sages come, he will decide which one he will go to. Rabbi Yehudah says that if one of the Sages is his teacher, he must go to him. Why? He might want to listen to another one!? – Some say that Rabbi Yehudah does not agree to the retroactive designation. In all other cases, Rabbi Yehudah explains that the Sage has already come – except that the man does not know to where. Others say that Rabbi Yehudah agrees to the retroactive designation but does not permit one's future decision to influence past reality.

Investigating this further, the Talmud quotes the rule about a barrel of wine.
<br />
<br />
If one buys a barrel of wine in Samaria, where many residents did not separate tithes, on Friday afternoon, so that he does not have the time to tithe, he can nevertheless prepare his wine for drinking with the following declaration. He says, “The two percent that I will separate in the future are hereby designated as 'terumah,' the Kohen's portion. The ten percent are Levites' tithe, and the other ten percent are for the poor.” 
<br />
<br />
He then drinks the wine on Shabbat and leaves over the necessary amounts. Every drop that is left now was present somewhere in the barrel on Friday, so we can say that this same drop was &nbsp;designated as tithe on Friday. Thus the future event of leaving some wine over determines the past designation of this wine as tithe. This principle is called “bereirah,” or “clarification”, and it is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. However, the other Sages did not agree with Rabbi Meir, asking him “What if the barrel breaks? He will have drunk untithed wine!” Rabbi Meir answered, “When it breaks, then we will worry about it.” What he really meant is that one can appoint a guardian to protect it. And the Sages? They say that the guardian himself may fall asleep, thus he needs another guardian, and so on, without end.

Eruvin 38 – Eruv for two days

Rabbi Eliezer says that when a festival (yom tov) is followed by Shabbat, these are separate entities, and he can simply prepare two different eruvs, stating which way he wants to go based on each eruv.
<br />
<br />
However, the Sages say that two days of rest constitute one long entity, and one therefore cannot separate them. Here is the procedure that they recommend he should follow. At the beginning of the first day, which is a festival, he brings his eruv to the new place where he wants his new dwelling to be established. Then he waits until dark, acquires his new residence there, and now takes his food with him – out of fear that it may be consumed by wild animals. On the next day, he brings his eruv back, waits until night, and eats it (since on Shabbat he cannot carry it anyway). Because the food was present at the beginning of Shabbat, he has acquired his new residence there, and can walk two thousands steps in any direction from this place. He has thus acquired the possibility to walk the extra two thousand steps that he wanted, but was also able to benefit from his eruv food by eating it.

Eruvin 39 – Making conditions

Even though the Torah, of course, decreed only one day of Rosh HaShanah, practically it was very hard to know when this day occurs – on the last day of the previous month, or the first day of the next one. So as not to do work on Rosh HaShana by mistake,  people abstained from work on the first possible day of Rosh HaShana, and then also on the second. 
<br />
<br />
If one wants to wants to go beyond two thousands steps in different directions on two days of Rosh Hashanah – he can, provided that he places his eruv food in appropriate places, since after all, only one day is the real festival – this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The Sages agree that it is one festival, but they argue that its long-term observance for two days made both days into one long Rosh HaShanah, so that he cannot have two different eruvs.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah also allows to set other conditions for Rosh HaShanah. For example, if one has two baskets of fruit from which tithes have not been given, he can say on the first day of Rosh HaShanah, “If the festival is tomorrow, then I am separating tithes from one basket with the fruit from the other, but if the festival is today, I have not said anything.” Then he makes a similar condition on the second day and eats the fruit. Again, the Sages say it is all one long Rosh HaShanah. However, even the Sages allow such conditions to be made for the two days of a Yom Tov festival, since this second day is observed only outside of Israel and is thus not a universal requirement.

Eruvin 4 - The statement of Rav
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Rav said, “There are three laws that are never mentioned in the Torah, but instead God taught them to Moses on Sinai.” They thus have no written support, but were transmitted from teacher to student. 
Firstly, amounts to which Torah laws apply. Now, how could that be, when we know that all such amounts are described in the Torah in terms of fruit of the Land of Israel? For example, to become impure in a house afflicted with tsaraat (spiritual impurity of the owner resulting in spots on the walls of his house), one have to stay there for enough time needed to eat half a loaf of bread, and we mean wheat bread, not barley. So we have wheat. Next: a bone fragment, to transmit impurity, needs to be at least the size of a barley kernel. Thus we have barley, and so on. Rav will answer that the Torah did not give the exact limits anywhere, it is the Sages who gave the limits, and they based their opinions on the fruit of Israel.
<br />
<br />
Secondly, the laws of the mikveh. Here too, how could this be, when the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=15#P3179">Torah described the mikveh</a>! – True, but it did not give such details, for example, as that one hair makes a knot that prevents water, and makes the immersion invalid, while three hairs can never be tied in a strong enough knot. 
<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the laws of partitions – that a fence ten handbreadths high separates a room into two legally separate areas. But we did learn this from the construction of the Temple and the height of the cherubim! Rav answers that the Torah did not go into such particulars as the fact that objects that are less than three&nbsp;hand-breadths&nbsp;away can be considered connected by an uninterrupted partition.

Eruvin 40 – Conditional prayer

However, because it is was not exactly known when the court will establish the first of the month (which was based on seeing the moon), Rosh HaShanah was celebrated for two days since very long ago. This is still true today, whether in Israel or outside. What does one say in prayer?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Dosa says that one makes his prayer conditional: “Strengthen us on this new moon which is Rosh Hashanah, whether it is today or tomorrow.” On the next day, he adds, “Whether it is today or was yesterday.” If one does not phrase his prayer this way, it will contain a false statement. However, the Sages do not agree, saying that if you phrase your prayers conditionally, then the people will treat the holiday lightly and may do work on it.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Dosa disagrees with the Sages on many points, and the Talmud enumerates them, adding that all of them had to be told. Otherwise, we might have though that the fear of treating the day lightly applies only on Rosh HaShanah, when people might transgress by doing work; by contrast, on the new moon work is permitted, so this prayer could be conditional – we are told that the Sages disagree here also, and require one form of prayer, without conditions.

Should one complete the fast and maintain his profound grief, or should he eat a little so as not to enter Shabbat while suffering? For example, Rabbi Akiva would eat a raw egg without salt. The final conclusion is that one should complete a full fast until it is definitely night, and only then start the Shabbat meal.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-32-ones-dwelling-on-shabbat.html">We already discussed</a> that one may not leave his residence area on Shabbat and Festivals - about two thousand steps from his abode. It may be a city, a stand-alone house in a field, or just a personal space, four steps around himself if he happens to be outside in the open area. Thus, if he is alone in a Shabbat field, he may walk the four steps of personal space, plus a circle of two thousand amot (roughly, steps). This circle is called his "techum."
<br />
<br />
If gentiles removed him from his techum – he looses his residence area, and in the new place he can only walk four steps around but no more. The same holds true if he leaves his techum while being temporarily deranged. If they then returned him to his residence, he regains the complete techum, because he is not to be blamed or punished for what happened. 
<br />
<br />
Tangentially, some things cause a person to go against his will and his Maker. Idolaters may force him to do wrong (like in the above example) and the pressure of poverty. Why do we need to know? – to pre-emptively pray to be spared. However,  one who suffers from poverty and intestinal disorders in this world comes purified into the next one. Some also add here a bad wife.

Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar say that, since it is a private area, he can freely walk there. However, Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva contend that because he lost his techum, he can walk only four steps around, and that's it.<br />
<br />
It once happened that these same four people were on a ship. When Shabbat started, they were in a port, but later the ship moved out to sea, and they lost their original techum. Following their respective opinions, the first pair moved freely around the ship, but the second one only walked for four steps around. 
<br />
<br />
However, upon closer examination, even they could walk the complete ship – is' just that they chose to follow this additional stringency, in order not to mislead the people who would not know the difference between placed in a corral and on a ship. And what is indeed the difference? With the corral, one did not acquire residency there before Shabbat, but instead was brought there. However, with the ship, one acquires his residency there at the beginning of Shabbat. Others say that since the ship keeps moving, he is always walking only four steps – except these four steps keep changing as the ship moves. Why do we have to come up to this reason, which seems artificial? – Because the walls of the ship are not made to enclose him, but rather to keep the water out.<br />
<br />
What is the practical difference between the two explanations? – If the walls of the ship break, or if he jumps to another ship – he would be allowed to walk there only according to one explanation but not the other.

However, public area goes only as high as ten hand-breadths, and higher than this its limitations do not apply. Of course, if one sits on a high pole in a street, he is nevertheless considered to be in the public area, since the pole rests on the ground. However, if one flies in the air, using one of the mystical names of God, do the limitations of techum apply to him? Can he fly beyond two thousand steps? The same question would apply for a ship that is flowing more than ten hand-breadths above the sea floor.
<br />
<br />
Can we derive the answer from the story <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-42-shabbat-on-ship.html">of the ship in the sea</a>, where the limitations of techum seemed to apply? – No, because perhaps that ship was in shallow waters. Another story: once <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-43-seven-teachings-of-terefah.html">seven rulings about terefah</a> were told to Rav Chisda on Shabbat morning in the city of Sura, and on Shabbat afternoon to Rava in the city of Pumbedita. The distance between those two cities is certainly more than two thousand steps, and who could have recited the ruling but Elijah the Prophet, who travels with the help of the names of God!? It must be then that the techum does not extend above ten hand-breadths from the ground! – No, the ruling could have been brought by the well-known demon by the name of Yosef, who does not observe the Shabbat laws anyway, so we cannot learn anything from his behavior.

Now all he could walk was four steps around him, and he was not permitted to go back to his town or to his home. When Rav Chisda heard of this, he was talking to Rav Nachman, and said, “Nechemyah, your student, is in suffering.” Rav Nachman replied, “Make a human fence – that is, line up people to create a corridor, and he will be able to enter back into his techum through it.
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda did so, and Nechemyah came back. But how were they allowed to create a human fence? After all, they are creating a partition and a private area on Shabbat!? – Rav Chisda called them, but he did not tell them why he called them, so they were not consciously doing it. But how were they allowed to walk beyond the techum? – They all have made an eruv in a different place, so they were allowed to walk farther than Nechemya. But still, people might&nbsp;misunderstand&nbsp;this law and do it voluntarily next time? – That is true, and such a ruse is only allowed for a scholar like Nechemyah. 
<br />
<br />
To illustrate, later there was a story when Rava was returning from a lecture he had delivered on Shabbat, surrounded by throngs of people, and his attendant used this live partition to bring back some flasks that were left in the public square. However, when on the next Shabbat the attendant wanted to do the same, Rava forbade it, because now people were aware that they were used as a human partition.

As we will learn later, a traveler can mentally designate his residence area for Shabbat, or techum, even if he will reach it only on Shabbat. What if he sat down to rest while he still was on the road on Friday afternoon, and once he arose after dark, he saw that there was a city nearby where presumably he would like to be on Shabbat? Rabbi Meir says that intentional designation of a techum is required. Since our traveler did not do so, he cannot enter the city. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that since his presumed intention would be to enter the city, we count it as a real intention, and he may enter – and travel two thousand steps around it.
<br />
<br />
What if the traveler fell asleep on the road, while Shabbat was approaching? Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says that he nevertheless acquired a techum around himself, for the two thousand steps – but the Sages says that he can only move four steps about. What is the argument? One explanation is that a sleeping person is treated like an inanimate object, and they really argue about inanimate objects – do they also acquire a techum or no. 
<br />
<br />
If two people are stuck on Shabbat, and each has only four steps to move about him, but their techum's overlap – they can bring food and eat together, provided that one does not take food into his four steps area and away from his friend's area. This presumes that food acquires the techum of the owner, however small.

Eruvin 46 – Residence area for rain water

On Shabbat one cannot carry things in the street anyway, but on a Yom Tov (Festival) this law would apply. Someone's objects would have the same restriction as their owner. By contrast, ownerless objects have no owner. Some say that they do not acquire any techum, and thus cannot be moved beyond four steps, others – that they acquire the two  thousand steps around them.
<br />
<br />
What about rain water? We have a rule that whoever picks up rainwater collected on a Festival can carry it as far as he can go. Why is that? The rainwater should acquire residence in the ocean or in the cloud!? And if you try to answer that the water is not physically present, that it is vapor, then I will say that it's even worse – if it only appears on a Yom Tom, then it is something new that came into existence just now, and the rule is that one should not use it at all! Rather, our explanation should be that the water in the cloud is constantly moving. As such, it does not acquire any techum whatsoever, and when someone picks it up, the rainwater gets its new owner's techum. The same explanation would work even if we say that the water evaporated from an ocean just today – it was moving there also, and never acquired the techum restrictions.

Eruvin 47 – Who does the law follow?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAy_F7O_O2LBAjK3YmuRQpAT5T_DZfE1Uv3h8Fm7V96gnDFuRp8myjt50D9OCzqd24Gkeag1FJGx7y3hrZXb8gQtNpqXhgcGsuxpigOTuROp9_pVJ8314KJpf_DB0C8EEh4fbVQPM-hrcA/s1600/Giovan+Francesco+Locatelli+-+The+rich+and+poor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAy_F7O_O2LBAjK3YmuRQpAT5T_DZfE1Uv3h8Fm7V96gnDFuRp8myjt50D9OCzqd24Gkeag1FJGx7y3hrZXb8gQtNpqXhgcGsuxpigOTuROp9_pVJ8314KJpf_DB0C8EEh4fbVQPM-hrcA/s320/Giovan+Francesco+Locatelli+-+The+rich+and+poor.jpg" width="268" /></a>The majority of the laws are formulated by the four students of Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Yose, Rabbi Yehudah, Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Shimon. Whenever they disagree, the law is decided first in accordance with Rabbi Yose, if he is one of the disputants, then Rabbi Yehudah, and so on, in the order listed above.
<br />
<br />
However, Rav Mesharshya said that these rules are not true. That is strange: these rules are so well established that hardly anybody argues with them. The Talmud goes through multiple example, trying to agree with Rav Mesharshya. For example, to change one's residence area for Shabbat (techum), a poor man can walk to the new place on Friday evening and stay their until night, and a rich man can put his food there, even through a messenger. Rabbi Meir says that these laws are for the benefits of the poor, who alone is allowed to do in the first one, but Rabbi Yehudah says that they are a leniency for the rich. On that, Rav said “The law follows Rabbi Yehudah.”
<br />
<br />
But Rav did not have to say this! We know it from the rules of precedence! It must be, therefore, that Rav Mesharshya is right,  and the rules of precedence do not apply!? – No, only Rav does not agree with them, but others do.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then makes a few more attempts, but concludes that everybody agrees to the rules of precedence and Rav Mesharshya must be wrong. Then what did he mean by his statement? – Only that these are not universally accepted, and there is at least one Sages who disagrees – this Sage being Rav himself.

Eruvin 48 – Objects brought to market by non-Jews

On Shabbat, one cannot carry at all. But on a Festival, they can be taken only as far as the owner himself can go, two thousand steps from his residence. By contrast, ownerless objects acquire residence on their own, same say, just four steps around them, and others – two thousand steps.
<br />
<br />
What about objects (say, sheep) that were brought to a market by a non-Jews from a distance greater than two thousands steps? Some say that they are like ownerless objects, and a Jew may buy and use them on a Festival (of course, not by paying money, but but promising to pay later). Others say that they have the same law as Jewish objects – for without this law the Jews also may eventually forget the techum limitations.
<br />
<br />
Such case actually happened, and Rava allowed everyone to buy them, following the first opinion. When he heard that Rabbi Yochanan upholds the second view, he reconsidered and said that the sheep can only be moved four steps around their residential area. However, since their new residential area was that town where the fair happened to be, all residents who live there could actually buy and use the sheep for the Festival, but not anyone out-of-town.

Eruvin 49 – How does the eruv really work?

<br />
<br />
How does this device work? Shmuel says that everybody acquires a portion in this house where the eruv is stored. The courtyard then belongs to this one house, is a single area, and they can all carry there. We can ask Shmuel that if so, why do they need bread at all? Let them use the money! Shmuel will answer that money is not always available on Friday afternoon, but bread is. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbah says that the eruv works because where your food is – that's where you live, and in effect, everybody temporarily moves into the house with the eruv. What difference does it make, and why do we need different explanations?
<br />
<br />
The first difference is when they made the eruv with baskets, not bread. It works according to Shmuel, because they acquire a portion in the house, but not according to Rabbah because a person does not live where his basket is.
<br />
<br />
The second difference manifests itself if they all put together pieces of bread, each worth less than a small coin, prutah. Now it will not work according to Shmuel, because a value less than a small coin can not acquire anything. However, one can establish his residence even with a small piece of bread, and so this justifies Rabbah.
<br />
<br />
Finally, the third difference is when they ask a minor to collect bread from everybody. Again, it does not work according to Shmuel, because a minor cannot be an agent to acquire things, but he can perfectly well carry bread to a house and deposit it there, just as Rabbah said.

Instead of lowering the beam, he may decide to raise the floor. How much does he need to raise it?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud asks, “What’s the question? He must reduce the gap to twenty, so he must raise it as much as needed for that.” The question if then rephrased, “How wide does the floor platform have to be?”
Rav Yosef says that just one hand-breadth is enough, but Abaye requires four hand-breadths. Since people are allowed to carry under  the beam itself, they will notice even a small platform directly under the beam – that is the view of Rav Yosef. Abaye, who says that people are not allowed to carry directly under the beam – so that they don’t accidentally step out  into the street – will require four hand-breadths to be noticed.
<br />
<br />
However, it could be that they  both agree that one is allowed to carry directly under the beam. If so, they could be arguing about the reason for the beam. Rav Yosef says that it is a distinctive mark, and one hand-breadth already provides the needed reminder, while Abaye says that the beam is to form a symbolic partition, as if closing off the alley, and it needs to be at least four hand-breadths.
<br />
<br />
Or you can say that they agree on that the beam placed as a reminder. Then they could be arguing about a principle of “below should be like above. “ Rav Yosef agrees to this, and just as the beam itself is only one handbreadth, so too the platform below, while Abaye does not agree, and requires a larger platform.<br />
<br />
The law in all these cases follows Rav Yosef.

Eruvin 50 – It got dark while on the road

He would be able to walk to the tree, and then two thousand steps to his home.
<br />
<br />
However, he should express it correctly. If he just says, “Let my residence be under that tree,” - he has not said anything. He should have designated the specific four steps, such as “next to the trunk.”
<br />
<br />
What does it mean, “He has not said anything?” Rav says, literally, he got nothing: he lost his current area, did not acquire a new one, and has to stay within four steps of the place where the sundown catches him. However, Shmuel says that he acquired his residence somewhere, only it is not known where. Therefore, he can walk to the tree, if it is close enough, but he may not walk to his home – if it is exactly two thousand steps from the tree. That is because his residential four steps may be behind the trunk, away from home, and thus farther away than two thousand steps from his home.
<br />
<br />
They asked question on Rav, based on an old ruling (Mishnah) as follows: “If one asked his servants to prepare him an eruv with bread, and they did it in two places, then he can only walk in the common area of the two.” However, he can surely move for more than for steps! And they answered that Rav lived for 300 years, both in the time of the Mishna and of the Talmud, and was thus the only Talmud Sage whose opinion was part of the Mishna; thus, this contradiction did not present a problem for him.

Rabbah said to Rav Yosef, “Let our Shabbat residence be established under that tree (he knew it) that produces so much fruit that it relieves its owner of paying taxes.” Rav Yosef countered, “But I don't know it.” Rabbah then quoted in the name of Rabbi Yose, “One who does not know the place can rely on the other one who does.” That was not actually true, the rule was not in the name of Rabbi Yose, but Rabbah attributed it to him on purpose, so that Rav Yosef (who was blind) would accept its authority, since Rabbi Yose is known for deep reasoning behind his rulings.
<br />
<br />
What is the source for the two thousand steps limitations? It comes through a chain of “same word” connections, which ends up with the city of Levites, having a two thousand amot area of space and vineyards around it.
<br />
<br />
Was the techum area square or round? Rabbi Chanina ben Antignos says that it was round. What about the cities of the Levites, whose area around was square? – He notes that the Torah says “This will be or them the area around,” and explains, “This for them” but not this for others. And the other teacher? He understands it, “Like this, for them and for others.”

<br />
<br />
Why? What is the difference between him and his neighbors? They did not reach the other city to establish the residence over there – but he did not either! Rav Huna explained. We are talking about someone who has houses in both cities, so potentially he can decide to reside in this other city ofnShabbat. So, when he started on the road, without food, he has the status of a poor. Therefore, his verbal declaration of residence in sufficient - this is a leniency reserved only for the poor, and actual going there is not required. However, his neighbors who stayed at home, they do have bread at home, and are considered rich. And rich people are not allowed to designate their residence by verbal declaration alone, they need to put bread in this new place. This is why he is the only person who is allowed to go there.

What is considered border for this purpose? If the corner houses are not in a straight line, they measure the techum from those houses that are farther away from the center. Any additional ruins, bridges or tombs also extend the techum.
<br />
<br />
The word “extends” can be spelled with an aleph (מאברין), meaning “a limb,” or with an ayin (מעברין), meaning “pregnant”. Rav holds one view on this, while Shmuel – the other. The Talmud lists other differences between Rav and Shmuel: (a) was the “new king of Egypt” really new, or did he just take new measures to oppress the Jews; (b) was the grave of the patriarchs called “double” (machpelah) because it had two stories or because it had multiple couples buried there, and (c) was Nimrod the real name of the king and was he called Amraphel (which means “said and threw”)  because he commanded to throw Abraham into the fire, or was his real name Amraphel, and he was called Nimrod (rebel) because he caused people to rebel against God.

The Talmud then finds multiple examples where using precise language is very important, and ends up with the story of Rabbi Yehoshua, who asked a boy sitting at a crossroad, “Which is a good road to town?” The boy said that one road was short but long, and the other – long but short. Rabbi Yehoshua chose the short road, but near the town he was met with gardens and fences, which made it very hard to pass. He came back and asked the boy about his advice. The boy said, “Didn't I tell you, it was short but long?” Rabbi Yehoshua then chose the long but short road and eventually got there.

Why? – “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2804.htm">For they (the words of learning) are life to those who find (motzaehem) them</a>,” which can also be read as “motziehem,”pronounce them out loud.”
<br />
<br />
It also says, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2801.htm">They (the words of learning) are like a necklace on your neck</a>.” What is the lesson? Just as the necklace, one must be pliable and agreeable with people. And just as a necklace is sometimes seen but mostly not seen, so too one should mostly stay at home engrossed in his studies. 
<br />
<br />
The Proverbs say, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2805.htm">She (meaning, your study) is a lovely hind who effuses charm</a>.” Just as a hind, whose womb is narrow, and therefore she is beloved to her mate every time as the first time, so too the words of one's learning give one pleasure every time he reviews them.
<br />
<br />
The same proverb continues, “Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; may you always be insane in her love.” What is this comparison? Just as a baby who touches the breast and always finds milk, so too those who repeat their learning always find pleasure in it. And they should be “insane” to the point of forgetting their daily needs. They say about Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat that when he was studying in the lower part of the market in Tzippori, he would forget his cloak in the upper part of the market.

Eruvin 55 – How Moses taught

Then Aaron would enter the tent of Moses, sit right across him, and Moses would teach him the portion. Then Aaron would sit to the side of Moses, the two sons of Aaron would enter, and Moses taught them. Then the rest of the Sages would come in, and Moses taught them. Then the rest of the people were taught by Moses.
<br />
<br />
By now, Aaron has heard it four times. Moses would leave, and now Aaron teaches everybody. Then Aaron leaves, and his sons teach. The the sons leave, and the Sages teach. Thus everybody gets a chance to hear the lesson four times. Why would not Moses teach all the time? – To give that distinction to the others.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Preida had a student to whom he would have to repeat the lesson four hundred times before he understood it. One day, Rabbi Preida had to go to do a mitzvah, so he taught the student the usual four hundred times and was preparing to leave, when the student told him that he did not understand it this time, since every minute he was saying to himself, “Soon my teacher will leave.” Rabbi Preida said, “Sit and I will teach you,” and taught him another four hundred times. A heavenly voice asked him, “Do you want that four hundred years be added to your life, or that you and your generation merit the life in the World to Come?” Rabbi Preida chose the World to Come, but God himself intervened and said, “Give him both.”

Houses that protrude beyond the rectangular shape of the city itself add to the techum, since measuring begins from them.

When one draws the rectangular techum boundary around a city, he aligns it with the directions of the world, north, south, east, and west. For this, he can use the stars: Taurus will point out the north, and Scorpio – the south. If he does not know how to find these constellations, he can use the sun. On the longest day of the year the sun rises and sets in two points which together indicate the north, and on the shortest day of the year he can determine the south. The Talmud continues discussing the constellations  and their influences on the world.
<br />
<br />
In measuring the rectangular area of the techum (or a square for a round city), one makes sure to include the corners, thus gaining more walkable distance. When there is a possibility of drawing the techum in two different ways, he should prefer the one that gives more room. In general, the law of the techum follows the Sage with the most lenient opinion. That is because the two thousand steps limitation on walking on Shabbat and Festival is only a safeguard around the fifteen thousand limit prescribed by the Torah.

The extra "and outward" tells us that we need to add the area of a backyard (about seventy steps) before the two thousand steps begin. 
<br />
<br />
This, however, is only the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Other Sages had a different tradition about this law: while it is true that the concept of adding a backyard exists, it is only applicable to two separate nearby cities, as follows. Each city is given an additional backyard, and if these backyards intersect, then the cities are considered as one, and the two-thousand step techum is measured for them together.

Eruvin 58 – The act of measuring

Both surveyors must hold their end of the rope next to the heart. If one, for example, would measure next to the heart and the other next to the head, they would be shortchanging the eruv. 
<br />
<br />
If, while measuring, they reached a valley or a stone fence which are less then fifty steps wide, they pull the rope straight over these obstacles, and continue measuring. This is called spanning the mountain. If the hill is very high, they can use poles to pass the rope over.
<br />
<br />
If the hill or mountain is large, they "pierce through it" by walking up the hill, with one of them holding the rope at his heart and the other – at his feet, in such a way that the rope is always parallel to the horizon. In no event are they allowed to leave the area of the techum while measuring, for if they do, the onlookers might think that the techum reaches to the place where they were. 
<br />
<br />
Spanning and piercing the mountains are a leniency, because they allow for longer distances. By contrast, in measuring for the laws of the city of refuge, where accidental killers run, and the decapitated calf, which atones for an unsolved murder case by burning the calf and washing the hands – for these laws one measures along the walking path, which results in a shorter distance.

If, nevertheless, he made mistake and his measurement was not a perfect rectangle, we accept the side with the longer measurement – because of the rule that in techum we follow the most lenient approach possible.<br />
<br />
A town may be surrounded by a fence, common food may be placed in one of the houses, and this will create an “eruv” which will permit the people of the town to carry in its streets on Shabbat. Even so, one must leave an area of the town outside the eruv. This is needed mostly for the children: they will know that there is an area of town where carrying is prohibited, and will be reminded of the laws of not carrying on Shabbat and of the eruv. However, if the town belongs to one owner, one can include all of it in the eruv, and he does not need to leave a part outside an eruv. So too, if the town used to belong to one individual but grew, and now belongs to many, one can still include it all in one eruv, because of the town's prior history. On the other hand, if the town used to belong to multiple owners but now belongs to one, leaving a portion of it outside the eruv is required.
<br />
<br />
How large should be the portion outside the eruv? – As large as the town which used to be in Judea called “Chadashah,” with the population of fifty people. Some say, three courtyards with at least two houses each.

In order to carry in such alley, a beam across is entrance is required, to remind everyone that carrying in the street is forbidden.
<br />
<br />
An alley that is completely open on both side is too similar to a street, and it cannot be fixed in the same way; instead, one needs to construct an door-like entrance on one side, even if it is only a few sticks that have the silhouette of a door. 
<br />
<br />
What happens if the alley bends at ninety degrees in the middle? One can say that it is not open, but rather ends in another alley. This is the point of view of Rav,  and one can carry in the alley fixed with a beam. Or one can say that it is simply a bent alley, open on both sides, and it is like  a street. This is the point of view of Shmuel.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, when we spoke of a street, we always implied that if it is wide enough (sixteen amot, about 30 feet), then it is automatically considered a public areas. Not everyone thinks that way; some say that the city needs to have six hundred thousand people living there, and otherwise it is never a public area where the Torah forbade carrying. This last discussion has direct ramifications related to modern-day eruv, which usually permits people carrying in the street – but not according to every opinion.

The residents of a town of Kakunaei came to Rav Yosef, asking him to appoint someone to&nbsp;arrange&nbsp;an eruv for them, so that they should be permitted to carry in it on Shabbat. Rav Yosef appointed Abaye, telling him, “Make sure they don't complain.” He meant to do it right by properly observing the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/05/eruvin-59-city-of-one-owner.html">rules of exclusion</a>.<br />
<br />
Abaye saw in the town some houses that opened toward the river, without an opening toward the city. He said, “Let these houses be the ones excluded from the eruv.” However, he then reconsidered, saying that the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/05/eruvin-59-city-of-one-owner.html">rule stated &nbsp;“excluded,”</a> which means that they potentially could be included, and these houses cannot be included anyway, because their courtyards don't open into the city.
<br />
<br />
He then thought of asking them to make windows in those houses. However, then he reconsidered again, citing a different precedent with ditches separating neighborhoods which nevertheless joined in a common eruv. Then he reconsidered again, because in the precedent of ditches they could use roofs for connection, had they wanted to, but it was not so in the town of Kakunaei. Again he considered making windows. And then he remembered a case where a storehouse, where people did not even live, was used as an excluded area, and thus concluded that waterfront houses could be used to satisfy the exclusion rule. Then he said, “That is was Rav Yosef meant, saying that they should not complain – I could have forced them to make windows for no purpose.”
<br />
<br />
If one told his son to place his eruv to the east of town, for him being able to walk there on Shabbat, but the son placed it more than two thousand steps away – it is invalid, and he keeps the techum of his town.

Why?
<br />
<br />
Residents of both towns were measuring their techum (walking distance on Shabbat). The techum of the small town dwellers ended in the middle of the large town, and they were not allowed to go any further. However, the eruv of the large town dwellers overran the complete small town. In that case, the complete small town counts as if it was only 4 steps, and the residents of the large town thus gained a large distance (the complete size of the small town minus four steps) added to their eruv.
<br />
<br />
Had they placed their eruv food in the other town, they would always count the town as four steps, and in addition have two thousand steps beyong. Rabbi Akiva disagrees with this last rule. He said to the Sages, "Don't you agree that if one places the eruv in a cave, he only has two thousand steps around himself?" They answered, "Yes, but that it because the cave is not inhabited. By contrast, an inhabited city counts as only four steps, and you have two thousand steps around."

If so, one can carry in this courtyard, because nobody is going to confuse this situation with carrying in a public street. However, one who does not agree with the rules of the eruv cannot join it.
<br />
<br />
What is to be done? The residents of the courtyard can rent the rights of carrying from the idolater by giving him money or food. They need his agreement for that, but even that of his wife or his servant will also suffice.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov adds the the idolater only restricts when there are at least two Jews in the same courtyard, and Rabbi Meir says that even for one Jewish resident it is a problem. What is their disagreement? Rabbi Eliezer is of the opinion that it is unusual for one Jew to live with an idolater, because he would be afraid to be killed – and the Sages never make their decrees for unusual situations. If so, what does Rabbi Meir reply? – He says that occasionally a Jew may be forced to live alone with an idolater, and thus the eruv limitation still applies.<br />

This was especially applicable in the times of the Talmud, because often a student would receive all of his Torah knowledge from one teacher, rather than from a school or from multiple published books, and also because the Sages of the Talmud were on a very high level of personal integrity and actually fulfilled in their lives what they taught in their lessons.
<br />
<br />
As an example, when Eldad and Meidad were not selected into the Sanhedrin, they became prophesying that Moses will not enter the Land of Israel but will die in the desert, and that Yehoshua will lead the Jews. On hearing this, Yehoshua did not contain himself and said “My master Moses, lock them up!” Since this was a legal decision that Moses had to make, Yehoshua was punished by not leaving over any sons to carry on his name.

However, there is a loophole: one can rent this person’s rights in the courtyard, and even from his servant. One can also become friendly with the person, do him some service, and be considered his servant for this.<br />
<br />
On hearing this rule, Rav Nachman said, “How nice is it!” However, on hearing another rule, that one who drank wine (even 2-3 ounces) cannot render legal decisions, he said, “This is not nice. I, for one, cannot  judge until I clear my mind with wine.” However, Rava quoted to him, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2829.htm">One who sees prostitutes will lose his wealth</a>.” The word “prostitutes,” “zonot” in Hebrew, can be understood as “zo nae”, which means “this one is nice,” so allegorically one he says “this law is nice, this one is not” will lose his learning. Rav Nachman said, “I am convinced and change my mind .”<br />

<br />
<br />
However, even if they did not do so, there is still a device they can use: one of them, who has not joined the eruv, can give away his rights in the courtyard so that he does not prohibit the others to carry.  Even if all did not join the eruv, they can all give their rights to one of them, and be permitted to carry.
<br />
<br />
However, Shmuel formulated three rules which sound like “if they forbid – they can make an eruv,” and which teach that giving away the rights is only a dispensation given when necessary and if, had the eruv been made, it would have been effective.

The Sages of Nehardea told them an unexpectedly strict ruling: they had to put up two doors, one at each of the two bends. This followed the strictness of Rav, who required the door shape (although not an actual door), but also the strictness of Shmuel, who in a different situation required an actual door, although he did not need it in the case of a bent alley.
<br />
<br />
How could the Sages do this? They could completely follow either Rav or Shmuel, and that would be fine. Had they followed the leniencies of both, they would be called dishonest, and for following the contradictory stringencies they should be by right called stupid, and the phrase, “A fool walks in darkness” would apply to them.
<br />
<br />
Actually, they followed Rav, but since the two door shapes are not easily noticeable, there was a danger that the people will not understand the fix and will behave leniently in other, different situations. As far as being called a fool for following multiple stringencies, this is only true if it can bring one to violate other laws, but not if they can co-exist.

What happens if these two courtyards have a common wall, and in addition there is a window in this wall?
<br />
<br />
In this situation, the window can help both ways. If they want, they can consider the window as connecting the courtyards, making it in fact one courtyard, and then they can make a common eruv for all the residents in both courtyards, so that they can even pass things through that window. Or, if they prefer, they can say that the window does not matter, that the wall between them is a valid partition, dividing them into separate areas, so that each courtyard can make its own eruv.
<br />
<br />
This is all true, however, only if the window is at least four hand-breadths tall and four hand-breadths wide, and is within ten hand-breadths from the ground. If it is either too small or too high from the ground – they have no choice and must consider the courtyards as two completely separate areas.

<br />
<br />
If there are fruits on top of the wall, then the residents of each courtyard may go up on the wall and eat the fruit while being there. The wall is a separate private area; there is nothing wrong with going there, as well as nothing wrong with eating there. However, none of the courtyard's residents can bring the fruit down into his courtyard, because the wall is not part of an eruv, and he would be transferring from one private domain to another private domain – and that is exactly what the Sages prohibited, in order that the people living in courtyards have some reminder that carrying on Shabbat from a public area (street) to a private area (courtyard) is prohibited by the Torah.

This eruv will allow the residents of each courtyard to carry in it, but not into the other courtyard. Even if they fill the ditch with stubble or straw, it still separates them, because those materials will not remain there but will likely be removed. If, however, they fill the ditch with earth or pebbles, then – since those materials will likely stay n there – the ditch has been effectively closed, and they can make only one&nbsp;eruv for all of them.
<br />
<br />
If they put a board of at least four hand-breadths wide over the ditch, then now they have a choice. If they want, then can look at this board as a connector that allows them to join in a mutual eruv. Or, they can view this board as merely a bridge but not a connector, and create individual eruv for each of the two courtyards.

<br />
<br />
The residents of one courtyard can feed their animals from the haystack, and so can the residents of the other courtyard. Potentially, one might be concerned that the animals will eat the haystack up, making it less than ten hand-breadths in height, and in this way nullifying the partition. The rule above tells us exactly that: we should not be concerned about such a possibility since normally animals don't eat that much in the course of one Shabbat. 
<br />
<br />
However, if the animals ate enough of the straw during the week before Shabbat, and the height of the haystack is lower than ten hand-breadths on a section that is at least ten amot (20 feet) long – the haystack no longer serves as a partition; the people in both courtyards have to join in a common eruv, and they can no longer use their individual eruv for each courtyard.

The garbage made a fence going up, and the sea wall was a fence going down, so it should have been permitted to carry in this alley, but Rabbi Yehudah the Prince would neither permit nor prohibit carrying there. Why? He did not want to prohibit, because after all it had partitions on both sides; he did not want to permit, because the garbage heap might eventually be removed, while the sea might be made shallow with sand, thus obliterating the partitions and making it in the future forbidden to carry.
<br />
<br />
But why should such future considerations be taken into account? Because it is possible that one will decide to remove the garbage. And, this is a concern only the case of an individual, but if the garbage is communal, then carrying is allowed – because it is very rare that a communal garbage heap will be moved with mutual agreement.

In addition to collecting food from all residents in each courtyard, the different courtyards in an alley have to collect food for the common “alley eruv,” in order to allow carrying on Shabbat between courtyards. Practically, however, it may  be too burdensome, so instead one can act as follows: he takes a barrel of his own food and declares, “Let this belong to all the residents of the alley.” The declaration alone won’t suffice though, since in every transaction there must be a recipient. Therefore, he asks someone independent of him, even a servant, but not a dependent child, to acquire the barrel on their behalf.
<br />
<br />
How much food does there have to be? Even the amount of two meals for one person is enough, since this is a significant amount of food, and every one of them can eat it. This amount of food is needed only at the beginning of Shabbat. Later on, if some of it was eaten or lost, it does not matter, as long as a little bit is still extant. Why this leniency? The whole purpose of the eruv is to remind children that carrying in the street on Shabbat is prohibited, as evidenced by the elaborate eruv procedure. Once this goal has been accomplished, some of the food can be eaten.

Eruvin 81 – Which food for eruv?

As long as it is edible, food is considered uniting people. However, Rabbi Yehoshua says that it can be only bread, for otherwise people in the courtyard will not take it seriously. Moreover, it should be whole loaves of bread: a large broken piece cannot be used, whereas a small whole loaf can. Why? – Eruv is used to promote peace between neighbors, and there should be no jealousy, which may result if some people contribute pieces of bread, and some – whole loaves.
<br />
<br />
If one has a baker living in his courtyard, and he gives that baker a coin, asking him to contribute bread on his behalf, it is not valid. Why? – The Sages instituted multiple ways of acquisition but took away the power of money payment to acquire things, rather, the actual delivery has to take place, for fear that a seller may stop caring after receiving the payment. Therefore, his coin did not acquire bread for him, and not a part in the eruv. By contrast, if he gave money to a private person, asking to provide bread, this works. The private person would be willing to contribute bread even for free, and the money is regarded as a payment for his  service.

If one wants to change this limit, he can place food some distance away from his residence, and this then becomes the center of his new residence area. The residence area (techum) is rectangular, measured from his city, from his house, or from his place if he is not in a house or a city.
<br />
<br />
What if all the residents of a city want to move the limits of their residence (techum) for a particular Shabbat? A messenger can be chosen to take a barrel of food to the new site and place it there, and he also has to acquire it on behalf of all the residents. Whoever of the residents accepts the new residence area on himself before dark, that person can use it, but it is not possible to affect this acceptance after dark when Shabbat has already started.<br />
<br />
In addition, one can only change his residence area for the purpose of a mitzvah, such as going to a house of mourning or a wedding banquet.

If he is making it for many people, then there should be enough for two meals for each. However, this does not mean complete food for two meals, but rather, if he uses, for instance, pies, there should be enough pies to go with two meals. This is true for every type of food.
<br />
<br />
How large is the size of a meal? Rabbi Meir says that we measure be average weekday meal, since on weekdays one eats less, and on Shabbat he eats more, due to the excellent taste of the food. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that we measure by Shabbat meals, since, on the contrary, on Shabbat one eats less, leaving room for the obligatory third meal of the day. We see that both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehudah intended to have less food required for the eruv.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud continues with other opinions on the measures of the volume of a meal. Some are expressed depending on how much flour one can buy given a specific flour price per pound. Others are based on measures of volume. All are tied to the amount of the manna that was given to the Jews in the desert daily. This is calculated to be the volume of 43.2 average eggs, and it is considered a healthy amount for one’s meal.

The residents of the upper floor ascend there through a staircase, and there is a balcony, or “gallery,” on the second floor. They constitute two different courtyards: the residents living on each level have to make their own eruv (common food) in order to carry on their level on Shabbat. 
<br />
<br />
In addition, they need to make a common eruv between the two floors, something that we previously called the eruv of the alley. What happens when they forget to make the common eruv? – The residents of the upper floor can carry there and in all adjoining areas, and so too the residents of the lower level. Should the residents of the upper floor forget their own eruv, they prohibit carrying not only on their floor, but also on the lower one in the courtyard, because they have the right to go through this courtyard, and they bring with them the limitation that they themselves have.<br />
<br />
Which area is considered adjoining to the second level? Any that has the height of ten hand-breadths and which, in addition, is not farther than four hand-breadths from the balcony. This can be, for example, the embankment of a pit or a well situated in the courtyard.<br />

If there is a mound of earth, which extends both courtyards, to whom does it belong? Obviously, it is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/05/eruvin-76-window.html">the same case as a window</a>&nbsp;between two courtyards. If the mound is high, it is obviously the same case as a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/05/eruvin-77-wall.html">wall between courtyards</a>.<br />
<br />
What if there is a mound which is high for the residents of one courtyard, so that they need to reach or throw things there, but low for the residents of the other, so that they lower things down to it? Here it is not obvious, and Shmuel says that it belongs to the residents of the upper courtyard, who lower things to it - since lowering is easier than reaching. His proof is from the balcony case before, where he assumes that the balcony is between two floors, giving the second-floor sufficient height – and there the mound belonged to the people of the upper floor. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rav disagrees and says that lowering and reaching are equally inconvenient, and thus the mound belongs to both and is prohibited to both. He says that the circumstances of the balcony case are different: the second floor is level with the balcony, not higher than it, and thus the people don’t have to lower things from it onto the mound: the case is different and gives no support to Shmuel.

Rabbi Shimon says that he does not, since it is highly unusual for people to return once they left for Shabbat – with the exception of a parent visiting his or her daughter-in-law, because then if there is a quarrel, it has a tendency to continue.
<br />
<br />
If there is water, for example, in a cistern, between two courtyards, then when the residents of one courtyard draw water, they are drawing from the other courtyard – because water always mixes – and in the absence of a common eruv, it is prohibited. What is to be done? They must put up a separation, a wall within a cistern. Even an incomplete wall, which only partially shows up and is partially submerged in water, is sufficient – provided that it is ten handbreadths high. There are multiple opinions on the exact position of this separating wall, but all agree that this is a leniency that the Sages gave to the water and that a partial “hanging” separation will not suffice on dry land.

This is because the channel comes from a river, and river is a special area, called “karmelit,” <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/10/shabbat-7-special-area-called-karmelit.html">which we discussed earlier</a>, and carrying from which is not allowed.
<br />
<br />
The only solution that they have is to put up a separation ten hand-breadths high at the channel's entrance into the courtyard and at its exit. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that the wall of the courtyard itself can be considered such separation. Rabbi Yehudah brings a proof: “There was a channel in the city of Avel which flowed through multiple coutyards of the city, and the Sages allowed drawing water to every courtyard!” However, Rabbi Yehudah’s opponents replied that this incident is no proof, because the channel was not high and wide enough to represent a significant separate area.

The Sages called such area a “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/10/shabbat-7-special-area-called-karmelit.html">karmelit</a>” &nbsp;and prohibited carrying from it to the private domain on Shabbat. Therefore, one cannot draw water to his balcony. To permit this, he must create a fence, a partition either above or below the balcony. The walls of the partition will be considered as if going down to the water level, making this part of the water into his private area, where carrying is permitted.<br />
<br />
If one’s courtyard is small, smaller than four by four steps, then he should not pour refuse water into it, because the water will inevitably run outside, and he will have caused it to go from his courtyard into the street. If he makes a cesspool, containing at least 2 se’ah (6 liters) of water, then pouring is allowed. It can be assumed that an average person won’t use more than this amount of water, so it will not flow out. Another way to permit pouring into the courtyard is by building a covered passageway for the water, flowing into the street. In this case, it can be assumed that the water will be absorbed into the ground in the passageway – and if not, its flow into the street will still be unintended, which the Sages did not prohibit.

The Sages disagree and say that just as all courtyards are separate areas, so too all roofs are separate areas.
<br />
<br />
We can understand the Sages, but Rabbi Meir's position seems inconsistent: if all roofs are one area, then what does the difference in height of ten hand-breadths matter? – Rabbi Meir is concerned that if people get used to stepping up and down the roofs, they may come to use a mound ten hand-breadths high, situated in a street, for their needs – and there it would clearly be not allowed.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon gives a new rule which changes our understanding of the laws of eruv so far: all roofs - and even all courtyards - combine together into one area, and one can carry there – talking about objects which started Shabbat in a courtyard but not in a house. Thus, if an object was in a house at the beginning of Shabbat, the laws and limitations of eruv apply to it. But if it was in a courtyard, then one can take it to another courtyard even without an eruv.

Had the beam been placed normally, the one who permits carrying directly under the beam does so because he considers the outer edge of the beam as if doing down and separating the alley from the street. Accordingly, when the beam is too far from the alley, it does not help, and carrying in the alley is forbidden. 
<br />
<br />
By contrast, one who usually forbids carrying under the beam says so because he considers the inner edge of the beam as if going down and separating the alley. Therefore, the beam on two pegs, even though it is in the street, has its inner edge is right next to the alley, so it does separate the alley from the street, which means that carrying there is allowed.
<br />
<br />
Nice as this logic was, Rava disagreed with it, saying simply that the beam should be right over the alley. Since this is not true in our case, a beam on the pegs is invalid, and so is the law.

All of them are about walls and roofs. 
<br />
<br />
Take, for example, a ship. Rav says that on Shabbat one can carry throughout the entire ship, and Shmuel says that he is allowed to carry objects for only four steps. What is each one’s logic? Rav considers the ship a private area because it is surrounded by the ship’s walls, which make it into a closed partition. However, Shmuel claims that these walls are not made to surround the ship on the sides, but rather to keep the water outside, so they don’t count. 
<br />
<br />
However, even Rav agrees that if one turns the ship upside down, one cannot carry in the area under the ship. Why not? If one intends to live there, it is no worse than a house! – Rather, we are talking about a situation where one overturned the ship in order to tar it. Here the walls are definitely not made to surround the area under the ship – rather, they expose their external side for being tarred. Therefore, they are not considered partitions around the ship, and one cannot carry under it.

Earlier, we saw <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/06/eruvin-89-all-roofs.html">the opinion of Rabbi Shimon</a>, who said that all roofs and all courtyards are considered as one area and do not need an eruv. Any object that was in a courtyard at the start of Shabbat on Friday night can be freely carried to another courtyard. Since this opinion will become the law, the Talmud investigates it further.
<br />
<br />
Rav says that this leniency applies only if they have not made an eruv. However, if they did, this leniency is not needed: at the very least, people can take things from their houses into their own courtyard, and this is enough.
<br />
<br />
However, Shmuel could not understand his reason: if all roofs are one area, what does it matter if the people made an eruv (common food) or not? Rav Chisda explained that either position has its problems. If we always allow carrying things in the courtyard, just like Shmuel said, people will be utterly confused: things that started Shabbat in a courtyard can be carried to another courtyard, but things that originally were in a house cannot!? Now different things have different laws for carrying!
<br />
<br />
However, this indeed may be the case, according to Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Shimon trusts people’s intelligence and believes that they won’t be confused. In fact, there was a similar case of three adjoining courtyards where the law depended on which courtyard the object came from, and Rabbi Shimon did not make any additional precautions.

Eruvin 92 – Two roofs, a large and a small one

If there are two adjoining roofs over two houses, a large one and a small one, then it is permitted to carry on a large one, but it is forbidden to carry on a small one on Shabbat. Why? We need to explain both parts of this rule.
<br />
<br />
The roofs are not surrounded by walls, or partitions, they are just flat roofs on top of the houses, so how could any roof be considered a private area where it is permitted to carry? We see here a new principle, “extend the wall:” the walls of the houses that go down can be extended up and serve as imaginary partitions surrounding the roof. We understand now why it can be permitted to carry on the large roof.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the small roof is considered simply an opening, a door for the large one, which does not upset its status as a private area. However, the small roof is completely open to the large one. It is not just an opening or a door, it takes away one of the small roof’s wall partitions. The small roof is then like a courtyard with a missing wall, open into the street, and one cannot carry in such a courtyard, and consequently on this small roof, as we have seen at <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/03/eruvin-2-houses-courtyard-alley.html">the very beginning of Eruvin</a>.

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/06/eruvin-92-two-roofs-large-and-small-one.html">Previously we learned</a> that when two roofs or two courtyards, a large one and a small one, are adjoining, they are not equal: the small one is subordinate to the large one. The residents of the large one can carry in a small one, but not the other way around.
<br />
<br />
To emphasize this, Rabbah gave examples. If nine people are in the large courtyard and one is on the small one – they add up for prayer, but if nine are in the small courtyard and one is in the large one, he does not add up. If one planted grapevines in the large courtyard, then it is forbidden to plant wheat in the small one because one cannot plant the two together, and the small courtyard is considered to be part of the large one; however, if one planted grapevines in the small courtyard, then it is permitted to plant wheat in the large one because they are separate.
<br />
<br />
Abaye found the last rule very hard to understand: in fact, the separation between the two courtyards, in the form of an entrance, made planting forbidden! Had there not been a separation, it would have been enough to distance the plantings by four steps.
<br />
<br />
The Sages showed Abaye many cases where some form of separation actually created additional prohibitions, but Abaye dismissed them all by explaining that in each case they were not the same, and thus Abaye remained with his surprise at the Rabbah’s ruling.

The Sages, however, say that the courtyard is not really public – people still do not walk there freely, but rather it is a “karmelit,” meaning an area through which passers-by go only occasionally. How could they disagree to this extent? The truth is that they don’t argue about the complete courtyard, but only about the area where the wall stood. Rabbi Eliezer says that people now do walk there, and the Sages – that they did not do walk there before and don’t really walk there even now.
<br />
<br />
If a courtyard was broken through on two sides, one can still carry there, but only this Shabbat, and not the next – these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah, but the Sages say that it should be consistent on every Shabbat. What is the situation? If the breach is less than ten steps – it is a door, and even two doors do not make the courtyard lose its private status. And if the breaches are wider than ten steps, then even one of them makes the courtyard open, and we do not need the case of two!? Rav explained that here we are dealing with a breach in the corner of the courtyard, and people don’t normally walk through such breaches. This is why even with two broken walls the courtyard can still retain its private status.

If, while the messenger is on his way, the husband changes his mind, the Get becomes invalid, and the divorce does not happen. Thus, the husband can change his mind while the messenger is en route.
<br />
<br />
Why don't we say it is good for the wife to become free, and therefore the messenger should acquire the Get on her behalf immediately, thus affecting the divorce? – That is because a divorce has certain disadvantages: the husband is no longer obligated to provide his wife with sustenance. The rule is that if something is unquestionably good, the messenger can acquire it on behalf of a receiving person, but not if there are minuses in such acquisition.
<br />
<br />
However, when the master sends an emancipation letter (also called Get) to his slave, he cannot change his mind. Freedom is unquestionably good, and the minute the messenger receives the Get, he acquires it for the slave, who now goes free – this is the opinion of the Sages. Rabbi Meir disagrees about the slave: his freedom has this drawback the master won't feed him. And the Sages? – They say that the master is allowed to stop feeding his slaves anyway. This may not be wise and is not sustainable, but since the master has this right, the slave actually loses nothing when he becomes free.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir told the Sages, "But if he is a slave of Kohen, he loses the right to eat the Kohen's portion. So that is a disadvantage!" To this, the Sages replied, "He loses it not because he is free, but because he is no longer the acquisition of a Kohen. So he loses nothing - therefore, let him be free; the master cannot change his mind."<br />
<br />
However, what about the slave of a regular Jew, not a Kohen? What does he lose by getting freedom? - He gains by being able to marry a Jewess!! - No, he loses the availability of female slaves, who are cheap to get, available and permissive.<br />

Why? <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/10/kiddushin-14-why-death-of-husband-sets.html">When the husband dies, the wife is free</a>. Because of that, divorce after death does not make sense.<br />


<br />
A parallel situation is the Get of a slave: if the master dies and nobody inherits the slave, he is free by himself, and giving him a Get now is meaningless. And if someone does inherit, then this slave is no longer in the domain of the dead man to give him freedom.
<br />
<br />
However, if one says, "Give a hundred zuz ($5,000) to a certain person," and then he dies, the heirs are obligated to give the money to the named recipient. This is not obvious at all. There was no act of acquisition, "Give him money" are just words. Once the man dies, normal inheritance laws should take effect, meaning that his estate goes to his closest relatives. Therefore, Rav wanted to say that perhaps this is only talking about money on the shelf, which had previously been given as a deposit, or that the man who said these words was dying. In that special case, the money is considered already given; otherwise, the dying person would die even sooner.
<br />
<br />
However, the law is correct in all cases, and they do fulfill the will of the deceased.

Gittin 17 – When Rabba bar bar Channa got sick

He said, "No, they don't." He then presented a new argument: "If they  testified that the husband divorced her, they would be believed, no? So we should believe them that the Get is valid."<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a Persian follower of the cult of "Chabar" came and extinguished their candles because, at the time of the "Chabar" holidays, the light was allowed only in their temples of idol worship. Rabba bar bar Channa said, "God, either protect us here or exile us to the Roman empire, for at least they come from Esau!" But we learned that Persia was better!? – Yes, it was before the "Chabar" people came.
<br />
<br />
A divorce document (Get) must have a date in it. Therefore, if they started writing it in the afternoon, but by the time the witnesses got to signing, it was night – it is already another day, the Get is invalid and must be rewritten. On the other hand, if they started at night, they can sign it the next morning because it is still the same calendar day.
<br />
<br />
And why do they require a date in the Get? – A man is allowed to marry his sister's daughter. In fact, there were times when this was commendable. Since he marries his niece, he may exhibit avuncular behavior. For example, to protect her in case she is unfaithful to him, he may give her a Get without a date. Now if she is ever caught being unfaithful, she can bring the Get to court and claim that she was already divorced at the time of unfaithfulness. Others say that this is rare and that the date on the Get is needed to support monetary claims.

As we mentioned earlier, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/12/gittin-17-when-rabba-bar-bar-channa-got.html">it could be to prevent the husband from covering up on the unfaithful wife or to prevent the husband from unfairly using his wife's property</a>.<br />
<br />
But consider the following scenario: a man fights with his wife, goes and asks a scribe to write a Get for her, but then carries it with him for a long time, hoping that the situation will improve, and nevertheless divorces later. This is valid, but the date in the Get will be incorrect. So what helps that the date is there? – People usually do not rush evil tidings, and one will not write a Get in advance.
<br />
<br />
But consider a standard case discussed on the first page: <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/12/gittin-2-messenger-of-divorce.html">a messenger brings a Get from overseas</a>. The date on it is undoubtedly way early compared to the giving of the Get! – In such cases, due to the court proceeding, it is well known when the divorce occurred, and all know that the date on the Get is incorrect.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud asks more questions about the date in the Get and concludes that it can be relied on in most cases and that the exceptions can be dealt with separately.

Gittin 2 – A messenger of divorce

He can even appoint a messenger to bring and give her the Get.
<br />
<br />
In case he appoints a messenger, and this messenger comes from overseas, there is an additional requirement for him. He has to verify that he saw the Get written by the scribe and signed by the witnesses. Why this requirement? – People outside of Israel were not experts in divorce laws and might have missed a critical condition: that the Get is written for the specific woman the husband wants to divorce. It cannot, therefore, be written in advance, nor can a printed form be used. So if the scribe or the witnesses miss this, the Get would be invalid, even though the document would look OK, and this could create a problem later on. This is the opinion of Rabbah. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbah's student, Rava, said that the reason is different: people who live overseas stay overseas, and should the husband protest the Get and claim that it is forged, it would be hard to find these witnesses and make them testify in court. Thus, the husband could nullify the Get, which could also create a problem. 
<br />
<br />
What does it matter what the reason is if the messenger has to say these words, "written and signed in front of me" anyway? – For example, if two messengers came. The reason Rava – that they can't find two witnesses would not apply any longer, so they don't need to make the statement. But the logic of Rabbah – that they may not write the document specifically for her – would still apply, and accordingly they would have to talk about how it was written and signed.

Gittin 21 – What to write the Get on?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAsp9i40NNhEBVZdGnzb7xswPtnX8Wcmm4MPu2CA87wMPssA2OR6uDvV8N65wggp2gR5SaPmA6K8yI_nZBctaMrDwJvfClvWrsVnRhdnOGJ7ZnJQbqW7cE9mXsMw_RhQYTe3sYTanLTO5Y/s1600/Walnut+Tree+in+a+Thomery+Field+by+Alfred+Sisley.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="256" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAsp9i40NNhEBVZdGnzb7xswPtnX8Wcmm4MPu2CA87wMPssA2OR6uDvV8N65wggp2gR5SaPmA6K8yI_nZBctaMrDwJvfClvWrsVnRhdnOGJ7ZnJQbqW7cE9mXsMw_RhQYTe3sYTanLTO5Y/s320/Walnut+Tree+in+a+Thomery+Field+by+Alfred+Sisley.jpg" width="320" /></a>Can one write a Get on a giant leaf growing on a tree, then tear it off and give it to his wife? – No! Since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=24">And he will write for her a letter of divorce and give it</a>," we understand that he must be able to give the Get immediately after writing. Here we have another action, tearing off, intervening between writing the Get and giving it; therefore, such Get is invalid. If he did, however, write on a leaf, tore it off, and gave it to his wife, he did not do things correctly, but the divorce is valid.
<br />
<br />
The last rule is in direct contradiction with the previous one! We just  finished explaining why the Get is invalid, using the "He will write and give" - in one breath – and now we are saying that it is valid after all!?
<br />
<br />
The answer is that there are two components to the Get. The first is the "active" or "explicit," which effects the divorce. It gives the names of the husband and wife, the place, and the date. It also contains the key phrase, "You are free to marry anyone." This "active" part was initially left out on the leaf; only the secondary part was there. The active component was written in after the leaf was detached, so the Get was written correctly.
<br />
<br />
The explanation above may sound forced. Another explanation is that we are dealing with the opinion of Rabbi Meir that writing does not matter; only signing by the witnesses does, and it accomplishes the divorce. And they signed after the leaf was torn off the tree. This sounds more natural; why did they give the first explanation at all? – Because of the rule that in divorces, the law follows Rabbi Elazar, not Rabbi Meir, so they did not want to ascribe this rule to him.

Gittin 22 – Who can write the Get?

It goes without saying that a woman can write a Get, provided that she transfers its ownership to the husband, who can then give "his" Get to her. It is not the writing of the Get that matters; it is the signatures of the witnesses!
<br />
<br />
That rule sounds a bit strange: can we assume, for example, that a deranged person fulfills the requirement of writing a Get having in his mind that it is for a specific woman? – We have to say that someone who knows watches him and commands him what to do. What about the signatures of the witness? – We know that the law is like Rabbi Elazar, that it is the witnesses of giving the Get who matter!? – True, the rule assumes that the signing witnesses will be there for the continuation of the proceedings and will witness the giving of the Get as well, as is usually the case.
<br />
<br />
Another explanation is that this is a tongue-in-cheek rule. It emphasizes the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who says that only the signatures of witnesses matter – according to this, even a deranged person can write a Get.
<br />
<br />
Who can bring the Get if the husband can't come? Basically, anyone but here, the deranged person and the deaf-mute are excluded because they would have to testify that they saw the Get is written and signed. The Talmud goes into complications of someone under bar-mitzvah age when accepted the Get and started the journey, but then grew up, or someone who was normal became deranged on the way and possibly became lucid again.

Gittin 3 – Why did we believe the messenger?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3HJwM4TifnZacCrnBaem4Y6PQsXHMIWlHT6B-fuIOoF8p2FEckRrQzrT_fKawjZE_Espp5UJXkBUsm6q2M0qgdr6HHPr63kZ1D2zAA0WXYwv6Qih0_veEZJTjqsW1nqkXCqBCios9O-Q_/s1600/The+Messenger+by+Johannes+Verkolje.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3HJwM4TifnZacCrnBaem4Y6PQsXHMIWlHT6B-fuIOoF8p2FEckRrQzrT_fKawjZE_Espp5UJXkBUsm6q2M0qgdr6HHPr63kZ1D2zAA0WXYwv6Qih0_veEZJTjqsW1nqkXCqBCios9O-Q_/s320/The+Messenger+by+Johannes+Verkolje.jpg" width="280" /></a>Earlier, we said that a husband can divorce his wife through a messenger. As long as the messenger (who comes from overseas) brings the divorce document (Get) and states that he saw it being written and signed, the divorce can proceed. 
<br />
<br />
But why do we believe the messenger at all? After all, we have a rule that there should always be two witnesses. And if you tell me that this messenger testifies to the fact of a woman being divorced and that here one witness is enough, just as we believe anybody when he says that the food he or she prepared is kosher, then I will answer that this is not the same. About kosher food, I have no prior knowledge, but the woman was known to be married, and now he is testifying to a change of status, an event, and two witnesses should be needed. 
<br />
<br />
So then, how do we believe one messenger? – The answer is that the Sages established this so that it would be easier for a woman to get a divorce and to re-marry. But you might have another problem: in the absence of two witnesses, the husband may later claim that the Get was forged. – That is exactly the point: since the messenger knows that he will have to testify in court that he saw the Get being written and signed, he will make sure that it is completely proper. If the husband later protests, people will believe the messenger and not the husband.

Gittin 38 - The escape of a slave

If he disagrees, he is to let go after a year. He has rights: if his master harms him by cutting off a limb, even by knocking out his tooth, he goes free. He has obligations: he has to observe most of the mitzvot.<br />
<br />
What happens when this slave is captured by idolatrous robbers? Since the robbers will stop him from observing the mitzvot, one must repurchase this slave from the robbers. Does the slave then go free? - If the master still hopes to get the slave back, then if someone buys this slave to bring him back to the master, he remains the servant of his master. But if the one who redeems this slave wants him to go free, he indeed goes free. Why? - As far as the buyer is concerned - he redeemed the slave to freedom, so he cannot possibly become the new owner. Yet, the first master owns him!? - True, but he becomes free by the decree of the Sages: if the slave would go back to the master, then the freedom-loving redeemers would not have the motivation to redeem them.<br />
<br />
This is the opinion of Rava. Abaye investigates what happens when the master loses hope of getting the slave back. The slave then should become free simply because the master, in his mind, does not own him. The Talmud describes when a slave who has become free needs an additional Get granting him freedom and other cases of redemption.<br />

Gittin 39 – How can a slave free himself

There are two steps in his getting freedom: the master's ownership has to stop, and the slave needs to be legally freed in order to become a full-fledged Jew who can marry a Jewish woman.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, if a slave is declared "ownerless," this is only the first step; he needs to get a written bill of emancipation called Get. However, what about the rule that if a convert – who is like a new legal person, like a child born into the world, and who therefore does not have any legal inheritors – if this convert dies, then his slaves acquire themselves and are moreover become legally free, without a Get? – Death of the owner is different; this is similar to the death of a husband, which frees the wife without a Get.
<br />
<br />
Likewise, if a slave acquires himself with money, a Get is not required. But what about the following story: a man was dying, and his slave-woman screamed, "Until when will  that person (meaning herself) be a slave!?" So he threw her his hat as if saying, "Just as the hat exchanges ownership, so you acquire yourself." They went to Rav Nachman to confirm, and he said, "The man has accomplished nothing." This seems to mean that even though she acquired herself, a formal Get was still required! – Well, that is how people understood it, but they were wrong.
<br />
<br />
In truth, the problem was that that hat he threw belonged to him. The acquisition that he intended, as any acquisition done by giving a token (like a kerchief) to another, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/how-is-exchange-acquisition-performed.html">requires that the object belongs to the buyer (her), not the seller (him).</a> So the problem was that acquisition did not happen at all, but not that a Get was needed.

Rabbi Yochanan was surprised: "Are you certain? I know that one who marries a slave woman - even that is not a clear sign that he freed her!" Rabbi Zeira explained, "I mean when we see that the master helps with the ceremony."
<br />
<br />
Likewise, if a slave dons tefillin in front of his master, this is not yet a definite sign, but if the master assists the slave in donning tefillin, this is a sure sign that he has previously freed the slave.
<br />
<br />
Rav Dimi traveled to Israel and brought back the following story. At the time of this death, a certain man said, "This woman slave revived my spirit. Therefore, you, my sons, should revive her spirit." Rabbi Yochanan wanted to say that she should go free. But Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi told him, "Maybe she indeed deserves freedom, but why do you force the heirs to also lose her children, who would be their slaves?" However, the story needed to be corrected. Really, the decision was to ask her what would revive her spirit - and if she insists on being free - so be it! And why is that? - Because it is a mitzvah to fulfill the words of the dead. 
<br />
<br />
Earlier, we discussed <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/01/gittin-39-how-can-slave-free-himself.html">that one who makes his slave ownerless only effects the first step to freedom</a>. The slave still needs a Get. If now the master dies, the slave cannot rectify the situation since the master's heirs do not inherit the slave and, therefore, cannot free him. However, in many situations, Sages found a way to force the writing of a Get - because, without it, the slave could not get married.

Gittin 41 - A slave of two masters
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimePtG10152-eeb5G5DvnnPp4l__aZqdy4B1A1iS7_j191-X3i8MN2KczGALvE1woPGOqstHPAGSJ7j8WgoihE5BUEGCHgIhpH7wnHMYGE8WbA5u6QP5nbzC8K_9r-x-SscKdL7KdU9Yr3/s1600/The+Jewish+Wedding+by+Moritz+Oppenheim.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimePtG10152-eeb5G5DvnnPp4l__aZqdy4B1A1iS7_j191-X3i8MN2KczGALvE1woPGOqstHPAGSJ7j8WgoihE5BUEGCHgIhpH7wnHMYGE8WbA5u6QP5nbzC8K_9r-x-SscKdL7KdU9Yr3/s320/The+Jewish+Wedding+by+Moritz+Oppenheim.jpg" width="235" /></a>Imagine that someone makes his slave collateral for his loan so that if he does not repay, the lender acquires the slave. The master can still free the slave. However, the slave must write a promissory note for his value. To whom?
<br />
<br />
Some say that he writes it to the lender. In truth, the slave is free, but the Sages wanted to prevent a situation where the lender meets the former slave in the street and claims that this is his slave - implying that his children are children of a slave! Others say that the Sages force the lender to write a Get because he can sue the borrower for the value of the slave and get paid anyway.
<br />
<br />
If two people pull their money together and buy a slave, but then one makes his part of the slave free, then the slave works one day for the other owner and another day for himself. On Shabbat, he does not work. That is the opinion of Beit Hillel.
<br />
<br />
However, Beit Shammai argued: this slave could not marry a slave woman because he was part free. He cannot marry a free Jewish woman because he is part slave. Should he refrain from procreation altogether? But the earth "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1045.htm">was not created to be empty, but to be populated</a>." Therefore, Beit Shammai suggests that the second owner should be forced to free the slave and accept a note for half of his value from him. And Beit Hillel was convinced.

Gittin 42 – Vicissitudes of the slave of two masters
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9NIQ2lVB8J0Ces_9EtGIfNWpK_IG7gm11J2a60Sm4MQ_Pc_AE6AYbgrLP7GKj8rYw3HdgblWd9YsJ5N_ymibSlfQ5xoBW60L_495iUjr-LT17dCU6Tlhwk0gaCRtAUB2StAR4UAx95o4C/s1600/Lawyer+in+his+Study+by+Adriaen+Jansz.+Van+Ostade+.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9NIQ2lVB8J0Ces_9EtGIfNWpK_IG7gm11J2a60Sm4MQ_Pc_AE6AYbgrLP7GKj8rYw3HdgblWd9YsJ5N_ymibSlfQ5xoBW60L_495iUjr-LT17dCU6Tlhwk0gaCRtAUB2StAR4UAx95o4C/s320/Lawyer+in+his+Study+by+Adriaen+Jansz.+Van+Ostade+.jpg" width="256" /></a>The Talmud discussed how one can become a slave of two masters, especially how he can be a slave of one master and, in part, a free man. Then it describes what else can happen to such a slave.
<br />
<br />
For example, if an ox gores this slave, who receives the damages payments? – The answer is that if the goring happened on the day when this slave was working for the master, then the payment goes to the master because it is his property that was damaged. If, however, this happened on the day when the slave was working for himself, then the payments go directly to him, for he is a free man at this time.
<br />
<br />
If so, do we have a basis to allow him to marry a slave woman on those days when he is working for his master and a free woman when he is working for himself? – No, this far we don't go: money can indeed be divided, but prohibitions that are intrinsic to him cannot be divided to change their nature from day to day.
<br />
<br />
Imagine that the ox does not just gore this slave but actually kills him. In this case, if the ox was habitually goring people, the owner of the ox pays a penalty of thirty shekels for his gross negligence. Who does the payment go to? – Half goes to the master (because the slave is one-half his), and the other half – to the heirs of the slave. But we expected it depends on which day he dies, just like above!? – Above, the slave was still alive and would eventually recompense both his master and himself, but here the total capital is so-to-say gone, so the two sides divide the recompense.

Gittin 43 – Betting on the life of a slave

He will pay some amount now, and if this slave is indeed gored, then the penalty of thirty shekels, which the master would receive, will instead go to the trader. Is such a trade valid?
<br />
<br />
On the one hand, even Rabbi Meir, who validates buying next year's fruit of a tree, may disagree here: the tree is sure to bring fruit, but the slave might not be gored, and even if he is gored – there is a rule that if the owner of the ox admits his guilt, he does not pay the penalty.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, even the Sages who disagree with Rabbi Meir and who invalidate the sale of the following year's fruit may say that the slave's future trade is valid: after all, the slave is here, and the ox is also here, but the fruit is not. The question remains unanswered. 
<br />
<br />
Another question: Is this valid if a man who is half-slave and half-free betroths a woman? If a man betroths half of a woman, it is invalid because he left the other half free, and a wife needs to be acquired wholly. However, this slave does not leave out anything – so maybe this is valid. Consider an earlier rule of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/01/gittin-42-vicissitudes-of-slave-of-two.html">half-slave who was gored and whose payment went to his heirs</a>. If he has heirs, he must have a wife! So his betrothal must be valid!? – Not necessarily; maybe the teacher wanted to say, "Should go to his heirs, but he has none."<br />
<br />
Incidentally, one who betroths a half-slave and half-free woman indeed acquires her as a wife because he wants the whole woman and does not leave any part of her.

Gittin 44 – A flurry of unresolved questions about a slave

In particular, on emancipation, he was to acquire the full status of a “Son of Israel,” and even as a slave, he was already observing mitzvot.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, if someone sold his slave to an idolater (who would likely stop the slave from observing the mitzvot), the slave became legally free – this was the decree of the Sages. They have also added that the previous owner had to write for the slave a Get of emancipation. A special case is when the master wrote for the slave a letter that said, “When you flee,  I have no claims on you.” In this case, the Get would not be needed.
<br />
<br />
If one sold his slave (which normally involved a penalty on the master, in that the slave goes free), but he sold him only for thirty days, would the penalty still apply? What if he sold him on the condition that the slave does not do any work (but lives with a slave woman and helps her grow the children)? What if he sold him for work, but with the exception of Saturdays and Holidays? What if he sold the slave to a non-Jew who lives in Israel and observes the laws of Noah or to a non-observant Jew? Does the slave go free? We can at least resolve the last question: Noahide is considered an idolater for this. Some say that a non-observant Jew is the same as an idolater, and others say that he is not.
<br />
<br />
Consider a man from Babylon who marries a woman from Israel, and she comes to live with him, together with her slaves. Do we say that she brought slaves outside of Israel and must be penalized by freeing them, or do we say that now they are the husband's, and he should not free them? Here we get no answer.<br />

Gittin 45 - Ransoming hostages - how much to pay?

Is the intent not to impoverish society, or is it to discourage future hostage-taking? A certain Levi bar Darga redeemed his daughter for twelve thousand gold coins. Since he paid the money himself, society was not burdened. Does it not prove that the second reason - that the bandits should not take more Jews hostage in the future - does not apply? Said Abaye, "Who said that the Sages approved of his actions?" - Rather, this rule is intended to discourage future hostage-taking.
<br />
<br />
Another rule: not to help hostages escape but rather continue with the ransom negotiations. What is the reason here? Some say it is to prevent harsher treatment of future hostages, while others say it is to avoid the torture of the remaining ones. Why does the reason matter if the rule is not to help them  escape? - It will make a difference in the case of a single captive: the first reason would still apply, but the second would not.
<br />
<br />
Likewise, the Torah scroll, tefillin, and mezuzah can only be bought from idolaters for reasonable amounts to benefit society. If one does not buy them, the sellers may destroy them in anger, but if he buys them for too much - they may continue stealing.
<br />
<br />
However, a question may be asked: perhaps they wrote the Torah, and if so, how can it be read in the synagogue? Rabbi Eliezer would say that anything an idolater does is for the sake of his idol - so this Torah scroll should be destroyed. Rav Hamnuna said that Torah scrolls written by non-Jews or anyone who is not proper to write them, such as a non-observant Jew, are invalid and should be buried. Our rule works according to the opinion that if the Torah is written correctly, anyone can write it - if only the leather was prepared for the sake of writing a Torah scroll on it.<br />

Gittin 46 - Divorce that cannot be undone

Why? Should he later find out that she was maligned, he could say, "Had I only known this, I would have never divorced you - even if they paid me a lot of money!" Such words can make her Get invalid. Then she would still be considered married to him, and her children from the next husband would get the status of mamzerim. With the new rule, however, he understands that this divorce is final, and even if the accusations are false, he will not be able to return her. Thus, his actions show that he no longer loves her, and his claim, "Had I only known," is not to be believed.
<br />
<br />
If one divorces his wife because she is incapable of childbearing - and states so - he cannot remarry her. If she marries again and has children, he could claim, "Had I only known that you can have children, I would have never divorced you." This could invalidate her divorce and the legitimacy of his children.<div>&nbsp;
<br />Since this divorce is her fault, as it stands, she does not get the Ketubah payment. However, if she now marries, has children, and then asks for the Ketubah payment (claiming wrongful divorce), the husband can counterclaim and say, "Your silence is better than your words." That is, if you keep silent - well and good, but if you demand the Ketubah, I can say this, "Had I known that in the end, after my divorce, I will also have to pay the Ketubah, I would have never divorced you" - which leads to the same consequences.

If one sells himself and his children as slaves to idolaters, the community should redeem him. However, if he keeps doing this repeatedly, they refrain. After the father's death, the community should redeem his children. While the father was alive, he watched over them, but now they should not be taught the wrong way of life.
<br />
<br />
There was a village near the city of Lod whose residents were occasional cannibals. A man sold himself to them and asked Rabbi Ami to command the community to redeem him. Rabbi Ami quoted the above rule and said that it should apply, especially here, where the man's life was in danger. They told Rabbi Ami, “He eats forbidden foods!” He answered, “Maybe there was nothing else?” They told him, “No, he did it on purpose.” Rabbi Ami said to the man, “Sorry, they don't let me redeem you.”
<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish heard of this and sold himself to the people near Lod. As a last wish, he asked to be permitted to sit them down, tie them, and give them a light blow with his backpack.  Inside the backpack was a stone, and in this way, he killed them.
<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish worked hard but spent his earnings liberally and kindheartedly. All he left as inheritance was a quart of safflower oil, but he was still upset, quoting, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2649.htm">They left their possessions to strangers</a>." A man should not amass wealth and pass it to his descendants since they may be unworthy.
<br />
<br />
When a non-Jew buys land in Israel, does he own it ritually so that even tithes need not be given? Some say no, because “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=25#P3490">I (God) own the land</a>.“ Others say yes, because it says, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=14#P5308">Take tithe of your grain</a>” (and not of grain owned by a non-Jew). Either way, the Sages established that the seller should keep buying the first fruit from this land and bringing it to the Temple. This was done to discourage such sales.

Gittin 48 – When to give the best land

Rabbi Yochanan says that the land is regarded as sold with the trees, and Rabbi Asi comments that he better say this, or else "Rabbi Yochanan will not find his hands and feet in the study hall." 
<br />
<br />
Why is this? Because in another place, the same Rabbi Yochanan said that brothers who inherit land from their father are considered buyers of land from each other. In those times when the Jubilee year was observed, the land would return to the owners every fifty years. Unless the land went with the fruit, nobody would ever own land in the true sense of the word, and nobody would ever bring the first fruit!
<br />
<br />
Continuing with the laws promulgated "for the benefit of the world," the next one is this: if one harms his neighbor, he pays for it "with the best of his land." We are talking about material damages here, and if the tortfeasor (let's call him "damager") has cash, he should simply pay cash. However, if he does not, he may have land, and the courts collect from his land. The amount they collect is equal to the damage. But the quality of the land is up to the court, and the rule is "take the best."
<br />
<br />
But why is it called a "decree of the Sages?" Is it&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=22#P2116">Torah law that everyone already knows</a>?! &nbsp;– Actually, yes. However, it would be only according to Rabbi Ishmael, who understands the "best field "differently. The best field, but of whom? – Of the damaged party! A rich damager would just give some bad land because it would be like the best of the poor damaged party. The Sages prevented this by requiring that the damager gives of his best.

Gittin 49 – Why does land quality matter?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

However, we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/02/gittin-48-when-to-give-best-land.html">started discussing</a> that it is not clear what "his field" means. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ishmael says, "His field was damaged, and his field is now used to measure the quality." That is, the damaged party's best field determines the quality of the land to be collected. Rabbi Akiva says the phrase "He must pay with the best of his field," clearly tells that the one who pays is the one whose field we are discussing. 
<br />
<br />
But why all this talk about the best land, medium or bad one? Rabbi Shimon, the only one who explained the reasons behind Torah laws, said: why does the damager pay from his best land? – So that people would think thus: "What's the point of robbing or stealing? Tomorrow the courts will take it all away from me, and they will do it by taking my best land!"
<br />
<br />
Now, why is a debt repaid with medium-quality land? So that a rich person would not think thus: "I will advance a loan to this fellow of mine, and then when he cannot repay, I will collect his best vineyard!" But according to this logic, he should collect the worst land!? – If you do this, will people refrain from giving loans altogether?
<br />
<br />
Finally, the Ketubah of a woman (after all, we are studying divorces) is paid from the worst land of the husband; why is that? – Because the various advantages a woman derives from marriage are significant, women will not refrain from getting married just because they know that their Ketubah payment will be paid from bad-quality land.
<br />

Gittin 50 – Credit obligations
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

When someone guarantees the payment of the Ketubah, he incurs no obligation. If the husband later defaults and does not pay the Ketubah to his wife, our guarantor is off the hook. Why is that? The guarantor relies primarily on the husband to pay the Ketubah and reasons that he will most likely never have to pay. Moreover, he is simply doing a mitzvah to encourage the pair to marry! That is why we can assume that he does not seriously obligate himself. 
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/02/gittin-49-why-does-land-quality-matter.html">We mentioned earlier</a>&nbsp;that a debt if one cannot pay it, is collected from his lands of medium quality. Why is that? In truth, he could even give his worst land. The Torah said the lender "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=24#P5530">Cannot come into the house to take a deposit, but must wait outside till the debtor brings him something</a>." What will the debtor bring? – Of course, the worst. However, the Sages raised the borrower's obligations, for otherwise, nobody would want to loan money to his fellow.
<br />
<br />
However, when a man dies and a creditor comes to collect the debt, he can only collect from the worst. This is so because he collects not from the borrower but from the orphans that are left. If they are minors, they surely need protection, and even if they are adults, they likely have not paid attention to their father's loans and can be easily fooled. Here the Sages left the Torah law intact because lenders seldom consider the possibility of the borrower's death and would give out loans anyway.

Gittin 51 – Limit people's desires
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiLAiWMEZHiYuEjchYHuknHXgfCg-GcJTYoUgb3k1Hewo180-Tttr-LpzatlN9Ui4pDFA9an79QwmjSB6RczolgoSTYsVTCeb7l0wFZCAS1isd3Y4Bxl4l_eLz-fmrKAUDLz4XsSYS-M64/s1600/Harvest+in+Provence+by+Vincent+Van+Gogh.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="252" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiLAiWMEZHiYuEjchYHuknHXgfCg-GcJTYoUgb3k1Hewo180-Tttr-LpzatlN9Ui4pDFA9an79QwmjSB6RczolgoSTYsVTCeb7l0wFZCAS1isd3Y4Bxl4l_eLz-fmrKAUDLz4XsSYS-M64/s320/Harvest+in+Provence+by+Vincent+Van+Gogh.jpg" width="320" /></a>Imagine that someone (Shimon) bought land, worked it, had crops coming, and now it is discovered that the land was stolen. The one from whom the land was originally stolen comes and reclaims the land and the crop, and Shimon is left with nothing. So he goes to the land seller (who is, as it turned out, a thief) and wants to collect his money from the seller. But the seller has no cash, and his fields have also been sold. Shimon then goes and collects from the purchasers of the thief's land. By right, he should be able to collect the price of the field and the crops.
<br />
<br />
However, the Sages limited his collection rights for the world's benefit. If someone could always come and collect not only a field but also unexpected and unlimited crops, people would be so nervous about buying fields that commerce would stop. 
<br />
<br />
An oath is serious, and there is only one money-related oath in the Torah. It happens when someone in court admits to a part of the claim. Say the lender claims that someone owes him 200 coins,  and the borrower admits that yes, indeed, he owes money, but only 100 coins. In that case, the Torah says the court can require an oath from the borrower. Why is that? The borrower can rationalize and say, "I will return the money later, so now, to avoid being a bad guy, I will just say that I only owe a part." With the oath, he won't say it. 
<br />
<br />
By right, the same oath applies if someone returns a wallet with 100 coins, and the owner claims that there were 200. However, the Sages canceled the oath, or people would never return lost objects.

The owner of the house they live in may take it on himself, or the father may appoint him or her. This administrator has rules of what he can and cannot do. He is required to take tithes on their foods. Once they grow up and can care for themselves, the administrator must declare under oath that he did not misappropriate anything of theirs.
<br />
<br />
How can he take the tithe when the produce does not belong to him, if the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4283"><b>You</b> will tithe <b>your</b> grain</a>" – and not someone else? – Indeed, he is only allowed to tithe what is needed for food, but anything that is stored for later – they will tithe when they grow up.<br />
<br />
There was an administrator in the neighborhood of Rabbi Meir, who was trying to sell the land of the orphans, but the rule is that administrators should not impoverish the orphans – so Rabbi Meir was not letting him. Rabbi Meir was then told in his dream, "I (God) am trying to destroy them, and you are trying to save?!" – But Rabbi Meir still did not allow it because "one does not take actions based on dreams."
<br />
<br />
The administrator takes an oath that he did not steal – Sages decreed this to protect the orphans. Since the administrator is most likely returning a favor, he will not refrain from being an administrator just because he will have to swear. Abba Shaul gives the opposite reason: administrator is just being nice, and if you put an oath on him, he will eschew the obligation; if a court appoints him – then he gets the benefit of people trusting him and, therefore, will not refuse – and the logic of Abba Shaul was accepted.

Gittin 53 – Invisible damage

Likewise, he may cause loss by adding the Kohen's portion to his fellow's wine – so that now only Kohanim can drink it. Finally, he can pour this wine as a libation for the idols. 
<br />
<br />
The three cases are all similar in that the damage is not perceptible. In this case, does the perpetrator have to pay? – The answer is that if he did it by mistake, he is free, but if he did not on purpose, then he is liable. Why such a distinction? 
<br />
<br />
In truth, he did real damage and should be liable in both cases. However, the Sages decreed, for the benefit of society, that one who does it by mistake is not penalized. This will encourage him to tell of his deed to the owner, and the owner will not transgress by using this wine. However, if he did it on purpose, there is no point in encouraging him to confess – he will not tell in any case.
<br />
<br />
Others say that just the opposite, invisible damage is not real, and one is not liable in either case. Now, why is the one who does it on purpose still have to pay? – The Sages decreed so, for otherwise, everyone can damage his fellow's property by these actions that leave no visible trace.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud discusses why each case had to be mentioned specifically and how it cannot be derived from the other two.

Gittin 54 – To punish or not to punish
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifhZCcZmfiYqQ0B88ufcUoP7YvAMZFvgwPYAFxp9uUFTeMn9ZS6pBIRz0lt4nuKChlQca-JyR-njARrsA6DTNA7mB_sIpti5aRXVewMDQoqUqqJZDqwYeYa79rSRqkju0ip_7HtcF6fiic/s1600/Rabbi+by+Rembrandt+Van+Rijn.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifhZCcZmfiYqQ0B88ufcUoP7YvAMZFvgwPYAFxp9uUFTeMn9ZS6pBIRz0lt4nuKChlQca-JyR-njARrsA6DTNA7mB_sIpti5aRXVewMDQoqUqqJZDqwYeYa79rSRqkju0ip_7HtcF6fiic/s320/Rabbi+by+Rembrandt+Van+Rijn.jpg" width="293" /></a></div>
Earlier, we saw that the Sages <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/02/gittin-53-invisible-damage.html">sometimes added and at other times removed penalties</a>. However, the logic depended on a particular situation. For example, if one plants a tree on Shabbat, then if he did it on purpose, he should uproot this tree, but if he did it by mistake, he can keep it. Compare this to planting on a Shmita year, when planting in Israel is generally forbidden: whether he does it on purpose or by mistake if he plants a tree on Shmita,<br />
he has to uproot it. 
<br />
<br />
Why the difference? – Jews were not suspected of violating Shabbat, so he who did it was probably a brazen violator who would not try to claim that he did it by mistake. Thus, there was no reason to penalize those who did it by mistake. Shmita was different: too many people regarded it lightly and violated it and would then claim that they did it by mistake; therefore, the Sages decreed that even he who plants a tree on Shmita by mistake must still uproot it.
<br />
<br />
Continuing with invisible damage, a Kohen who brings a sacrifice can easily ruin it with his thought: if he thinks, while doing the slaughter (shehitah) or while accepting blood, that he plans to eat it at the wrong time, the sacrifice is immediately invalid. This is similar to the cases discussed just above, and the rule is that if he did it on purpose, he is liable to repay the cost of the sacrifice. The Talmud then discusses why we believe the Kohen, who says that he ruined the sacrifice.

Rabbi Yochanan ben Gudgeda testified there about some laws that he remembered. Some of them dealt with the benefit of society.
<br />
<br />
For example, a deaf-mute girl, whom her father gave in marriage, can be divorced with a Get – even though she is not legally competent to accept it. This is true because a woman could be divorced against her will (until the Sages decreed otherwise).
<br />
<br />
Rava derived from here that if a man prepares a Get, tells a witness in secret that he is going to divorce his wife - but then tells his wife that it is a loan document that he wants her to accept – she is nevertheless divorced. But this is obvious!? – Rava had to tell this us because otherwise, we could think that the man annuls the Get by calling it a “loan document” – so Rava tells us that he is doing this out of embarrassment. 
<br />
<br />
Another enactment: if someone stole a beam and made it part of his house, then by right, he should disassemble the house and return the beam. Yet the Sages decreed that he could just return the cost. Why did they do it? – To make it easier for those who want to repent of their previous theft.

<br />
<br />
At the time of destruction, the Roman law was that anyone who could kill a Jew should do so – or else he would be killed. Later, he was fined four zuz. Yet later, he would be killed. During the first of these periods, there were no oppressors in Israel – they were completely free to rob Jewish land, and there was no law for them. When law and order were restored, if a Jew wanted to buy land his land back from an oppressor, he had the first right to do so. If someone else wanted to redeem this land, he had to pay a quarter to the original owner and then redeem it from the oppressor.
<br />
<br />
But how did the destruction happen? One rich person in Jerusalem was having a feast, and he invited his friend, Kamtza. By mistake, the servant invited his worst enemy, Bar Kamtza. Bar Kamtza came but was requested to leave. He pleaded to stay and offered to pay, even for the whole feast – to preserve his dignity – but it did not help. He figured out that they were all to blame since the Sages were there and nobody stood up for him. He then incited the Roman ruler to destroy Jerusalem. 
<br />
<br />
The dispatched general used divination and saw, by bird's flight and by arrow's flight, that Jerusalem would indeed fall. He then asked a child what he was learning, and the child said, "I will take revenge on Edom." The general understood that God wanted to destroy Jerusalem but that he would later take revenge on him, so he ran away, converted, and Rabbi Meir was one of his descendants.  Then came Titus and destroyed the Temple.

The Jews of Har HaMelech used to take out a rooster and a hen for the wedding, implying that the newlywed should have many children, just like the rooster and the hen. Once, a band of Romans saw it and took the rooster away. Jews fell upon and killed them, and Caesar came with his army to take revenge.<br />
<br />
There was one of the Jews from the south who could jump a mile. He was so swift that he alone could kill all of the Roman army. Caesar put his crown on the ground and prayed, "Master of the entire world, do not let me be shamed through a single man." The southerner, however, said differently: "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2660.htm">God, you have forsaken us</a>," implying that he would defeat the Romans alone anyway. That was the cause of his downfall, since a snake bit him when he went into the toilet, and he died. Caesar retreated in gratitude that God answered his prayer. The Jews misunderstood and celebrated their victory. On seeing that, Caesar came back and destroyed Har HaMelech.<br />
<br />
The Talmud describes another place where righteous Jews were killed and asks, why? It answers –  because they did not mourn the destruction of Jerusalem – while <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1066.htm">one should be in joy when Jerusalem is being rebuilt and mourn when it is destroyed</a>.<br />

Gittin 58 – In the aftermath of destruction

<br />
<br />
Jewish boys captured by the Romans were exceedingly beautiful. Initially, Romans used to look at a signet ring with images made of the best gold when engaging in conjugal relations. Now they started using Jewish boys by tyeing them to the beds and looking at them at this time. One of the boys asked another, "Where is this punishment written in the Torah?" The other replied, "Even blows not written in this Torah scroll will God bring on you." The boy accepted the answer but continued, "How far was I from this place in my studies?" - "A column and a half." The boy concluded, "Had I come to this place myself, I would have understood it without you."
<br />
<br />
In these times, many oppressors would seize land from the Jews. If later, when the law became more enforceable, another Jew wanted to repurchase land from the oppressors, this was praiseworthy because more of the Land of Israel would be in Jewish hands. However, he needed to consider that this land previously belonged<br />
 to a fellow Jew and was taken away from him. Therefore, he had to formally acquire it from this Jew first and then redeem it from the oppressor. If he first redeemed it from the oppressor and then from the Jew, it did not count because of the potential intimidation of that Jew by the oppressor.

Young orphans may be hard-pressed to find sustenance. They may try to sell some of their land. But since all know that these children are not legally adults and that when they grow up, they may retract and demand their fields back, people may be unwilling to buy orphans' fields. Therefore the Sages changed the law here and allowed such sales to stand, even when the orphans grow up. At what age do young children acquire this right? -- Between six and ten, depending on their maturity.<br />
<br />
Seven people are called to read the Torah in the synagogue on Shabbat, and the first one should be the most learned. This law, however ancient and just, could lead to quarrels, and a new rule was adopted: the first one to read is a Kohen, and following him is a Levi. Afterward, regular "Israel" Jews are called. In this way, people don't argue, and peace prevails.<br />
<br />
A similar law was established for peace in society: if fish is caught in one's net, technically, it does not belong to the net owner because – if he does not hold the net – he has not acquired it in any of the accepted ways. Nevertheless, the Sages gave him ownership, and now anyone else who takes the fish from the net is considered to be stealing it. Another law: gleanings in the field in Israel are left for the Jewish poor. Yet the Sages accepted the rule that any poor who comes to collect them is permitted to do so – to prevent strife.

Gittin 60 – “I say, I have come, it was written about me in the Torah scroll”
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhakMdmtbm0QeHialWm85dKxTDGAga0eKHwE_d2s-VxM8b03SMICiTRUvU2QJDSybmfJkJSF4xLi5GPYXbF97qL6qq4fq-JIVu8VbIK86lubT_PFYkpwo2wy8llw51Js8QC6bQxMkD6tiez/s1600/King+David+by+Juan+Correa+de+Vivar.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhakMdmtbm0QeHialWm85dKxTDGAga0eKHwE_d2s-VxM8b03SMICiTRUvU2QJDSybmfJkJSF4xLi5GPYXbF97qL6qq4fq-JIVu8VbIK86lubT_PFYkpwo2wy8llw51Js8QC6bQxMkD6tiez/s320/King+David+by+Juan+Correa+de+Vivar.jpg" width="143" /></a>Some say that the Torah was written and given to Jews scroll by scroll and later glued together. The proof comes from the words of David, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2640.htm">I say, I have come, it was written about me in the Torah scroll</a>." What does David mean? 
<br />
<br />
Initially, David doubted whether he could be a king since he was a descendant of Ruth, a Moabite, and the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5498">Moav should not enter the Jewish people</a>." The loophole was that "Moav" was male, so females of Moav, such as Ruth, could enter – but not everyone agreed to it. However, later he found a hint in the angel's words, who says to Lot, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=19#P473">Take the daughters found with you</a>." About David himself, God says, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2689.htm">I have found David, my servant</a>." So David found a hint to himself in the Torah. But since he calls it a "scroll," it means that it was written and given to Jews scroll by scroll.
<br />
<br />
Others say it was written as a whole since God tells Moses, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=31#P5749">Take this book of the Torah</a>." What about the "scroll" proof? – The whole Torah is also called a scroll. But what about "this book" evidence? – That is after it was glued together.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, even though the Torah was written down, a larger body of knowledge was only taught from teacher to student and never written down. What is the proof? "Write for yourself these words" means that some words are to be written down, but "Based on these words" alludes to portions to be guarded and transmitted orally. Later on, it was too hard for the people to remember everything, and even oral teaching was written down – and this is the Talmud.
<br />

One should never be too assertive with the members of his household; if he is, they will lie to him out of fear and lead him to multiple sins. For example, Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel used to put fear into his servants, and they fed him a prohibited thing. What happened? A part of a properly slaughtered animal was lost, and they substituted it with another cut from a live animal. 
<br />
<br />
But is it possible that a righteous Rabbi Chanina would eat anything not kosher? God watches even over the animals of the righteous, like in the story where a donkey would not eat food from which tithe was not separated; how much more so over the righteous themselves? – True, they wanted to feed him a prohibited item, but something prevented this.
<br />
<br />
Mar Ukva sent a question to Rabbi Elazar, "There are bad people who hurt me, and I can give them away to the government, should I?" Rabbi Elazar took out a piece of parchment, made lines for writing, and wrote, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2639.htm">Let me not do wrong with my mouth with an evil person is in front of me</a>." Mar Ukva replied, "But they are torturing me!" Rabbi Elazar then wrote, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2637.htm">Be silent unto God, and the enemies will disappear.</a>" Rabbi Elazar's words took effect right away, and the enemies of Mar Ukva were led away in chains.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then discusses why, according to Mar Ukva, a meal can be accompanied by joyous music only if it is a meal connected to a mitzvah, as well as other signs of diminished joy, decreed after the destruction of the Temple.

Therefore, if his brother marries a woman and dies, and the wife falls to him in a levirate marriage, he lacks the legal power to divorce.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Old Suitor - Young Girl by Jan Steen</div>

The Talmud also discusses which neighboring cities and areas are still considered the Land of Israel for this purpose and which are not. Would writing a Get on a ship close to Israel be regarded the same as on land? 
<br />
<br />
Finally, is a ship the same as a flower pot? We mean the laws of tithes. Anything that grows on a ship does not directly draw sustenance from the Land of Israel, and anything that grows in a hanging pot does not do this either, so at first glance, they should be the same. But perhaps this is not so: a ship constantly moves and thus cannot be considered connected to the ground, but a stable pot can. Or the opposite is true: the air divides between the pot and the earth, so the pot does not draw sustenance from the earth and is not liable to tithes, but a ship is in the water, which can be considered as a continuation of the water bed, and so maybe it is liable to tithes.

Rabbi Eliezer's learning was supreme, but many Rabbis reunited to disprove his teaching after his death. However, all but one of their rebuttals had potential flaws.<br />
<br />
The indisputable proof came from Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria. He deduced the requirement of complete severance from the term that the Torah used, "Kritut," instead of a possible shorter word, "Karet." According to Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria, this teaches that temporary conditions in the Get are valid but not permanent ones.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Portrait of an Old Man by Rembrandt</div>

But what if the husband makes a condition that she can not marry a particular minor? At present, the minor can not marry, but eventually, he will become an adult. By comparison with a minor girl who can divorce, because eventually she will marry as an adult, the Get above is declared not complete separation, thus void.<br />

In the same way, a Get can be given to a slave, and it will be a letter of his emancipation, reading "You are free" or "You belong to yourself."
<br />
<br />
The similarity goes further: a woman can bring her own Get to court, and they will use it to effect a divorce, as long as she can tell them it was written and signed before her. So too, can do the slave. 
<br />
<br />
However, if in the Get, the master says to the slave, "You and all my possessions are yours," - he indeed goes free because it is similar to a Get of a woman, but the second part, "all my possessions are yours," does not take effect because, for any monetary transaction, one needs two witnesses. There are two clauses in this Get, and they work differently.
<br />
<br />
What happens if the Get says, "You acquire all my possessions." Since "all my possessions" includes the slave, he acquires himself and becomes free, and in the same step, acquires all the possessions as well. At least, this is what Abaye opined. 
<br />
<br />
Rava disagreed. Since the slave did not have two witnesses, he did not acquire the possessions. And since he did not acquire the possessions, he did not acquire himself and is thus still a slave. Rava later changed his mind but still divided the single statement "You acquire all my possessions" into two. This is called severability, but here it is applied to one sentence! They continued to argue about this principle.

<br />
The High Priest is removed from his position if he develops a physical blemish that makes his service invalid. A leader is removed if he develops a sickness of tzaraat – spiritual leprosy – or if he is deposed.<br />
<br />
Who is that leader that the Torah describes as “Prince, or Nasi,” to whom the above laws are applicable? That is the king, as the Torah describes him, “one who has no superior except God.”<br />
<br />
The king is a servant of the people, as we see from the following story. Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua were traveling together on a ship, Rabban Gamliel had bread, and Rabbi Yehoshua had bread and flour. When Rabban Gamliel ran out of bread, he was sustained by Rabbi Yehoshua's flour. Said he to Rabbi Yehoshua, “Why were you so provident?” Rabbi Yehoshua replied that there is a star that misleads sailors, and it shows once in 70 years. “If you are so smart,” - said Rabban Gamliel - “Why do you have to travel on business?” Rabbi Yehoshua replied, “Before you help me, help your two students, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yochanan, who know how to count every drop in the sea, but don't have bread. Rabban Gamliel wanted to appoint them heads of  Yeshiva, but they did not want to. So he told them, “Don't think that I am making you rulers, rather, I am making you servants.”<br />

After the anointing oil was concealed, only the installation by donning the extra vestments remained. <br />
<br />
The difference between an anointed High Priest and one who was installed with additional garments is that only the anointed Priest brings a special bull sacrifice if he sins or the court errs.<br />
<br />
If a High Priest becomes ritually impure or otherwise temporarily unfit for service, another High Priest is appointed in his stead. When the first one returns, he is called The Serving High Priest, and the temporary substitute gets the name of High Priest Who Passed out of Service. The Serving High Priest is higher in that he brings the bull of Yom Kippur and his daily flour offering. They are equally commanded to marry a virgin and cannot marry a widow. Both cannot observe mourning, and accidental murderers return from their exile on the death of both.<br />

On the subject of good omens, if one wants to know if he will live out the year or not, he should kindle a lamp during the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, in a house where no wind blows. If the light continues to burn for as long as there is oil in the lamp, we know that he will live out the year.<br />
<br />
If one wants to undertake a business venture and wants to know if it will be successful or not, let him raise a rooster for the sake of that business venture and let him see: if the rooster grows plump and fine, it is  a good omen that he will be successful.<br />
<br />
If one wants to go out on the road and wants to know if he will return home safely or not, let him stand in a dark house. If he sees a shadow of his shadow, know that he will return home successfully.<br />
<br />
And it is not a wise thing for one to do, for if the omen is negative, he may become distressed, and his luck might indeed take a turn for the worst. For this reason, the omens are formulated to consider only the good outcome.<br />

Horayot 13 – Order of Precedence
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNu50eprKD_t8FbwHVTe-8GxnWFiHk-WSuHUPjYkkVOcumwP3qxKAbZVROlEoLKckfux3aDsEW_MLGFTgTxIJXnzT1xDUI3i0PFHzlLtvi57Q4RL4T6FOqtBVxlZ_KimLxVxS0Jv2-Aw0/s1600/Jean-L%25C3%25A9on+G%25C3%25A9r%25C3%25B4me+-+Old+Clothing+Merchant+in+Cairo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="253" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNu50eprKD_t8FbwHVTe-8GxnWFiHk-WSuHUPjYkkVOcumwP3qxKAbZVROlEoLKckfux3aDsEW_MLGFTgTxIJXnzT1xDUI3i0PFHzlLtvi57Q4RL4T6FOqtBVxlZ_KimLxVxS0Jv2-Aw0/s320/Jean-L%25C3%25A9on+G%25C3%25A9r%25C3%25B4me+-+Old+Clothing+Merchant+in+Cairo.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">When a High Priest needs to observe mourning, he tears his garment from the bottom, and not from the top, like regular priests and laypeople do. He brings sacrifices even on the first day of mourning, just does not eat them, while regular priests do not bring sacrifices.<br />
<br />
When one has any two mitzvot that he can perform, he should first do the one that is more frequent, and this is derived from the order of sacrifices in the Temple. If one mitzvah is more sacred than the other, it has to be done first. If the High Priest's bull and the assembly's bull, brought for a court's error, are both standing to be sacrificed, the High Priest's bull goes first – not based on the above rules, but because it is called “first” by the Torah. <br />
<br />
If a man and a woman both need food or clothing, the woman takes precedence, because the man can go begging door to door. When both are held captive, the woman is ransomed first.<br />

Five things are conducive to retaining one's learning: eating wheat bread, eating lightly cooked eggs, regular consumption of olive oil, regular enjoyment of wine and aromatics spices, and drinking water left over from producing a dough.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel instituted that the Prince (he occupied this position) should be given more honor than the President of Court (Rabbi Nathan) and than the leading Sage (Rabbi Meir). They wanted to overthrow him, and plotted to suddenly ask him to expound Ukzin, the hardest tractate of Mishna. A friend, however, warned him, so he studied all night and was able to expound on the next day. However, Rabban Gamliel forbade Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Nathan to enter the study hall, and they had to write their answers in a piece of paper and throw them inside. The Sages petitioned for them, and they were readmitted, but when their teachings are quoted, they are not mentioned by name, but as "others say."<br />

Whether he ate the blood together with them at a meal, or after observing them, or even if they just ruled it permitted, but did not do it themselves, since he relied on their words, it is not his fault.<br />
<br />
However, if he was one of the Sages of the court, or even one of the students who was worthy to be on the court, and he knew that they erred, but he nevertheless followed their ruling, he is liable to bring a sin offering. If he knew that they erred, then why did he do it? Because he mistakenly thought that the mitzvah to follow the words of the Sages applies even in this case.<br />

However, if the majority of Jews acted on a court's error – who ruled, for example, that a certain action is not idol worship when in reality it is – then each individual is not liable, and instead the court brings the sacrifice for the mistake they had made. The majority in this case is determined only among the Jews living in Israel.<br />
<br />
What if the court mistakenly ruled that a certain prohibited fat (destined for the Altar) is permitted, and then a minority of Israel acted upon that, then the court retracted their mistake, and afterwards again mistakenly ruled that this fat was allowed, and now a different minority acted upon it – do they combine into a majority? This and other similar inquiries remain unresolved.<br />

<br />
What happens if an individual did it  because he has not heard that the court has retracted? Rabbi Shimon always exempts him. Rabbi Elazar says that his error is in doubt, and therefore he must bring a special guilt-offering.  This applies when he stayed at home and could check on the court opinion before doing the act. If he went overseas, he is completely exempt.<br />
<br />
The court needs to forget only part of the law, but not the complete law. For example, if they ruled that there is no Shabbat in the Torah, they are exempt from the bull offering, but if they said, “There is Shabbat in the Torah, but one is allowed to carry things from one's house into the street,” - then they are liable to a communal-error bull offering.<br />

If the court ruled incorrectly on purpose, and not by mistake, then each individual who transgressed brings his own sin offering, an ewe or a she-goat.<br />
<br />
How many bulls are brought? There are multiple opinions about it: some say that the court brings the offering, and some – that the congregation of people does it. Furthermore, each tribe is called a congregation, so there are opinions that each tribe brings an offering, some tribes bring it, and even that all tribes bring it if one tribe sinned. Some opinions require the court of a single tribe to bring an offering, but the Sages say that liability exists only for the error of the Great Sanhedrin of seventy one, which was located on the Temple Mount, in the Chamber of Hewn Stones.<br />

<br />
Incidentally, they were not all “burnt offerings,” rather, the goats were sin-offerings. If so, why are they called this? - because the goats were sin-offerings for idol worship, but like the burnt offering, they were not eaten by the priest.<br />
<br />
According to Rabbi Yehudah, who says that if some of the tribes sinned, every tribe brings a goat, we understand twelve goats. According to Rabbi Shimon, who says that tribes do not “drag” each other into asking for forgiveness, eleven tribes sinned and brought eleven offerings, and the twelfth was brought by the court. But according to Rabbi Meir, who says that only the court brings the offering, why were twelve offerings required? Rabbi Meir answers that the court sinned, changed its mind, sinned again, changed its mind again, and so on, twelve times. <br />
<br />
If, after the mistake of the court, one of the Jews dies, they still bring an offering – since the congregation never dies – but if one of the judges dies, they do not bring an offering.<br />

His law is thus similar to the court's ruling that it makes for the community.<br />
<br />
If he ruled incorrectly together with the court and performed the act together with the congregation, he does not bring his special sacrifice but is atoned for by the communal “sacrifice of forgetfulness” bull. Just as the court is only liable if it negates a part of a commandment, but not the whole commandment, so too the High Priest.<br />

This is known by comparison to the law of one's wife's sister, which the Torah spells out. In both places the same word “because of her” is used and thus their laws are the same. This rule is also true for an anointed priest, about whom the Torah says “for the people to be ashamed of him” - which means that he has the same law as the people. This rule is also true for a leader of the nation.<br />
<br />
The court does not bring a bull sacrifice if they rule incorrectly about a purity aspect of the Temple service, since an individual brings a different sin offering for that. Rather, it should be an error leading to a regular sin-offering, for example, the positive commandment of husband and wife to abstain before the day of expected menses, and a negative commandment not to have relations with the wife who has not been to the mikvah.<br />

<br />
If the transgression was that of idol worship, an individual, the leader, and the anointed priest bring a she-goat, whereas the court brings a bull and a he-goat. The bull as completely burned on the Altar, and the goat is a sin-offering, which is partially eaten by the priests.<br />

If one violated a commandment, resulting in a guilt-offering, and furthermore if he is in doubt about this,  both an and a leader of the community bring a “doubtful guilt-offering,” but the anointed priest and the court are exempt.

For example, if a litigant in money matters asked a witness to testify, and the witness refused, the litigant then asked him to swear that he knows nothing, and he swore (falsely), the witness needs to bring a sacrifice. This variable cost sacrifice is an animal in the case of sufficient means, a bird offering if he is poor, and a flour offering, if he is indigent. 
<br />
<br />
The same type of sacrifice is brought by one who inadvertently entered the Temple while being spritually impure, or one who ate the meat of sacrifices in this state.
<br />
<br />
A woman who gave birth brings a male lamb if she has the means, and a pair of birds if she is poor. A spiritual leper (metzora) brings three animals (sin, guilt, and burned offerings) if he has the means, and one animal and two birds if he is poor.

For example, for mistaken relations with all other women one brings a sin-offering, but for a slavewoman he brings a guilt-offering. Incidentally, sin-offering is always a female sheep, and guilt-offering is a male ram. 
<br />
<br />
Usually, both transgressing parties have equal liability, for example, both bring a sacrifice. In the case of relations with a slavewoman, the man is liable for a sacrifice, whether he acted intentionally or by mistake; she, on the other hand, is only liable if she was warned not to do it and nevertheless immediately proceeded with the act, in which case she is liable to lashes. Usually, one is liable for each and every act of cohabitation, but with the slavewoman he brings one sacrifice for all acts. Normally, one is liable whether he performs the “beginning of cohabitation” (genital contact, and some say, insertion of the corona), or the “complete act” (full penetration), but in the case of a slavewoman one is only liable for the complete act. Normally, if one of the partners was sleeping, only the awake one is liable, but in the case of a slavewoman, if one of the partners was sleeping, none is liable.

Keritot 12 – Witnesses Tell Him That He Inadvertently Ate Forbidden Fat
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB4pB9SwypTLuHA-xV6G580Zx39EkICaPd4fvfdHDek9CBAGD5BH5WJj4PA96HjDaClZ5__2GlkXF0jSEVR6DodAz_kEyIzPoC-evN4yhOY0HMwskJVy1H-pIhMt8v651mFgoLUa0otHo2/s1600/By+Hermann+Kern+-+The+Peasant's+Meal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB4pB9SwypTLuHA-xV6G580Zx39EkICaPd4fvfdHDek9CBAGD5BH5WJj4PA96HjDaClZ5__2GlkXF0jSEVR6DodAz_kEyIzPoC-evN4yhOY0HMwskJVy1H-pIhMt8v651mFgoLUa0otHo2/s320/By+Hermann+Kern+-+The+Peasant's+Meal.jpg" width="209" /></a>If one witness tells somebody, “You ate forbidden fat,” and the man remains silent, he has to bring a sin-offering. However, if he denies it, he is not liable. If two witnesses tell a man that he ate forbidden fat, and he denies it, then Rabbi Meir holds him liable, but the Sages exempt him.
<br />
<br />
(There are two sorts of animal fat, permitted, called “shuman,” and forbidden, called “chelev”. If one eats forbidden fat by mistake, he needs to bring a sin-offering, and if he eats it knowingly, he is liable to be cut off from his spiritual source.)
<br />
<br />
What is the source for these laws and what is the logic of the argument? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=4#P2816">If his sin becomes known to him</a>.” This means that he himself became aware of his act. Alternatively, others told him, but he was silent, thus confirming that he accepted the fact and became aware of it. Thus, if he denies one witness, he is believed.
<br />
<br />
When two witnesses tell him that he ate the wrong fat, we have an established fact. Rabbi Meir then reasons that if witnesses can testify about a capital crime and have a man executed, then certainly they can obligate him to bring a sacrifice. The Sages, however, say that he has a way out: he can claim that he ate the fat on purpose, and be free from a sacrifice obligation. This claim, of course, does not work to escape capital punishment.

Keritot 13 – How Fast One Must Eat

Thus, if he ate half an olive volume of a prohibited substance, and then another half, but took longer than a certain time period, he is not liable. How slow is slow?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that we estimate how long it would take a person to eat the food if it had be crumbled into pieces as small as parched grain, and then eaten one by one. However, the Sages say that this time is measured by how long it would take a person to eat half a loaf of bread, four egg-volumes, and some say, three egg-volumes. The bread for measurement is made of wheat, which is eaten faster than barley, and in practice this time limit is between three to nine minutes. There is also an opinion that one can eat  as slow as he wants, as long as he does not pause for the time it takes a normal person to eat half a loaf.
<br />
<br />
Consequently, if a Kohen drank a quarter of a “log” of wine (about 30 milliliters), during the time that it takes to eat a half a loaf of bread, he is forbidden to enter the Temple to perform service. After the Torah prohibits Kohanim from serving in the Temple while drunk, it continues to say that he needs to “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=10#P2984">Distinguish between the sacred and profaned, permitted and forbidden, and teach the sons of Israel</a>.” By extension, one is not a allowed to render decisions on the matter of law while drunk. However, one is allowed to teach the Talmud.

Keritot 14 – One Meal, Five Transgressions

Rabbi Meir says that if it was Shabbat and he carried food in this mouth, he is liable for a fifth sin-offering, but the Sages respond that it doesn't come it, since it is a different group of prohibitions.
<br />
<br />
What is the count? He (1) ate sacrificial meat in the state of ritual impurity, (2) ate prohibited fat, (3) ate leftover sacrifices, (4) ate on Yom Kippur. Additionally, since the fat was from a consecrated animal, he used consecrated property and needs to bring a guilt-offering.
<br />
<br />
One can do a single act of cohabitation and be liable for six sin-offerings: if he cohabits with his daughter, who is his sister, his brother's wife, his father's brother's wife, a married woman, and was not in a mikva. How is that possible? He had an incestuous relationship with his mother, from which a daughter was born. The daughter married his (paternal) brother. After her husband died, this daughter married his father's brother. He then had committed incest with her, without her going to the mikva.

Keritot 15 – Questions That Rabbi Akiva Asked

Rabbi Akiva met them there and involved them in a discussion. He asked, “If a man inadvertently cohabits with his sister, who is also his father's sister and his mother's sister, what is the law? Does he have to bring only one sacrifice, since it is only one woman, or does he have to bring three, since these are three different prohibitions?” They answers, “We have not heard an explicit decision on this, but we know a similar case. If one cohabits with his five wives who all did not go to a mikva, he needs to bring five sin-offerings. It seems to us that your case can be deduced with a fortiori logic.”
<br />
<br />
What was the question of Rabbi Akiva, if we just learned cases where one brings mutiple offerings? – His case is special, because all prohibitions are in the same group of a “sister.” And the logic of the Sages, it too can be refuted – in their cases there are different women, and Rabbi Akiva asked about one!? Rather, there is a phrase in the Torah that teaches this law: “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=20#P3333">The nakedness of his sister he has uncovered</a>” – these are extra words, which teach that one is liable for each sister-related prohibition.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva then asked them about an animal whose limb was almost severed from its body, whether it conveys ritual impurity, and they answered that they heard a similar case related to humans, and suggested that his question can be answered from there.<br />

Keritot 16 – More Questions That Rabbi Akiva Asked

<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua answered that he heard a similar law: “If one eats from one offering in five different dishes, he brings five sacrifices for misappropriation of Temple property,” and that in Rabbi Akiva's case, which is even worse, since it is five different animals, he for sure needs five sacrifices to atone. However, Rabbi Akiva replied, “If your teachers taught you this, I will accept, because they may have had their reasons, but if it your own logic, I will refute it: in your case, he is receiving pleasure from eating, and that's why he has to bring a sin-offering for each mistake, but in my case he does not receive any pleasure, and perhaps one sacrifice will atone for all.”
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva also reported that he asked Rabbi Eliezer the following question: “If one performs many acts of work on many Sabbaths, but the were all of the same type, what is the law?” Rabbi Eliezer compared his case to multiple copulations with a woman who has not been to the mikva, where one brings a separate sacrifice for each act, but Rabbi Akiva refuted this, since in this case both he and she are liable. Rabbi Eliezer then compared it to cohabitation with a minor, where only he, not she, is liable, but Rabbi Akiva refuted it, by pointing out that eventually even the minor will be liable, when she grows up. Rabbi Eliezer then compared the case to copulations with an animal, and Rabbi Akiva accepted his proof.

Keritot 17 – The Offering Of Uncertainty
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLuDKd0jCyEpnyDg3T1ghqSWugdcP6nuKW3UhQJEM1K7KbVsJnV4pNeLnn_Hdf9hdVhY1BMqE-wBN3FCYEjLnux8qrL2Vy2ZUhg38z99AIyb1_vj6_AgP_VE2muCFLQXey9aFPrhRrrbKS/s1600/Francis+Hayman+-+George+Rogers+with+his+Wife+Margaret+and+his+Sister+Margaret+Rogers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLuDKd0jCyEpnyDg3T1ghqSWugdcP6nuKW3UhQJEM1K7KbVsJnV4pNeLnn_Hdf9hdVhY1BMqE-wBN3FCYEjLnux8qrL2Vy2ZUhg38z99AIyb1_vj6_AgP_VE2muCFLQXey9aFPrhRrrbKS/s320/Francis+Hayman+-+George+Rogers+with+his+Wife+Margaret+and+his+Sister+Margaret+Rogers.jpg" width="305" /></a>An offering of uncertainty arises in the cases where one is not sure if he transgressed or not. It suspends his judgment until he is able to clarify the situation, and then he either brings a sin offering or nothing at all.<br />
<br />
For example, if one had in front of him two pieces of fat, and he thought that he was eating permitted fat, “shuman”, but later became aware that it might have been forbidden fat, “chelev.” Another possibility: his wife and his sister were with him in the house, and he cohabited with one of them, thinking, of course, that it was his wife, and later it transpired that it might have been his sister. Yet another case: Sabbath or weekday. He did labor at the end of Sabbath thinking that it was already weekday, but later found out that it may have been Sabbath. In all these cases one brings the offering of uncertainty.
<br />
<br />
In the ruling there always were two choices. Rav Assi, however, said that even if he ate one piece of meat, but it could have been permitted or prohibited, he brings a sacrifice. What is the reason of Rav Assi? – The Torah has written “Mitzvat” - a mitzva, so it applies even in the case of one, and the written word of the Torah is paramount. Chiya bar Rav said that there has to be a choice between two alternative, since this word is read “Miztvot”, in plural, and pronunciation is more important than the spelling.

An offering of uncertainty is brought when one suspect that he has committed an act which makes him liable to be cut off from his spiritual source. They reported about Bava ben Buta that he wanted to bring an offering of uncertainty every day – except after Yom Kippur, where his chances of accidental transgression were too small. Bava ben Buta himself said, “By the Temple! I would bring an offering of uncertainty even after Yom Kuppur, but the Sages tell me to wait until I come into a genuine situation of doubt.” Nevertheless, Rabbi Eliezer does allow one to bring an offering of uncertainty every day.
<br />
<br />
When is this relevant? Consider the following situation. If there were two pieces of fat, and a Jew came along and ate the first one, and then an idolater came and ate the second one, the Jew is liable to an offering of uncertainty. If two Jews each ate a piece, then they tell to the second, “Please bring an offering of uncertainty, for otherwise your fellow will have to bring a sin-offering.” Who could have authored this rule? Only Rabbi Eliezer, who allows a voluntary offering of uncertainty.

Imagine that one had in front of him two pieces of fat, one prohibited as “chelev,” which is usually brought on the Altar, and the other one a leftover from a sacrifice, and he ate one, but does not know which one. Does he need to know which of the two specific mistakes he&nbsp;committed, if both obligate him in a sin-offering? A similar situation: his wife and his sister were with him in a house, but unlike <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/keritot-17-offering-of-uncertainty.html">the previous case</a>, his wife has not been to the mikva, which makes her prohibited to him under the penalty of being cut off, and he had relations with one of them, thinking that it was permitted, but does not know which. Yet a third case: Yom Kippur was adjacent to Shabbat, and he did some prohibited work at the close of the day, so he does not know if he transgressed Yom Kuppur or Shabbat, for both of which he deserves to be cut off.
<br />
<br />
In all three cases Rabbi Eliezer holds him liable for a sin-offering, since he for sure transgressed, while Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him, since he does not know the exact nature of his transgression. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose corrects the third case: it could be that he performed half of the labor on Shabbat and the other half on Yom Kippur, in which case he would not be liable. Rather, he did the work in the middle of the day,  but does not know which day it was, and it is here that the argument applies.<br />

These include relations with one's mother, one's father's wife even if she is not his mother, one's sister, and one's daughter-in-law. They also include cohabiting with animals, with a woman who did not go to a mikva, eating bread on Passover, and violating Shabbat. As a rule, if one does it by mistake, he needs to bring a sin-offering, but if he does them on purpose, then he may be cut off.
<br />
<br />
Exactly what being cut off means depends on the person, on his action, and on his other deeds. He may die early or see his children die, or he may live to an old age, but loose connection with the Creator, in this world and perhaps even in the next.
<br />
<br />
Any time that a rule mentions the number of cases, it means to teach us something extra, since we could count ourselves. In the case of thirty-six acts above, it wants to tell us that if he did many different acts while forgetting that they are forbidden, he needs to bring a sacrifice for each one.

It is certainly forbidden to consume blood, but “lifeblood” carries with it the penalty of being cut off from the spiritual source, while regular blood is prohibited by a negative commandment. In addition, “blood” of some creatures is permitted. What are the exact circumstances?
<br />
<br />
If one consumed blood which came as a result of slaughter, whether of kosher domesticated or non-domesticated animals, fowl, or non-kosher animals, this is lifeblood. So too if he tore the animal's pipes, or did bloodletting in which the soul departs. Blood of the spleen, blood of the heart – although these organs are full of blood, and so too the blood that drains gently after the animal is slaughtered – one is not liable to be cut off for these, although it is prohibited. Thus only blood of animals and fowl is prohibited, but not blood of grasshoppers, or of fish.

Keritot 21 – Why Is Consuming Blood Prohibited
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVJust9bRZg0dX67VhbCxjkhAbMxn2PAoLFwijrfH7AYozajJU3If5qIRSbIGPGUI4glLRaPhPcnTC_UjYouMBt3sVMMPwgIhzflgbaeGRCfgP_L7zQqYoVpEOhRRXd_svgdhXGDBg0xgr/s1600/Joachim+Beuckelaer+-+The+Fish+Market.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="216" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVJust9bRZg0dX67VhbCxjkhAbMxn2PAoLFwijrfH7AYozajJU3If5qIRSbIGPGUI4glLRaPhPcnTC_UjYouMBt3sVMMPwgIhzflgbaeGRCfgP_L7zQqYoVpEOhRRXd_svgdhXGDBg0xgr/s320/Joachim+Beuckelaer+-+The+Fish+Market.jpg" width="320" /></a>The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7#P2903">Do not eat any blood, whether from a mammal or a bird, no matter where you may live</a>.” However, that only concerns the blood of animals, who walk on four legs. How do we know the law regarding blood of those who walk on two legs (humans), the blood of eggs (either chicken eggs or testicles), and blood of creepy crawlies (such as rats)? After all, humans are fundamentally different from animals in that they transmit severe ritual purity when dead, while animal meat can transmit only the light impurity of foods. 
<br />
<br />
But is that so? What if one plans to eat a piece of human flesh, doesn't it receive food impurity? – No, it has a more severe impurity of a dead body! But what if one took a piece less than an olive volume and added it to other food, so that it does not have the impurity of a dead body? – His intention accomplishes nothing: since people in general find human flesh repulsive, his intention to eat it does not give it the status of food. 
<br />
<br />
Blood of grasshoppers and fish is completely permitted, because they themselves do not require kosher slaughter. However, if it is collected in a vessel, it needs to have a sign, such as fish scales, so that people would not mistake it for animal blood.

Keritot 22 – Offering Of Uncertainty For Misappropriation

<br />
<br />
What happens if one is uncertain if he committed misappropriation? For example, there were two pieces of meat in front of him, one sacrificial and one ordinary, and he ate one of the pieces, but does not know which one? Rabbi Akiva requires him to bring an offering of uncertainty. Even though this is not a standard case of more serious uncertainty, where one could be cut off from the spiritual source and needs temporary suspension of his judgment, Rabbi Akiva has his reasons.
<br />
<br />
The Sages, among them Rabbi Tarfon, disagree, and say that one need not bring this offering. Rabbi Tarfon explained, “What's the point of him bringing a guilt offering now, if he will bring another guilt offering for misappropriation later on? Rather, he should pay the money, bring a guilt offering and make a condition: if he committed misappropriation, here is the offering, and he did not, let it be an offering of uncertainty.” Rabbi Akiva answered him, “What if we are talking about misappropriation of  a large amount? Is it not better to bring an offering of uncertainty, and pay the full amount only if he is indeed liable" – since doubtful payment becomes a donation to the Temple and is not returnable? For small amounts Rabbi Akiva later agreed with Rabbi Tarfon.

Keritot 23 – Two People Ate Two Pieces Of Meat
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5h65CstHdV46Hfu_sORCLO5ut-1GDgo6cjS3knEhRIc57KDxptdSqB8FVK7sbcigqZZkj_3YLN1IXRHd12epZ27gjWpHsTFSCBcacIDis6lr81Ausx3GO26vu6x8uR2KtcSypHLSBIe8d/s1600/Jeremias+van+Winghen+-+A+kitchen+interior+with+a+maid+preparing+meat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5h65CstHdV46Hfu_sORCLO5ut-1GDgo6cjS3knEhRIc57KDxptdSqB8FVK7sbcigqZZkj_3YLN1IXRHd12epZ27gjWpHsTFSCBcacIDis6lr81Ausx3GO26vu6x8uR2KtcSypHLSBIe8d/s320/Jeremias+van+Winghen+-+A+kitchen+interior+with+a+maid+preparing+meat.jpg" width="239" /></a>If there were two pieces of meat, one ordinary, and another of consecrated meat, and one person ate one of them, the Sages say that he need not bring an offering of uncertainty, but Rabbi Akiva says that he does. This is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/keritot-22-offering-of-uncertainty-for.html">the ruling we saw before</a>. However, if now he ate the second piece, then all agree that he needs to bring a guilt-offering for misappropriation of Temple property.
<br />
<br />
If one person ate the first piece of meat, and then came another person and ate the second piece, the second person did not have a choice. Nevertheless, each one of them needs to bring an offering of uncertainty – this is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Earlier we saw an <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/keritot-17-offering-of-uncertainty.html">argument whether a choice between two objects is required for uncertainty</a>, or if a doubt about one object is sufficient, and Rabbi Akiva holds that one object is sufficient.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that since between the two of them they have certainly committed a transgression, there is no uncertainty here. Rather, they bring a guilt-offering in partnership, and stipulate, “If I am the one who committed misappropriation, this is my offering, but if you did – then I relinquish my ownership, and the offering is yours.” Rabbi Yose says that one cannot divide guilt in this manner, and &nbsp;thus the argument reverts back to Rabbi Akiva and the Sages.<br />

Keritot 24 – Offering Of Uncertainty – When There Is No Uncertainty Anymore
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQvdN4b0rJEpF6aZH8A2CVFYVNKrZis6FJijBC32N_t-uAJrpuLwdBVudvkH1-So30qCJ5qxPMdjjeR-uqW7p5fb1RLF7uHaWrIdRD6WuMkZePHtDVQ4usqyCpoLN2aP789MHa7EQybKlm/s1600/Jan+Van+Leemputten+-+A+shepherd+and+his+flock.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="220" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQvdN4b0rJEpF6aZH8A2CVFYVNKrZis6FJijBC32N_t-uAJrpuLwdBVudvkH1-So30qCJ5qxPMdjjeR-uqW7p5fb1RLF7uHaWrIdRD6WuMkZePHtDVQ4usqyCpoLN2aP789MHa7EQybKlm/s320/Jan+Van+Leemputten+-+A+shepherd+and+his+flock.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
If one was bringing an offering of uncertainty, and meanwhile it was discovered that he did not sin – the animal goes out and grazes with the flock – so says Rabbi Meir. We can understand that: his consecration was in error and is now annulled. However, the Sages say that the animal is a sacrifice, and has to be redeemed once it gets a blemish: since the owner of the sacrifice was worried about his transgression, his sacrifice was brought because of his worry, not because of a certain transgression, and thus the animal is indeed a sacrifice. Now he doesn't need the sacrifice – but the redemption is still required.
<br />
<br />
If the uncertainty became clarified after the animals was slaughtered but before its blood was thrown on the Altar, the sacrifice becomes invalid. Its blood is poured out, and its meat is burned in the place where other invalid offerings are burned.
<br />
<br />
If the uncertainty became clarified after the blood was thrown, the situation is reversed: the sacrifice is completely valid, since it atoned for a doubt that existed when it was brought, and its meat is eaten.

Keritot 25 – When Can One Bring An Offering Of Uncertainty

<br />
<br />
Bava ben Buta followed the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer and brought an offering of uncertainty every day, except after Yom Kippur. He said, “I swear by this Dwelling Place that if my colleagues allowed me, I would bring it – but I accede to their request not to bring it unless there is at least some possibility that I may have transgressed.”
<br />
<br />
The Sages say that one brings an offering of uncertainty only when he might have transgressed a serious prohibition, for which he would otherwise have to bring a sin-offering. If one had an obligation to bring such offering, but Yom Kippur passed, he is now atoned for, provided that he repented and that he believes in the power of Yom Kuppur to atone for it.
<br />
<br />
A woman who possibly had to bring a bird as a sin offering, due to a doubtful birth, still needs to bring it after Yom Kippur, since this bird does not atone but rather allows her to go into the Temple and eat sacrifices. If one had an obligation for a definite sin-offering, Yom Kippur does not cancel that.<br />

Keritot 26 – Misusing Sacrificial Money
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

If one designated two selah coins for his guilt offering (a ram, which should cost two selah) but instead got a good deal: he bought a ram worth two selah for half-price, and additionally bought another ram, then he can only bring one sacrifice – the one for two selah. The second ram did acquire sanctity, because it was bought with sacrificial money, but cannot be brought, since the owner has already fulfilled his obligation with the first ram. Therefore, the second one is let to graze until it develops a blemish, then it is redeemed, and the money it put into the box called, “the summer of the Altar.” When the Altar had no sacrifices (which usually happened in summer months), this money was used to acquire and bring sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
If instead of buying sacrifices he bought two rams for regular use, he committed misappropriation. The first ram becomes a guilt-offering for misappropriation, and the second one – a repayment of sacrificial money.
<br />
<br />
If he used part of the money for a sacrifice, and another part for a ram for regular use, the first rams serves to fulfill his initial guilt-offering obligation, while the second one should be consecrated and offered as a guilt-offering for misappropriation.

Keritot 27 – One Cannot Re-Use A Sin-Offering

One may not even bring his sin-offering, which designated to atone for one transgression, for his other, and even if it is exactly the same. Thus, if one designated a sin-offering for forbidden fat he ate last evening, he cannot bring it to another for the forbidden fat he ate today. Why is all this? Because the Torah said, “he shall bring his offering for his transgression,” and two extra words “his” exclude any re-use of a sin-offering.
<br />
<br />
If a wealthy individual designated money for the purchase of a female lamb as his sin-offering, and then became moderately poor, he can use this money to bring a bird instead. If he became even poorer, he could use the money to bring his flour offering.
<br />
<br />
The other way around is also true: if we was very poor and designated money for his flour offering, but then prospered to the point of being only moderately poor, he can add funds and bring a bird. If he became wealthy, he can use the money (and add some more) and bring a female lamb.

You might think that this is because lambs are superior – to dispel this notion, the Torah puts a she-goat before the lamb for a sin-offering, to tell you that they are equal.”
<br />
<br />
“The Torah also mentions the father before the mother everywhere that they are written together. You might think that this is because the obligation to honor a father exceeds that of honoring a mother – to dispel this notion, the Torah said that one should revere his mother and his father, to tell you that they are equal.”
<br />
<br />
The Temple Courtyard cried in anguish four times, the last one when Yissachar the High Priest performed service in silk gloves, putting his honor too high. What happened to him? Once King Yannai and his queen were talking; the king said that goat meat was better, the queen – that lamb meat was better. They asked Yissachar, who told them, “If a goat is better, let it be offered as a daily offering.” As he was talking, he was gesturing arrogantly and irreverently toward the king with his hand, and the king commanded that his right hand be cut off. However, Yissachar gave a bribe, and they severed his left hand. When the king found out, he commanded to cut off his right hand as well.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef said, “Praised be God for cleaning Yissachar in this world, for his reward (Sachar) is coming to him in the World to Come.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Ashi said, “Did he ever learn the rule of Rabbi Shimon that the goat and the lamb are equal?” Ravina said, "He did not even learn Torah, which states the same."<br />
<br />
Torah scholars, on the other hand, increase peace in the world, as said by Isaiah, “And all your sons will be disciples of God, and abundant will be the peace of your sons.”

Keritot 3 – Can One Transgress All Thirty-Six Prohibitions?

We have said that one who transgresses all thirty-six prohibitions in one period of forgetfulness has to bring a sacrifice for each one. But why not bring one “mistake offering” for all? Rabbi Yochanan explained, “Just as the Torah singled out relations with one sister – which it already prohibited – for a separate violation, so too all other violations are separate.” However, others learn the rule of separate sacrifices from an extra word “woman” in the phrase “woman who did not go to a mikva.” How do they use the prohibition of a sister? – To teach that one who has relations with his sister who is also his father's and his mother's sister, brings three sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
Still, can one violate all thirty-six? Some are applicable only to women, and some – only to men. For example, a woman who brings an animal on herself is liable, but a man is not liable for the same act. On other hand, a man who has relations with another man, is liable, while the woman, of course, is not. So, whether it is talking about a man or a woman, we never get the full count of thirty-six!? – It is talking about a man, but in two different situations: one who cohabited with a male, and another who had a male cohabit with him, and it follows the opinion of Rabbi Ishmael, who counts these as two separate prohibitions.

Moreover, one who eats this fat&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/03/keritot-2-why-count-cases.html">runs the risk of being cut off from his spiritual source</a>.
<br />
<br />
Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7#P2900">Any fat (chelev) of ox, sheep, or goat you shall not eat</a>” and mentioned each animal category separately, one who eats all of these fats needs to bring a sacrifice for each one – this is the opinion of Rabbi Ishmael. The Sages disagree and say that he only needs to bring one sin offering for all. What is the reason for their disagreement? We can say that they argue about this exact principle: since the Torah gave a general prohibition (any fat), accompanied by details, then Rabbi Ishmael says that one is liable for every specific details, while the Sages say that one is only liable for the general prohibition.
<br />
<br />
In the same phrase where the Torah prohibited eating the internal fat (which is normally sacrificed), it also prohibited consuming blood: "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=3#P2793">No fat or blood shall you eat</a>." However, these is a rule that a punishment cannot be administered unless there is both the prohibition and the punishment specified. Where is the punishment for eating blood? - In the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=17#P3247">Blood is the life-force... whoever eats it will be spiritually cut off</a>."

It was used to consecrate  the Kohanim and the articles used in Temple service. The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=30#P2402">Take the finest fragrances: 500 shekels of distilled myrrh, … one who blends a similar formula, or places it on an unauthorized person, he shall be cut off spiritually from his people</a>.” However, if one prepared the anointing oil to learn how it is to be done, or to present it to the community for their use, he is exempt. Likely it is even allowed in the first place.
<br />
<br />
Moses made the anointing oil by boiling cinnamon roots in a “hin” of olive oil, then adding spices. Other say that the roots were soaked in water, to preserve the oil. Regardless of the order, all agree that multiple miracles happened with this oil. The amount of oil was only twelve lugin (between one and two gallons), and it sufficed to anoint the Tabernacle, all of its vessels, Aaron and his sons, all the high priests and kings after that, and it still remains intact for the future. 
<br />
<br />
How do we know all this? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=30#P2411">This will be for Me an oil of sacred anointment for all your generations</a>.” The word “This” (Zeh, ), has the gematria of 7+5=12, and when God says “for Me,” it always means that it will endure forever.

Keritot 6 – How To Improve One's Luck

<br />
<br />
We see thus that one can use sign, or omens, to influence his luck. For example, if one wants to know if his business venture will succeed, he can raise a rooster (who is quick and industrious), and raise him for the sake of his venture; if it grows plump and fine, he will know that he is likely to succeed. In the same vein, one should be accustomed to eat at the beginning of  new year (Rosh HaShanah) a gourd, fenugreek, leek, beets, and dates, because these grow speedily and some are particularly sweet.
<br />
<br />
However, how do omens work and why is it not prohibited divination? The basic premise is that God wants to do good for men, thus, giving credence to a good omen is not divination but just confirmation of this intent. However, believing in negative omens would indeed be divination, and in additional would not be a wise things to do – for this may bring more worry to a person and lead to a weakening of his luck. That is why the omens above mention only the possibility of positive outcome.

Keritot 7 – How Not To Use The Anointing Oil

However, for putting this oil on animals, utensil, or idolaters one is not liable. Why not? Since the idolater is not prohibited from smearing this oil on himself, others are likewise not liable for putting it on him.
<br />
<br />
If one anoints Jewish kings or High Priest with anointing oil, and if these people were already anointed, so new oil is not needed for them, then Rabbi Meir holds him liable, while Rabbi Yehudah exempts him. The argue about the status of a person who initially was authorized (needed the oil) but is now unauthorized (does not need the oil) – is such a person considered a “stranger.” We find that they disagree about this principle in other areas, such as the status of daughter of a Kohen who married to an regular Jew – does she have the rights and responsibilities of the daughter of a Kohen or not.
<br />
<br />
Sin offerings are not necessarily brought for inadvertent serious mistakes; sometimes they are brought in the course of regular life. If a woman miscarried a child, she has to bring a regular sin-offering, the meat of which is eaten by the Kohanim; if she aborted, but it is not known if the fetus was normal, she brings an offering which is not eaten; and one who aborts on the fortieth day after conception or earlier does not bring any sacrifice.

Keritot 8 – One Childbirth Sacrifice After Another

What happens if during this time she again conceived and then miscarried? 
<br />
<br />
Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai argue specifically about a case when she miscarried on the night after eighty days has passed. Beit Shammai exempt her from a second offering. Since this was night, and no offerings are brought in the Temple at night, she could not have possibly brought her first one. Therefore, the second incident is merged with the first one, and her one offering, in which she is already obligated, suffices. Beit Hillel, on the other hand, reason that since eighty days have passed and she will be able to bring her sacrifice on the morrow, then even now she is considered in the new time period, and her miscarriage creates an obligation for a new sacrifice.
<br />
<br />
It once happened that the price of birds, usual sacrifices after childbirth, rose twenty-five times, to a golden dinar. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel then swore by one of the seven Heavens, called “Dwelling Place,” that the price will go down to silver dinars. He promulgated a law that a woman who needs to bring multiple offerings can bring only one. One of the possible explanations for this law is that a poor woman is indeed required to bring only one offering, and under these circumstances everyone was considered poor.

Keritot 9 – One Sacrifice For Many Mistakes

However, there are cases when one brings an offering for intentional acts, such as relations with a slavewoman designated for another, a nazir who went to the cemetery, and one who swore a false oath of testimony.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, usually one bring a separate offering for each transgression, but there are cases where one offerings covers all, such as relations with a slavewoman designated for another and nazir who went to the cemetery multiple times.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chanina asked Rabbi Yochanan, “If one has relations with multiple slaveswomen in one period of forgetting that this is not allowed, how many sacrifices does he bring?” Rabbi Yochanan answered, “Five.” Rabbi Chanina continued, “How is this different from five separate cohabitations with one slavewoman, for which one brings only one offering?” Rabbi Yochanan answered, “It is five different bodies.” Rabbi Chanina asked, “What is the source for this rule?” Rabbi Yochanan answered, “...<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=19#P3299">and she is a slavewoman</a>” is an extra word, which teaches the additional liability.
<br />
<br />
If a jealous husband warns his wife not to seclude herself with many specific man, and she secludes herself with each one, he brings only one barley offering in the Temple.

Ketubot 10 – Claims of "not a virgin" and their results

A particular groom appeared before Rav Nachman, claiming an "open entrance." Rav Nachman told his attendants to give the man lashes with palm branches because "the prostitutes of the city of Mevarechta must be lying in front of him" for him to know whether his wife was a virgin with such certainty.
<br />
<br />
But it was Rav Nachman himself who said that the man is believed!? – Yes, he is believed, but he is flogged for his past promiscuous behavior. Others say there is no contradiction: a widower would be believed with such a claim, and a bachelor would not. 
<br />
<br />
Another groom came to Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince's son, claiming that he did not find blood. Rabban Gamliel examined the cloth he wiped himself with and, after washing, found blood there. Yet another groom came to Rabbi Yehudah and claimed that he did not find blood, while his wife claimed that she was a virgin at the time of marriage. Rabbi Yehudah saw that their faces were dark from malnutrition, so he commanded his servants to take them into a bathhouse to be bathed, make a feast for them, and bring them into a room. They now found blood, and Rabbi Yehudah congratulated them. He applied to them a phrase from Lamentations, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3204.htm">their skin cleaved to their bones and became dry as wood</a>."<br />

Actually, there were 394 courts in Jerusalem and the corresponding number of schools for adults and children, but we are talking only about judges promulgating new decrees.
<br />
<br />
Each of these judges had a court of twenty-three people, with a budget of ninety-nine maneh, to support the court members and their families. This amounted to 140 zuz per family per year, about 70% of the Ketubah amount on which a woman can live for a year. The court salaries came from the Temple treasury. 
<br />
<br />
A judge named Karna would take payment from both litigants and then judge them. How is that possible, being that it amounts to a bribe? It is forbidden to take a bribe to judge incorrectly or even correctly, even if the judge may miss a chance to make a living!? – Karna was a well-known wine taster; by smelling the wine in the storage, he could advise if it should be sold immediately. Since he was losing these definite earnings, he was allowed to take payment for lost wages.
<br />
<br />
Shmuel was once crossing a bridge, and a man helped him. Shmuel immediately disqualified himself from being a judge in his case. Even praise is considered a bribe.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yishmael had a sharecropper who would bring produce due to Rabbi Yishmael every Friday. Once, he brought it on Thursday, saying he had a court case, so he brought the fruit earlier. Rabbi Yishmael disqualified himself from judging but went to listen to the proceedings and found himself constantly advancing the best arguments for the sharecropper in his mind. He said, “If I, who did not accept the bribe, and the produce was mine anyway, react so, then how much more false is the judgment of one who accepts bribe!”

Rav Anan, who was a judge, said, "I am not taking your fish, and I am disqualified from judging your case." The man said, "Giving a present to a righteous man is like bringing the best sacrifice in the Temple; please accept." Rav Anan, who has disqualified himself from the case, accepted the gift. Still, this is what happened.
<br />
<br />
Rav Anan sent the man to Rav Nachman's court, saying that he, Rav Anan, was disqualified from judging it. Rav Nachman assumed that the reason was that Ran Anan was a relative of the man and treated the man with honor. Seeing this, the man's opponent was confused in his arguments and lost the case.
<br />
<br />
Consequently, the Prophet Elijah, who used to visit Rav Anan every day, stopped coming. Rav Anan fasted and prayed, and Elijah came back, but now he had a scary appearance, and Rav Anan had to study with Elijah while hidden in a box. The first set of teachings, before the incident, is called "The Great Book of Elijah," whereas the second set, after the incident, is called "The Small Book of Elijah," and the above is the reason.

However, right now, she does not have to swear about her claim and is provided with sustenance. Others disagreed, but Chanan's law was accepted.
<br />
<br />
But in general, do we really provide sustenance by selling the estate? – If he left not on good terms, we can believe he left her nothing. But typically, does a man leave his house empty? – For these reasons, Shmuel ruled that the court does not give her sustenance. What about the ruling of Chanan? Even those who disagreed with Chanan only argued about an oath but not sustenance. Can we assume that Shmuel is wrong? – No, Shmuel will tell you that Chanan was talking about a specific case where there is a rumor that the husband died. Then we can give her sustenance, but not in the usual case. 
<br />
<br />
Rav disagreed with Shmuel: there is no reason to suspect the wife, and sustenance is given to her, even including money for fragrances.

Ketubot 108 – One who puts his money on the horns of a gazelle

As we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/ketubot-107-husband-went-on-trip.html">learned</a>, his possessions may even be sold for this purpose.
<br />
<br />
Imagine that someone else, the husband's benefactor, decided to provide for the wife's upkeep. Even though he thus saves the husband from potential losses, the husband, when he returns, has no obligation to repay his benefactor. In general, if one pays up his fellow's debt, that fellow does not have to compensate for this – this is the opinion of Chanan, one of the two judges we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/ketubot-105-judges-salary.html">met before</a>.<br />
<br />
Other Sages (who were sons of High Priests) disagree and require the husband to reimburse the benefactor. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai concurs with Chanan and expresses it thus: "The benefactor is like one who puts his money on the horns of a gazelle" (where he is likely to never see it again).

Ketubot 109 – The girls should be supported

However, some of his seven decrees were hotly contested. Here is one example.
<br />
<br />
By Torah law, when a man dies, only his sons get a portion of his inheritance, not his daughters. The Sages changed this in favor of the daughters: if there is enough money in the estate, the daughters are supported until they marry or grow up, and the sons divide the rest of the inheritance; but if there is not enough money, then the daughters are supported from whatever there is, and the sons can go begging.
<br />
<br />
Admon argued: just because they are males, they should lose all? Instead, divide the estate equally! – but the Sages still did not agree, and their logic was that the boys could look for sustenance easier than the girls.
<br />
<br />
Another example is if the bride's father promised money to his son-in-law as dowry but defaulted, the son-in-law can insist on his rights and say that he is not marrying until the promise is paid – or until the bride's hair turns white. 
<br />
<br />
Admon suggested that the bride should argue thus: “I could understand this if it was I who promised the money, but it is my father, so what am I to do?” She can then force the groom to either marry her or write her a Get releasing her. This reasoning of Admon was accepted.

Ketubot 11 – How much a husband owes to his wife
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6S8_5aadyFMUFpdW0j0aMwtk-WgcAXCkwbGFuHccdj4h5RXa7MlXQKMEtMa4PPJzRDI6KT_Tfdve6IspHsDrjBVMMAOR55SXdfwzaYj9W5BTVAY0YIQCbjkxJKoNlfhMO9kk25pV8F80w/s1600/Head+of+a+Dead+Young+Man+by+Theodore+Gericault.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="301" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6S8_5aadyFMUFpdW0j0aMwtk-WgcAXCkwbGFuHccdj4h5RXa7MlXQKMEtMa4PPJzRDI6KT_Tfdve6IspHsDrjBVMMAOR55SXdfwzaYj9W5BTVAY0YIQCbjkxJKoNlfhMO9kk25pV8F80w/s1600/Head+of+a+Dead+Young+Man+by+Theodore+Gericault.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
The marriage contract, called Ketubah, obligates the husband to pay his wife 200 zuz upon their divorce or his death. How much is that? The calculation is based on the silver contents of a zuz, subject to the discussion of whether by zuz we mean a pure silver coin or one mixed with seven parts of copper. This amount  is estimated today at 100 pounds of silver, or about $25,000. This is roughly the amount one can live on for a year.
<br />
<br />
However, this amount applies only to a virgin who has never been married. If a woman has been engaged and not married but divorced or widowed, her Ketubah is still 200 zuz, and here too, the husband can raise a “claim of virginity.” If she is found not to be a virgin, his marriage is considered an acquisition made by mistake, and she loses all or some of the amount.
<br />
<br />
A woman who has been in marriage –&nbsp;her Ketubah is 100 zuz. In addition to this amount, the husband may, and often does, promise a much more significant sum. This is called the “additional amount of the Ketubah.”
<br />

Ketubot 12 – What they did in Judea
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHjUUp1M77nbjvKGldAXiqU2jhkEfsNfUEtnXDlXBHnV0loxT7CB20g1Sm9WzUuFGJy0YlgPfLTCK5VmL7r5K-HZoLdDdv7HjH_r2dCRayySb8RxKRMbgzJb2Etfqo5vm76EVnmhcE3bSy/s1600/Difficult+Bride+by+Pavel+Andreevich+Fedotov.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHjUUp1M77nbjvKGldAXiqU2jhkEfsNfUEtnXDlXBHnV0loxT7CB20g1Sm9WzUuFGJy0YlgPfLTCK5VmL7r5K-HZoLdDdv7HjH_r2dCRayySb8RxKRMbgzJb2Etfqo5vm76EVnmhcE3bSy/s1600/Difficult+Bride+by+Pavel+Andreevich+Fedotov.jpg" width="320" /></a>In Judea, people had the custom of celebrating the engagement with a big meal in the bride's father's house. Often the groom was left alone with the bride. This was done for him to become familiar with her. Another reason: ruling princes used to claim the right of the first night. If the bride was familiar with her groom, she would not submit willingly, and a woman who is violated is still permitted to her husband. However, because of the possibility of them cohabiting before the chuppah, in Judea, the groom could not claim "not finding signs of virginity" in his wife and thus could not deprive her of the full amount of the Ketubah obligation based on this claim.
<br />
<br />
So far, we have never considered what the bride replies to the groom's claims. Let's look at this situation: the groom says he did not find her a virgin. She explains that true, she was not, but that was because she was violated while being engaged to him, and thus he still owes her the amount of Ketubah if she becomes divorced or widowed, and this is a case of "your (buyer's) field became inundated," so it is his loss. He says that perhaps it is not so, but instead, she was not a virgin when she got engaged to him, so his marriage to her was a "mistaken buy," and he does not owe the amount of Ketubah. 
<br />
<br />
Rabban Gamliel says that she is believed. Why? Because her definite claim wins against his claim of "perhaps." Even though his argument is bolstered by the fact that the money is now in his possession - she has the right to the complete Ketubah.

Ketubot 2 – Marriages are for Wednesdays

This engagement had more legal power than today: they were husband and wife, except not living together. When the time came to marry, girls for whom it was the first marriage would get married on Wednesdays. Why specifically on this day? Courts used to convene on Thursdays so that if he had any questions about his wife, he could come to court on the morrow. For example, if he had suspicions that she was unfaithful to him, judging by the fact that she was not a virgin, he could come to court and expect that the publicity caused by his actions could bring in witnesses of her unfaithfulness if such there were.
<br />
<br />
But why make a wedding on a Sunday, since the courts convened on Mondays (and Thursdays)? – Because then he would only have one day after Shabbat to prepare a wedding feast, and the Sages wanted the daughters of Israel to be respected with a celebration.
<br />
<br />
The bride lives in her father's house all the year of engagement. Once the year passes, the husband starts to supply for her needs even if the marriage is delayed. The Talmud discusses this obligation of his under various unforeseen circumstances.

Ketubot 22 – I was married, but I am divorced now

Then she states: “Actually, I was married but divorced." She is believed and does not need to present the divorce letter, "Get." Why? Does not she render herself prohibited to the whole world with the first statement? – No, because we apply the principle of "the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits."&nbsp;In other words, we only know that she was married on her own terms. Now that she says that she is divorced, we believe that also. 
<br />
<br />
A similar example: a woman who says, "I was abducted by idolaters, but I am pure,"&nbsp;is believed and can get married to a Kohen – even though usually any woman who had relations with an idolater cannot marry a Kohen any longer. If we only know about her capture from her, we believe her other statement. If, however, there was a witness to her being captured, she must bring more decisive proof.
<br />
<br />
Compare this to a case where a woman says that she was married and then – that she was never married. Now she is not believed. Why not? Because, unlike the first case, her second statement contradicts the first. She must give a plausible explanation. For example, a charming woman used to say that she was engaged, but then she got engaged to one of her new suitors. She explained that previously unfit people used to woe her, and to get rid of them, she claimed that she was already engaged and that now a proper person came. She was believed.

Their father, Shmuel, placed guards over them so that they would not be violated by their captors. Shmuel said to his father, "And until now, who guarded them?" This was logical but not according to human dignity, so the father of Shmuel remarked, "And if these were your daughters, would you treat them as lightly?"<br />
<br />
Occasional remarks by a righteous may take effect, and later the daughters of Shmuel were indeed captured. The captors brought them to Israel for ransom. The knowledgeable women left their captors outside and entered the court of Rav Chanina. Each of them declared, "I was captured but am pure." According to the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/02/ketubot-22-i-was-married-but-i-am.html">previously stated rule</a> that "the mouth that forbids is the mouth that permits," they were believed. When their captors entered afterward, it made no difference.
<br />
<br />
Rav Chanina said, "These are children of a legal master," and indeed, it was found that they were Shmuel's daughters. 
<br />
<br />
If two women were captured by idolaters, but unlike in the case before, there were witnesses to their capture, and each of them said, "I was captured, but I am sure," – she is not believed because we know about her capture independently, and not only from her words. However, if each testifies about the other that she is pure, they are believed.

If one says, "I am a Kohen," and the other says, "I am a Kohen," – we do not believe him. But if they testify about each other, they are accepted.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: we should never establish a person as a Kohen (to allow him to eat Kohen's portion) through the words of one witness, especially here, where they may have colluded to testify for each other.
<br />
<br />
But is it true that Rabbi Yehudah suspects collusion? Didn't we learn this case: if two vendors of produce come to a town, and one of them says, "My produce is not properly tithed, however, his produce is" – we do not believe his testimony because we suspect that in the next town they will say the reverse, and this is a ploy to inspire credibility, and here Rabbi Yehudah permits to buy their produce. But he should suspect them and forbid it! 
<br />
<br />
Explained Rav Adda bar Ahavah, "Someone has learned this ruling about vendors wrong. He exchanged his opinion. Exchange them back, and Rabbi Yehudah is the one who suspects collusion."
<br />
<br />
Abaye said, "No need to exchange opinions! Rather, here it is different because vendors are selling doubtful tithes, "d'mai," and this is not such a strict prohibition, so Rabbi Yehudah believes them anyway. Then how do the Sages disbelieve? – They say that if he has his wares, weights, and scales, it is evident that he denigrates his produce only because of collusion.

<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah, who required two witnesses, has a reason for this. Suppose he sees a man eating the Kohen's portion (terumah). In that case, he will presume that this is a genealogically pure Kohen and permit him to marry without further investigation. Thus, if we were to allow one witness to testify about a Kohen regarding terumah, this would automatically count as evidence for family matters, which cannot be because two witnesses are required in all family matters. The other point of view is that eating terumah does not mean that he is a pure Kohen; thus, we can accept one witness for this. 
<br />
<br />
A man told Resh Lakish about another man: "I know that he is a Kohen because he was always called first to read from the Torah." Resh Lakish answered, "Did you also see him receive terumah?" Rabbi Elazar objected, "And if there were no granaries there, you would not have any Kohanim," but Resh Lakish did not accept it.
<br />
<br />
Later, Resh Lakish heard this from his own teacher, Rabbi Yochanan. He was cross with Rabbi Elazar: "Had you told me it was from Rabbi Yochanan, I would have believed you right away!"

Since by molesting her, they would be found guilty and may forfeit their rights to the money, they would be careful and refrain. 
<br />
<br />
However, if she is imprisoned for a capital crime, she will be forbidden to her husband (the Kohen) if she is released – because the idolaters have nothing to risk and may molest her. A Kohen may not be married to a woman who has illicit relations with an idolater, even against her will. A different way to explain these rulings is in regards to even a husband who is not a Kohen. Here, the suspicion is that she submitted to one of her captors willingly – which would prohibit her for her current husband.
<br />
<br />
There was a Jewish girl in Ashkelon who pledged herself to idolaters as security for a debt; the loan was not paid, and she temporarily became the property of the idolaters. She was married to a Kohen, and her family distanced her from him and other brothers in case he died. Her servants who testified to the event also testified that she was never secluded and was not violated. The family did not want to believe the servants, but the Sages said, "Either you believe them that she was pledged and also that she is pure, or don't believe them even that she was pledged!" This is another example of the rule, "the mouth that forbids also has the power to permit."

Ketubot 27 – A siege

However, if there is a hiding place in the city, then each woman can be presumed to have been hiding there, and thus all women are permitted to remain with their husbands. Also, if she has any one witness, this suffices. 
<br />
<br />
This rule does not seem to agree with another law about soldiers: if a marauding troop came to a city, then in the time of peace, open barrels are prohibited, but closed ones are still permitted – since it is presumed that the soldiers drank from the open ones and made libations. However, at the time of war, all barrels are permitted – because the soldiers do not have time to turn away to wine. We see then that the soldiers are busy with war! – True, they won't have the time for wine, but they will have the time for women. 
<br />
<br />
All of the above is true for the enemy army, but a friendly army will not antagonize the citizens. What about a single marauder of even a friendly army, who may separate from the group and enter a city? – We are talking about a situation where the groups of soldiers see each other, so he can't sneak in unnoticed. And yet, the guards may doze off? – We are talking about a case where the city is surrounded by chains, dogs, spikes, and geese to stop and scare off marauders. Others, however, do not require all these precautions against marauders.<br />

For example, one can say, “I recognize the handwriting of my father, or teacher or brother, which I saw when I was young,” and he would be believed in court.  
<br />
<br />
Why do we need all three cases? – You might say that he knows his father's handwriting because he is always around his father, but not so for the teacher. Or you might say that he respected his teacher, which is why the teacher's handwriting made a more significant impression on him – and so on – that is why we need to be told that all three testimonies are accepted.<br />
<br />
But why, in general, do we believe him? Isn't this a money matter, and we have a rule that all money matters can be established only by the testimony of two adult witnesses; this one was a minor when he saw the signatures? – In truth, confirming signatures is an idea of the Sages. Really we need people who remember the signing event, and people are testifying about that, signatures being just the beginning of the testimony. The Sages thus were able to add leniency to their own law.
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, one can testify about a woman that he saw her wedding, and she was coming with a veil and her hair down, as was customary of virgins. Thus, she is entitled to a larger Ketubah payment. Again, why do we believe this kind of a witness in money matters? – Most women marry as virgins, so his testimony reveals to the public that the court's decision is correct.

He is also liable to regular damages for assault: pain, humiliation, and depreciation. Furthermore, if she and her father desire, he must marry her and may never divorce her against her will.
<br />
<br />
This law applies primarily to a young girl who just became a bat mitzvah (12 years) and thus an adult but has not become a more grown-up (12 ½ years). The penalty still applies if he rapes a girl who is a mamzer and whom he is prohibited from marrying. It also applies to all who were converted or ransomed before they were three years of age. 
<br />
<br />
Similarly, if one violates girls prohibited to him on pain of karet (being cut off from the people) – such as his sister, brother's wife divorced before chuppah, or a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">niddah</a> – the penalty is the same.

Ketubot 3 – A parent dies before the wedding

By contrast, with divorces (Get), we do not pay attention to any unforeseen circumstances. For example, there was a case where the husband gave his wife a Get on the condition that he did not come back within a year. On the last day, he was coming but was delayed by the river. Even though he cried from the other side of it, “See, I came back!” – the divorce had already taken place. Why did the Sages establish this rule? – To help modest women, who would be still waiting for their husbands, saying that perhaps he did not fulfill the condition of the divorce due to an unforeseen circumstance; and also to stop the immodest ones who would get married by saying that the husband gave her a valid divorce, when in fact we were prevented from returning.
<br />
<br />
A law about marrying only on Wednesdays does not apply today. Even back when it did, people might be prevented by an unavoidable circumstance and get married earlier, such as Monday. What unavoidable circumstance could that be? Imagine that the mother of the bride or the father of the groom dies just before the wedding – and the feast is already prepared. In that case, they do not delay the wedding but rather delay the burial. All the time the parent is not buried, his children are not considered mourners. Thus, they can proceed with the wedding, consummate the marriage, and then the groom (if it was his father who died) observes the seven days of mourning.

Ketubot 30 – The logic of punishment

We also said that he still bears the penalty if he cannot marry her because of another prohibition.
<br />
<br />
However, some say that the Torah only meant for two things to go together, and if he cannot marry her (such as in the case of a girl who is a mamzer), he does not pay the penalty either. He would still pay the regular assault damages. And yet, if he violates a girl who is a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">niddah</a>, they agree that even though he deserves the punishment of being cut off from the people, he still pays the penalty.
<br />
<br />
Why should the last be true? We have a rule that when one causes damages but simultaneously puts his soul in danger, he is only given the harsher penalty but is free from repayment!? – That law only applies to actual execution by the court, but not to that by the hand of Heaven. 
<br />
<br />
The last explanation still does not work according to Rabbi Nechunia ben HaKanah, who makes all kinds of danger, whether by the hand of man (court) or Heaven (cut off), the same so that he would not pay the penalty for violation. – True, according to Rabbi Nechunia, he does not pay the penalty for violating a niddah because he puts his soul in danger.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, all mishaps that happen to a person are considered by the hand of Heaven, except for illnesses that come from too cold or too hot weather because the person's negligence causes him to become sick.

He does not have to pay the penalty of fifty shekalim. However, the prototypical example of this is found on Shabbat, when one steals a purse from a house and then carries it into the street. Since for carrying the load into the street on Shabbat, he is liable to death by the Court, he does not have to pay the penalty for stealing and only has to return the stolen goods. This will apply even if he is not executed, such as if there were no witnesses or no proper warning.
<br />
<br />
And yet, what are the precise circumstances of his stealing? If he lifts the purse while in the house, he acquires it right then and there, becomes liable to return double, and Shabbat violation – which comes only later, when he crosses the doorstep – would not relieve him of the penalty. The Talmud tries to construct various ways of his walking where this would be true but finds faults with them. The final conclusion is that this applies when he is dragging the purse on the floor since he only acquires it when he crosses the doorstep – and then the Shabbat violation happens simultaneously with stealing.

If one violates his virgin sister, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/03/ketubot-29-rapist.html">he pays the 50-shekel payment mentioned earlier</a>. However, when we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/06/makkot-13-when-is-penalty-of-lashes.html">studied corporal punishment in detail</a>, we said he gets lashes for the same thing!?
<br />
<br />
In explaining this, Ulla suggested that corporal punishment applies because he violated his sister, who is somewhat grown up, past 12 ½  (no penalty,) and is mentally deranged (no humiliation payment). And yet, she suffers pain! – We conclude that he seduces her (no pain). 
<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, we see that it is crucial for Ulla to defend his principle that if one faces two punishments, lashes and a money payment, he should be given the less severe money penalty. But usually, we give him the more stringent one, on the theory that the punishment is for the correction of his soul. So, where does Ulla get his principle from?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries to derive this from logic (because such a proof would be preferred) but ends up using the comparison based on similar words. The word “tachat” in the sense of “as a compensation for” is used talking about the girl and in the “eye for an eye” – where we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/03/bava-kamma-83-aspects-of-injury.html">know very well that the Torah meant a monetary payment, and not taking his actual eye out</a>.<br />

Ketubot 33 – Which is worse, torture or death?

On the one hand, they should repay the money which the subject of their testimony would otherwise have lost since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=19#P5420">do to them what they schemed to do to their fellow</a>.” On the other hand, they transgressed a very serious prohibition of being false witnesses and perhaps should be given lashes, like for any prohibition on the Torah. Which should apply?
<br />
<br />
Said Abaye: “We cannot give them lashes because we cannot warn them, and if we do warn them, they will refuse to testify!” Later Abaye disproved himself and said: “They did not warn the man about whom they testified falsely, so they themselves also should not require a warning.” But the fact remains that they pay and are not lashed.
<br />
<br />
Comparing death with torture, Rav said, “Even though Chananya, Mishael, and Azaryah were ready to give up their lives but not bow down to an idol, had they whipped them, they would bow.” We thus see that when choosing a punishment, the court must consider whiplashes stricter than death. However,  Rav Samma, the son of Rav Ashi, said to his father, “That is not the same! The court gives a fixed number of lashes, but the torture continues!” Others read this statement of Rav completely the opposite, as a question: “Even if they tortured them, would they bow down to an idol? -- Surely not!” Under this reading, idol worshiping would be permitted when faced with torture, but Chananya and his friends went beyond the letter of the law.<br />

To understand this deeper, let's consider another case: someone steals a sheep or an ox and then slaughters and sells the animal on Shabbat. Typically, one who steals and slaughters pays a special five-fold penalty for the ox and four-fold for the sheep (because, presumably, he carried the sheep on his shoulders, and this humiliation atones for a small part of his penalty).
<br />
<br />
However, for slaughtering on Shabbat, he deserves stoning. We would expect that he gets the toughest of the punishments and does not have to pay. And yet, Rabbi Meir requires him to pay four- or five-fold. Our solution: he does not slaughter the animal himself; instead, he instructs someone to do it. He is indeed liable for stealing the animal, slaughtering it, and selling the meat, because just as selling is done with the help of another, so can slaughter be done through an agent – but he himself did not violate Shabbat, so he is not stoned. (There is also an explanation for the opinion of the Sages, who do not punish him at all).

Ketubot 35 – A loophole for the death penalty
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIFfrRvl65LJ6OMBO8FwwHdeXDKa4hENhVWKLPZaMRIl60WEmn0KOmomI_Mz7puLzlkUB9SGioxoj6CVUAG1NGMW8AYnbGi_o5N0_Smc12nB-3EMD-8fvfE2uUG9oLm6Br0kT8Hw5G0fDB/s1600/Minna+Wasmann,+the+sister+of+the+artist+by+Friedrich+Wasmann.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIFfrRvl65LJ6OMBO8FwwHdeXDKa4hENhVWKLPZaMRIl60WEmn0KOmomI_Mz7puLzlkUB9SGioxoj6CVUAG1NGMW8AYnbGi_o5N0_Smc12nB-3EMD-8fvfE2uUG9oLm6Br0kT8Hw5G0fDB/s1600/Minna+Wasmann,+the+sister+of+the+artist+by+Friedrich+Wasmann.jpg" width="261" /></a>If one commits an act for which he is liable to pay and also to be executed or given lashes, then he is only given the harsher punishment and does not have to pay. Even if the death penalty or lashes cannot be given due to a technicality, there is a loophole that saves him from payment – this is the opinion of Resh Lakish.
<br />
<br />
Take, for example, a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/03/ketubot-32-corporal-punishment-or.html">case of violating his sister</a>. The only way to be punished is to have witnesses tell him shortly before what punishment he will get (lashes). He has to accept it on himself and proceed. Now, if it all happens as described above, he does not have to pay the penalty for violating a virgin. Resh Lakish takes it further: if he was not warned, the lashes are impossible. Still, he does not have to pay since, had they warned him, he would not have to pay.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan, on the other hand, does not accept this loophole. If, after all, they did not warn him so that the stricter punishment cannot be meted out, he has to pay. 
<br />
<br />
Both use the case of “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=21#P2097">two men fighting and accidentally hitting a pregnant woman, with no fatality</a>” as their source. “No fatality” leads to him paying, but we understand that if there is a fatality, he does not pay, even though he was not warned. What fatality do we mean? – The death of the woman, of course – says Resh Lakish. However, Rabbi Yochanan says that the fatality refers to the man and means that he is sentenced to death. It comes out that if he is not sentenced to death, then he pays, even though there was no warning.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then rejects this explanation of the disagreement and provides a different one.

They put the dead aside for a while, make a wedding, and afterward bury him and observe the seven days of mourning.<br />
<br />However, this applies only if the groom's father or the bride's mother died, but not in the case of any other relative. Why? – In those times, it was customary for the groom's father to prepare the wedding feast and for the bride's mother to provide her with adornments. So there would be no one to assist them otherwise.
<br />
<br />
After he consummates the marriage, the husband separates from his wife for the seven days of the wedding and for the following seven days of mourning and sleeps among men. This is because, after all, the groom is a mourner right after burial. A mourner is forbidden to be intimate with his wife. Thus, although he observes the seven days of celebration externally, he refrains from intimacy as a mourner in private. And even sleeping in separate quarters applies only if he was prevented from consummating the marriage – because then he may be overcome by desire and violate the rules.&nbsp;If he has already been intimate with his wife once, he can be trusted to control himself.

Ketubot 5 – First cohabitation with a virgin

<br />
If the husband did not get a chance to do it before Shabbat, can the first cohabitation take place then? Is the blood produced by rupturing the hymen – is it considered as previously collected (which would be allowed) and is now simply released, or is it considered a wound (and thus prohibited on Shabbat)? And even if you say that the blood is considered just released – is he interested in the blood to establish her virginity, or is he  preparing an opening for future cohabitations (thus making something into a vessel, which would  be prohibited)? And finally, if you again take the lenient approach that he needs the blood, and the opening just happens by itself, is the law like Rabbi Shimon, that unintentional consequences are permitted, or like Rabbi Yehudah, who prohibits it?
<br />
<br />
In the academy of Rav, it was taught that Rav permits it, while Shmuel prohibits it; it came out that they followed the ruling of Rav with a benefit to themselves and allowed it. In the academy of Shmuel, they taught the opposite: that Shmuel permits it, while Rav prohibits it. Again, since they follow Shmuel, it turned out to be a lenient opinion for them.

Ketubot 56 – How much really is the Ketubah payment?

<br />
<br />
If she only received a ring and thus became bound to him, but they have not yet celebrated the marriage with the chuppah and have not started living together, she still already collects the total amount, with the added-on sum, in the event he divorces her or dies. However, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that in the event of this early dissolution of the marriage, she only gets the 200 zuz. The added amount was promised on the condition of her becoming a full-fledged wife.
<br />
<br />
What is the logic of the two opinions? Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah is very clear: a man does not want to give everything away before he has actually enjoyed the benefits of his bride becoming his wife. So we understand his intent. However, the other opinion also guesses his intent differently: why did he add that amount to the 200 zuz? – So that the bride will be suitably disposed toward him and agree to be his wife. This has already been achieved, and therefore he owes the total amount.
<br />
<br />
Even though Rav Nachman cursed any judge who rules like Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, in practice, the law indeed follows him, and a bride who is divorced before chuppah has a claim to only the standard amount of 200 zuz.<br />

Ketubot 57 – Can one dispense with the Ketubah?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxj9o0yXGGdyXbUljzANjTg2aDIzVdgfDp2PjCkBysgaVNR3OUydBWybhUxDdvqiRoARDluIryGwC4Y-NssBYUkzkvzWQ8hyphenhyphenlL_Peq1nKcPiHX0K3_ZD6CQKibMS1rAUMsZ3xAppOxr4kK/s1600/Portrait+of+a+Bride+by++Johannes+Cornelisz+Verspronck.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxj9o0yXGGdyXbUljzANjTg2aDIzVdgfDp2PjCkBysgaVNR3OUydBWybhUxDdvqiRoARDluIryGwC4Y-NssBYUkzkvzWQ8hyphenhyphenlL_Peq1nKcPiHX0K3_ZD6CQKibMS1rAUMsZ3xAppOxr4kK/s1600/Portrait+of+a+Bride+by++Johannes+Cornelisz+Verspronck.jpg" width="267" /></a>As we learned before, the Ketubah is a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/03/ketubot-56-how-much-really-is-ketubah.html">significant monetary obligation on behalf of the husband</a>, which his wife will receive in the event of divorce or his death. Can one reduce the amount?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir does not allow it: anybody who reduces the amount of the Ketubah violates a prohibition but achieves nothing – he still owes the full amount and even makes his cohabitations with his wife akin to promiscuous relationships. That is because his wife, seeing how he treats her like a woman with whom he wants to have few ties, does not trust him; their marital bond is as if severed. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yose permits this outright: the bride will understand the situation. Rabbi Yehudah suggests a compromise: he writes the Ketubah for the full amount, and she writes inside of it that she received a part. Usually, the protective decrees of Rabbi Meir, like this one, win: it is thus prohibited to reduce the Ketubah, and if it is lost, one cannot be intimate with his wife until the Ketubah is replaced.
<br />
<br />
Today, engagement and marriage happen as one step under the chuppah. Earlier, however, the bride was given twelve months to prepare her adornments for the wedding, and similarly, the husband was then given twelve months to prepare the wedding feast. In an extreme case, this would result in twenty-four months before the wedding. Afterward, even if the groom still delays the wedding, he is obligated to provide his bride's support.

What is her status while she is engaged? – Since the Kohen has <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/10/kiddushin-2-ways-to-acquire-woman.html">acquired her as a bride, most likely by giving her a ring</a>, she is considered "acquired by money" and is in the category of people who can eat the priestly portion.
<br />
<br />
However, since she may inadvertently give her cup of wine (for example) to her brothers and sisters – and they should not be allowed to drink it – the Sages decided that the bride does not eat the priestly portion (terumah). Others say that the reason is different: should the husband find some hidden defect, the marriage could be considered a "mistaken buy" and be annulled – and it will turn out that she ate terumah for no reason. Why is the reason important, if any way, she should not eat terumah? – In the case where she has a particular eating place, the first reason does not apply, but the second still does.<br />
<br />
Typically, the husband supports his wife, and she gives him over her earnings. However, this is one of the decrees established for her benefit, and she can opt out of it. She can say, "I don't want your support and will keep my earnings." The Talmud then discusses the status of her earnings should the husband decide to consecrate them to the Temple.

However, the more maidservants she brings into the marriage, the less she has to work, and with four maidservants, she just sits in an easy chair. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says that she always needs to work, at least with wool, for idleness leads to unchastity, while Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that idleness brings to insanity.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chiya disagrees and says that a wife is only for beauty, and she should not do any work that diminishes her beauty. He also taught in another place that a wife is only for adornments, and she should accept them from her husband, while it is his duty to give them to her.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chiya fulfilled his maxim in life: his wife gave him a hard time, and he would nevertheless buy any nice thing he could find and bring it wrapped up as a present. His theory was that it is enough for a wife to save the husband from sin by appearing beautiful, thus preventing him from looking at other women.

How does this agree with other rules in the Talmud?
<br />
<br />
For example, the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">well-known first rules at the beginning of the Talmud talk about reading the Shema prayer at night</a>. There we mentioned that a bridegroom is exempt from saying Shema – because he is worried about upcoming cohabitation with his bride, being unsure if he will succeed in rupturing her hymen and complete the act of cohabitation – and <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-16-workers-and-bridegroom-say.html">this exemption lasts until the end of Shabbat</a>. This must prove that cohabitation with his bride is permitted on Shabbat, contrary to what Shmuel has said!?
<br />
<br />
Abaye answered that the groom is worried that he did not complete the cohabitation the previous night, which upsets him to the point that he can't say the Shema. However, if so, even if his ship is drowning in the sea, he should likewise not say the Shema – and this is not true. We know that even if one is a mourner and thus is aggravated, he only skips the tefillin but still says the Shema. 
<br />
<br />
Rava defended differently: there are two versions of the earlier Shema ruling, and in one of them, he says the Shema on Friday night, while in another, he does not. Thus, Shmuel has at least one source to rely upon – one which permits the reading of Shema – because cohabitation on Shabbat is prohibited, and he has nothing to worry about. The Talmud then discusses methods of penetration that leave the hymen intact and how this relates to the guarding of the bridal sheets.

He came to Abaye to ask whether this was allowed. Abaye gave him many reasons why it was permitted. 
<br />
<br />
Firstly, Rabbi Meir requires her to wait twenty-four months of nursing, but Rabbi Yehudah only needs fifteen months, and the law is always like Rabbi Yehudah against Rabbi Meir. Secondly, many other Sages also allow this. There were other reasons as well.
<br />
<br />
However, Rav Yosef, Abaye's teacher, corrected him: Abaye forgot another rule – when Rabbi Meir suggests a protective decree, the law always follows him. Abaye ran after his sharecropper for three miles, and some say – for one mile in the sand, but could not overtake him.
<br />
<br />
Abaye said: "This mistake happened to me because I should not have decided the law, even if it seemed obvious to me, in the vicinity of my teacher, for this is disrespectful."  
<br />
<br />
And what is the reason for prohibiting such marriage? – If the woman becomes pregnant, the milk may become unfit for nursing, thus endangering the baby.

Ketubot 61 – On the danger of some foods

<br />
<br />
He also added that the wife should not do these three things when she is a niddah – to not&nbsp;endear him too much. However, she can do them with a change or when not in front of him. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yitchak ben Chananiya also said that a waiter serving food must be allowed to try some of it, which refers to meat that gives off a pleasing odor and to pungent wine – or else the waiter will suffer from craving. Others say that this refers to all savory foods. There was a righteous man who would give the waiter from every course – and Elijah the Project would speak to him, while another righteous man only gave from one, and from the rest- after the meal, and with him, Elijah would not talk.
<br />
<br />
There was once a Roman who wanted to marry a particular woman, but she refused. He started eating pomegranates in front of her, and as she swallowed the saliva produced by her desire for it, she finally became all bloated. He made her promise that if he cured her, she would marry him. Then he brought more pomegranates and started eating these, saying, “All saliva that causes you discomfort, spit it out, spit it out!” She did so until something like a green palm leaf shot out of her, and she became healed.

Ketubot 62 – Man's obligations to his wife

If he quarrels with her and, in his rage, vows to never have relations with her, this vow does not take effect because he cannot take away her right. However, if he phrases his vow as “the pleasure of relations with you is prohibited to me,” he has created a prohibition for himself. Since now he is not a good husband, he should divorce her immediately and – because it is his fault – pay her the complete amount of her Ketubah.
<br />
<br />
If however, he limits his abstinence vow for a week or two, then we need to estimate when this situation becomes unbearable, and he has to give a divorce after that. How long is that? Beit Shammai says that it is two weeks. What is their logic? – In the Torah, there is a situation where they have to be apart for two weeks, that is, after the birth of a daughter, but more than this is too much. Beit Shammai compares the situation caused by the husband (vow) to the birth, also caused by the husband. However, Beit Hillel argues that “too long” is one week. They compare this to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">niddah</a>, which lasts for one week and make an analogy between common occurrences – niddah and vows. 
<br />
<br />
Practically, however, people with means and without worries should be intimate with their wives every day, laborers working in town – twice a week, donkey drivers who travel – once a week, and sailors, who are often absent for  a long voyage – once every six months.

First is the blessing on the wine. Then, "Blessed is the One who created everything for His glory." Just as God acted as the best friend at Adam and Eve's wedding, those assembled at the wedding also emulate God.
<br />
<br />
Then, "Who created man" (at first alone), and "Who made a man in His image, and built – hint to a woman -- a building for eternity" – since with a woman there is a continuous cycle of births and weddings.
<br />
<br />
Then, "the barren one should rejoice" – This is Jerusalem, whose needs are to be remembered, especially in the happy moments. Then "Please gladden the hearts of the bride and groom just as You gladdened Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden." 
<br />
<br />
And then, "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created joy and gladness, groom and bride, mirth, song, pleasure, delight, love, brotherhood, peace, and companionship. May there be heard in the cities of Judah and in the city of Jerusalem sounds of joy and gladness, voices of groom and bride. Blessed are You Who gladdens a groom with the bride" – referring to the man's joy with his wife.

Ketubot 84 – The wife, the creditor and the children

<br />
<br />
However, his wife can only take the land since this is what she relied on when getting married, and so too his creditors. The children automatically get all movables and all precious objects.
<br />
<br />
What happens to his things that are deposited with somebody, such as at a bank in a safe deposit box? Since the children have not yet taken possession of them, the court should give them to the underdog, the wife, or the creditor – this is the opinion of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva argues: you cannot base judgment on the feeling of mercy; the objects are given to the children or other inheritors to whom they rightfully belong. Even if the wife or creditor seizes the valuables, the court takes them away from her.
<br />
<br />
Today, when people don't own the land as commonly as they used to, the question is moot since the wife gets her Ketubah paid from all valuables the husband has left. Also, everybody agrees that there is a moral obligation on the children to pay their father's debts; it's just that they cannot be forced to do so.

Here is a story.
<br />
<br />
A man died, and his creditor, Yeimar, sent an agent to seize the man's boat. The agent did so, and as he was towing the boat, he was met by Rav Pappa and Rav Huna. They told the agent, "You are just an agent, not a creditor, so you have no right to seize anything since you deprive other creditors!" Then they seized the boat themselves because they, too, loaned money to the deceased. 
<br />
<br />
So now Rav Pappa rowed the boat while Rav Huna pulled it with the rope, each claiming that he thus acquired the boat. In this way, they came to Rava to (in the language of the Bard) "try whose right, of thine or mine, is most in this boat." 
<br />
<br />
Rava told them, "White geese, you strip clothes off people!" That was a compliment: white because they were old and gray, and geese because it is a sign of wisdom in a dream.  Rava continued, "The law is like Rabbi Akiva, who only allows you to seize the property while the debtor is alive, not after his death!"

There must be a reason, such as a case where one admits to part of the claim and says, "It is true that I owe you money but less than what you say." Then the oath is in order.<br />
<br />
However, if the husband appointed his wife a storekeeper or overseer for his business, he can ask for an oath at any time without a definite claim. This applies to any business partner of whom one may have a suspicion of embezzlement.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says that the husband can impose an oath in any case because it is unavoidable that the wife is an overseer over her spindle and dough. But the Sages say, "One cannot live with a snake in the same basket." If the husband suspects her so much, the wife may not be able to live with him.<br />

Ketubot 87 – Repairing trust

We also mentioned that the possibility of this oath may lead to mistrust between the husband and the wife.
<br />
<br />
To prevent this, the husband may write for her a document stating that he "Will have no right to impose an oath or vow on her," and he then waives this right, although he can still impose the oath on her successor. He may give up the right to impose an oath on others.
<br />
<br />
The purpose of this oath was often to verify that the wife has not yet collected her Ketubah and that she is coming with a valid claim on the total amount. However, there was a strong incentive for the widow to take this oath, even if she had already collected some or all of the payment. She rationalized that she was entitled to extra compensation because of the care she would have to give to the orphans. The courts stopped accepting this oath, and widows had no way of collecting the Ketubah.  To rectify that, the Sages gave the orphans the right to ask her to pronounce a vow (such as "The use of my husband's property is prohibited to me if I embezzled"), and then she gets the Ketubah.<br />
<br />
The standard case where an oath would be present is where the husband claims that he paid his wife the Ketubah, and she says she received only a partial payment. The oath is in order because the one who pays usually remembers his payment well, but the one who receives it is not as careful about the details. The oath makes him better go through his recollections.

Incidentally, such oaths apply to orphans as well. 
<br />
<br />
For example, say that the children of one family, after their father died, claim that the father of the other family (who also died) borrowed money from their father. The borrower's children say,"  "Our father told us that he indeed borrowed, but repaid" – the borrower's children must take an oath. This applies when their father says ""I paid"" for then the existence of the loan document does not prove anything. 
<br />
<br />
However, if their father said,"  "I never borrowed"" then it works against him."  "I never borrowed" means that he, of course, never repaid. Since the loan is uncontested and documented, no oath helps, and the orphans need to pay the debt. Furthermore, this is only when the children are adults, but minors are more protected from the claims of others.<br />

Ketubot 89 – How to collect divorce settlement
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjt2sIZIDGVmBXZqdK99xHEbYogwWupuydyQzMQ_kvlJR0tpjgL5_kGtKIsYdh-47iayamto6Waq2aQEsFdY7jmvBbHZY8Ha-zucqy4-q_gZu8IrVrs10ByLqsXHZsxYPM0HQb6NugUx1hW/s1600/A+group+portrait+of+a+husband,+wife+and+their+child+by++Francis+Alleyne.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="262" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjt2sIZIDGVmBXZqdK99xHEbYogwWupuydyQzMQ_kvlJR0tpjgL5_kGtKIsYdh-47iayamto6Waq2aQEsFdY7jmvBbHZY8Ha-zucqy4-q_gZu8IrVrs10ByLqsXHZsxYPM0HQb6NugUx1hW/s320/A+group+portrait+of+a+husband,+wife+and+their+child+by++Francis+Alleyne.jpg" width="320" /></a>Imagine that a woman comes to court and presents a Get with which her husband divorced her. Then she wants him to pay the amount of the Ketubah. However, she does not have the Ketubah document, claiming it was lost. Normally, she should not be able to collect: anybody who wants to collect payment should present a loan document (in this case, it is the Ketubah). If it is lost, his money is lost.
<br />
<br />
However, since the Ketubah is the enactment of the court, it has the same power as though the document was actually present, so she can collect the money. Her former husband's claim that he paid the Ketubah is not believed. They should have torn the Get, given him her Ketubah or the payment receipt if he paid.
<br />
<br />
Consider the next case: the woman comes with the Ketubah but not with a Get. She wants the payment, but the husband claims that based on the rule above, she already collected her payment with her Get, claiming that the Ketubah was lost, and now she has put away the Get and produced the Ketubah. As for his receipt, he says he lost it. In this case, the husband wins because she does not have a Get and indeed could be collecting the money twice. 
<br />
<br />
Rabban Gamliel adds that in the “time of danger,” people were afraid to keep their Get or Ketubah because the idolaters were persecuting the Jews for the performance of commandments. From this time on, a woman can collect her payment even without the Get because she may have destroyed it right after divorce.

This is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. Others say he would not be believed even for himself since his feelings are subjective. 
<br />
<br />
But according to Rabbi Elazar, even if we believe the husband's feelings, what evidence is there that she was unfaithful to him while being engaged? Perhaps this happened before engagement, and even if not, maybe she is from a family where women do not have significant hymen? – Rabbi Elazar's rules apply only in the case where one betrothed a girl when she was younger than three and married her when she grew up.
<br />
<br />
Shmuel says that the husband is believed to the point that her Ketubah (marriage obligation paid in case of divorce) is void, and he does not have to pay it. But why would he be believed? Perhaps he is just trying to get out of his obligation? – Shmuel will reply that one would not trouble himself to make a wedding feast, only to lose her the next day.

She collects two payments. 
<br />
<br />
However, if she produces two Ketubah documents but only one Get, we assume they are from one marriage, but he simply wrote another Ketubah for her. She collects only one. Finally, if she has two Get documents from him but only one Ketubah, he must have married (and divorced) her again, but anybody who re-marries his wife relies on the original Ketubah, so she again collects only one payment.
<br />
<br />
If one was married to two wives and died, and did not leave enough to pay both, then the Ketubah of the first way has priority over the Ketubah of the second. If the wives died before collecting their Ketubah payments, then the heirs of the first wife have priority over the heirs of the second one.

Ketubot 91 – Two groups of children from two wives want the inheritance

They were apprehensive that when their daughter and her husband died, the inheritance would go to the children of the other wife. Therefore, the Sages established a rule that when the children claim the inheritance, they can ask for their late mother's Ketubah first. Then they would divide the remaining estate equally with the other wives' children. This is called "Ketubah of the (male) children."
<br />
<br />
Now imagine that it did happen: someone was married to two wives, they both died, then he died, and now the children all want the inheritance. This is where the above rule would kick in.
<br />
<br />
However, if there is not enough money to pay both the Ketubah of the first and the second wife, then there will be no leftover inheritance to divide: everything will be paid out as a Ketubah payment. Then the law of the inheritance from the Torah will be abrogated completely!  - at least in this case. The Sages did not want this outcome, so they limited their rule to only cases where there was enough money to pay both Ketubahs and some. If there is not enough, then the rule above is not used; instead, everyone divides equally, which is the Torah law. Even if one group of the children wants to add money to the inheritance so that there is enough for the Ketubah and gain by getting their mother's larger Ketubah, they are not listened to.

<br />
Let us say that debtor D owes $1,000 to his creditor C. Meanwhile, he owns two houses and sells them to buyer B, each for $500.
<br />
<br />
Now C wants his money, and D cannot pay, so C repossesses the first of the houses because real estate always guarantees the loan. B loses one of the houses he bought. Still, he wants to keep the second one, so he comes with $1,000 cash to C and proposes the following: if C wants to consider the first house, the one he just repossessed, as worth $1,000, then all is well; but if not, then this $1,000 should cover both houses, and C gets his money but loses the repossessed house.
<br />
<br />
Rami bar Chama wanted to say that this is precisely our previous rule: there, the orphans could not<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/ketubot-91-two-groups-of-children-from.html">&nbsp;artificially inflate the worth of their mother's Ketubah</a>, &nbsp;so here too, the argument of considering the $500 house worth $1,000 does not stand. Without this, the second part of the proposal does not stand either, and the creditor can collect the second house. However, Rava reversed him: in the case of orphans, their suggestion would hurt the other group of children, but in our case, the creditor would always get his $1,000 loan back.
<br />
<br />The following cases are abbreviated with mnemonics ("thousand" - that is our case, "hundred," "mitzvah of Ketubah"...). Such abbreviations, or "signs," contain clues to the mystical meaning of the subjects discussed.

Kiddushin 10 –  Betrothal by relations

<br />
Is there a practical difference between these theoretical derivations? – Imagine that ten men cohabited anally with a betrothed girl who is a virgin. According to the first way of learning, she is still a virgin after each act since only the husband makes her a non-virgin with anal cohabitation; therefore, each man is to be punished by stoning, specified for violating a betrothed virgin. According to the second approach, though, she is a non-virgin after the first act, and the next nine men are subject to a lighter punishment of strangulation. 
<br />
<br />
Exactly what stage of cohabitation accomplishes kiddushin? Typically, for infidelity and prohibited relations, the first stage of relations, member touching (discussed in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/11/yevamot-56-what-is-legally-considered.html">another place</a>), is considered the act. However, for kiddushin, it is different. Since the man intends complete penetration, he achieves kiddushin only when this is done. Practical difference? – Can he inherit his wife or bury her if he is a Kohen.
<br />
<br />
Since there are two stages in marriage, betrothal (dedication) and chuppah (bringing the bride into the husband's domain), a question may be asked: if one does betrothal through cohabitation, does it accomplish the second stage of marriage – that is, is the second cohabitation or a chuppah still needed? After multiple arguments back and forth, it is concluded that cohabitation only accomplished betrothal, but a chuppah is still required.

2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father;<br />
3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty;<br />
4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile.<br /><br /><div>
A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave woman to have children.<br /><br />Even today, there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaanite slave woman.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Seated Man with a Youth &amp; a Servant in an Interior by Michael Sweerts</div></div>

<li>death of his master.</li>

In addition to a Hebrew servant's ways, a Hebrew maidservant sold by her father goes free when she reaches twelve years of age and has “signs of physical maturity” (two pubic hairs).<br />

When a Hebrew servant or maidservant goes free, they receive severance gifts.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;The Farewell By Eugene De Blaas</div>

<br />
<br />
She may be acquired through money, a document of betrothal, or cohabitation. Two witnesses are needed to testify in case of money and document. In case of acquisition by cohabitation (which is not encouraged), the witnesses testify to the declared intention and the seclusion.
<br />
<br />
She acquires herself back through a Get or through the death of her husband.
<br />
<br />
Passive use of “she is acquired” instead of “he acquires” teaches that a woman can only be acquired willingly, not against her will.

<br />
Real property may be acquired using money, a document, or a proprietary act such as locking the gate. Movable property may be acquired only by "drawing it near." To protect buyers, the Rabbis abrogated the power of money to acquire so that sellers would guard the sold goods after receiving the money.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;Royal Elephant At The Gateway To The Jami Masjid Mathura by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Rudolf Ernst&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

This is similar to someone who lost a precious stone on a beach. Who searches after whom? Obviously, the one that lost his possession searches for it.
<br />
<br />
We mentioned that betrothal can be done with money. Why is that so? Furthermore, there is a related law that a father can give his daughter away in marriage when she is young; in that case, the money the groom pays goes to the father. 
<br />
<br />
Both questions have the same, if non-trivial, answer. This is derived from the law of a Jewish slave girl. The father can sell his daughter as a servant. In this case, it is understood that when she grows up, the buyer will take her as a wife or designate her for her son. She goes free if none of these happen, and the Torah adds, "No money!" We already know that "free" means "no money." So we understand that it is in this case that there is no money, but in another related case, there is money. And when is it? When a woman gets married, or when the father gives her away in marriage.
<br />
<br />
That is exactly what we wanted to demonstrate, that the betrothal which will lead to marriage (chuppah) can be done with money.
<br />
<br />
Today both events happen under the chuppah in close succession: first, the groom gives money (or a ring) to the bride, then the ceremony is concluded under the chuppah, which symbolizes the new home.

Reverence means that the son may not sit in his father's place; he may not contradict his father in words in his presence – but he may offer challenges to his father's position until a conclusion is reached.<br />
<br />
Honor means that he must give his father food and drink, dress and cover him, bring him in, and take him out.<br />
<br />
The same applies to his mother.<br />

Kiddushin 4 – When a man takes a wife

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/03/kiddushin-3-who-searches-for-whom.html">Earlier, we saw</a>&nbsp;one way to derive that marriage can be effected by giving the bride-to-be a ring or another object of value. However, it was based on taking the extra word "money" from a different place in the Torah and applying it to our context.
<br />
<br />
A more direct way is to take the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=24">When a man takes a woman and has relations with her... if later he does not like her, he can divorce</a>."" This clearly describes the situation of marriage and uses the word "take." The same word "<b>take</b>" is found when Abraham buys a field from Efron and says, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=23#P585">I gave you the money for the field, <b>take</b> it from me.</a>" We thus see that "take" has a meaning of acquiring with money.
<br />
<br />
Now this calls for some logical acrobatics. Look at a Jewish female slave, who cannot be acquired by having relations with her and is acquired only with money; a wife, who is acquired by relations, is undoubtedly acquired with money! Therefore, we don't need the derivation above at all!!
<br />
<br />
No, because a Yebamah case disproves this. Look at Yebamah (one's dead brother's wife), whom the remaining brother has to marry. She is acquired by cohabitation – and nevertheless, she is not acquired with money. So the above logic breaks: someone acquired with relations is nevertheless not acquired with money.
<br />
<br />
However, we can deflect this attack: Yebamah has an inherent weakness in that she is not acquired with a document, whereas a wife <b>is</b> acquired with a document of intent to marry.<br />
<br />
Thus, we saw an attack, a deflection of this attack, and then a deflection of this deflection.  We see at least why the proof based on the word "take" helps.
<br />

Thus, a man cannot say to a woman, "I forgive you the loan, and with that money become betrothed to me," because at this time the money is hers. Instead, he can forgive her the loan and betroth her with the benefit she receives from no longer having to repay him.<br />
<br />
If a man said to a woman, "Become betrothed to me with $100", but gave her only $1, she is betrothed, and the man must pay later.<br /><br />

Kiddushin 48 - Betrothal with Loan Collection Rights or with Labor
If a creditor sells a note of indebtedness to his fellow and afterward forgives the debt - it is indeed forgiven. Therefore, if one betroths a woman by giving her a loan document for collection, she may  fear that he will forgive the debt, and thus she does not wholeheartedly commit herself to the betrothal, which is therefore void.<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZVtHHV-Sdo6KPPpjzlUWx4Gl4pMesnswcEhH5n9q0b_6aAi3AO6fc9Uvb-lgYw4dmKCWC8M9fE0FVBdB966EpyVYrz4-IxUg0L34nBM86Z51_OLHvPgTp10eDz2dNY7LpoSxYnNNRLUNE/s1600-h/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272816239931524994" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZVtHHV-Sdo6KPPpjzlUWx4Gl4pMesnswcEhH5n9q0b_6aAi3AO6fc9Uvb-lgYw4dmKCWC8M9fE0FVBdB966EpyVYrz4-IxUg0L34nBM86Z51_OLHvPgTp10eDz2dNY7LpoSxYnNNRLUNE/s200/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 117px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br />

If a woman handed a piece of gold to a craftsman and said to him: "Fashion for me anklets, earrings, or rings, and in return for your labor, I will become betrothed to you," - it is betrothal with a loan, which is invalid.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Still Life Jewellery Casket by Andries Vermeulen</div>

When a man gives a woman money or items worth money and says, "Behold, you are betrothed to me - Harei at mekudeshet li," and she agrees, she is betrothed.<br />
<br />
Anyone who does not know the laws of divorce documents and Kiddushin should have no dealings with them, for an unwitting error in the decision could prove intractable.<br />
<br />
A woman can not be betrothed by forgoing the repayment of a loan. The loan is given for expenses, with the obligation to repay. Thus, he is not giving her anything of value at this  moment.<div><br /></div><div><div>How about a document? A document is drafted by a man, and it states that a woman is hereby betrothed to him. The Kiddushin is effected when the man gives the document to the woman.</div><div><br /></div><div>Why does this work? Because “And she will leave the first husband's house, and she will go and be a wife unto another man.” Since “leave” can be effected through a document, so too “be” can be effected through a document.</div><div><br /></div><div>But if so, can divorce be effected by money? - No, because a defender cannot become an accuser. And while the documents would be different and distinct, money would be the same.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;A Young Lady and a Cavalier by Frans Francken (III)</div>

Abaye: If a man betroths one of two sisters and does not know which, she is betrothed. However, since he does not know which of the two is his wife, he must give both a Get. According to Rava, Kiddushin should not even take effect!<br />

Why are the birds of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath">metsora</a> forbidden for benefit? The procedure requires slaughtering one of them, then dipping the other one into the blood and letting it go free. It is performed outside the city but is compared to sacrifices inside the Temple, which are prohibited for benefit. The bird which is let free is afterward not prohibited for benefit, for the Torah would not create a stumbling block.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Boy with Bird by Peter Paul Rubens</div>

Regarding idolatry, it says, "You shall not bring it into your house and become banned like it," which means that whatever you generate from the sale of idols is forbidden, but other money is permitted. But this may teach the rule, not an exception. - No, because there is another exception where money is forbidden: the fruit of the seventh year. Money from the sale of other items is permitted.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Terracotta Idols Of Tabasco, From The Ancient Cities Of New Mexico, by Claude Joseph Desire Charnay</div>

But if he uses a different unequivocal formula, it also works. For example, "Behold, you are my wife," "You are my betrothed," and "You are acquired to me" are all valid declarations of kiddushin.<p></p><p>What if he uses expressions that hint at the language of the Torah but can be interpreted otherwise? For example, "You are singled out for me," "You are my helpmate," "My <i>taken</i> one?" The Talmud resolves at least the last question positively because the Torah said, "When a man shall <i>take</i> a woman."</p><p>Let's return to the "You are singled out for me" question. What are the exact circumstances here? If they are talking in general about the subject of marriage, and then he gives her the money, even if he does not say anything else, she is betrothed. And if they were not talking about marriage, what is she agreeing to? The answer is that if he is silent, she is indeed betrothed. It is when he adds these words, does he maybe mean to hire her for work? And here, the Talmud does not have an answer.</p><p>Art: The Betrothal by Jacobus Buys</p><p><br /></p>

A man in Pumbedita offended Rav Yehuda. The man used to call other people slaves. Rav Yehuda excommunicated him and pronounced him a slave. In the court of Rav Nachman, Rav Yehudah explained that he pronounced the man slave because he called others slaves. Usually, this only allows one to suspect, but on that day, Rav Matna, who had not visited Pumbedita for 13 years, came and confirmed that the man was  a slave, and more blemishes were discovered.<br />

Shetuki (his unmarried mother silences him when asked about the identity of his father) should not marry an Israelite of unblemished lineage. Even though he is Kosher, since most of the men who might have been his father are Kosher, this is an additional measure to protect genealogical purity.<br />

Does the woman, who is not an appraisal expert, rely on his words and wholeheartedly commit herself to marriage? The prevailing ruling is that she does.<br />
<br />
If a man said to a woman, “Become betrothed to me with $100,” but instead gave her an item as collateral, she is not betrothed. She did not receive the promised money, nor was collateral given as a gift.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;Silks and Satins,&nbsp; 1900 Posters</span></div>

The bride is symbolic of Tzedek - righteousness and also of being poor. When given a coin - a prutah - the minimum amount for giving, she symbolizes Tzedakah, charity.

Kiddushin 9 – Betrothal in earnest

Let us look at some marginal cases.
<br />
<br />
If a woman on a cruise takes the betrothal money (a hundred zuz, about $5,000) from the man but immediately throws it overboard the ship, she is not betrothed. But we just said it!? – You might think that – since she would be obligated to return the money if she does not get married – she actually means to accept but tests the husband in his anger management. So the teacher had to tell us that she was not betrothed because she did not voice an agreement.
<br />
<br />
Another example: a man was drinking in a bar, and a woman came over and said, "Give me a drink." He said, "If I do, will you become betrothed to me?" She replied, "Do pour a drink!" – Here, too, she is not betrothed since she agreed to the drink, not the marriage.
<br />
<br />
In addition to money or valuables, a man can betroth a woman with a document, where he writes, "With this document, you become betrothed to me." This is derived from other sales laws, and it applies even if the paper on which it is written is not worth anything. Just like a bill of divorce, this document must be written with her in mind. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, one can engage a woman by having relations with her – provided that he announces to the witnesses that this is his intent and then secludes himself with her. This is derived from the words "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=22#P5487">who cohabited with her husband</a>."<br />

If he is a student of Torah, we exile his teacher with him, because a student cannot survive without the one who teaches him Torah. From here, we see that  a person should not teach a disciple who is not of good character. Furthermore, if the teacher is exiled, his academy is exiled with him.<br />
<br />
Rav Chama used to say, "If <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/25-8.htm">God guides sinners on the way</a>,&nbsp; He surely guides the righteous."<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish used to explain the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-13.htm">but God caused it to come to his hand</a>" with this example. Two people killed a person, one inadvertently, and one intentionally, but there were no witnesses against both. God causes one to sit under a ladder while the other one descends, falls on him, and kills him, this time with witnesses. One is thus executed, and the other is exiled.<br />

This includes any High Priest: one who was anointed with oil or by wearing special garments, and even one who served temporarily. Rabbi Yehudah says, “Even the High Priest who is anointed for war.” Therefore, the mothers of High Priests would supply the exiles with food and clothing, so that they would not pray for their sons to die.<br />
<br />
One whose sentence was finalized when there was no High Priest, one who accidentally kills a High Priest, or a High Priest who killed – these never leave the city of refuge. <br />
<br />
One may not leave the city of refuge for testimony regarding a mitzvah, a monetary dispute, or capital punishment. Even if all Israel needs him, and he is like the general Yoav, the son of Zeruyah, he never leaves.<br />
<br />
If a killer left the boundary of the city of refuge and the redeemer of the blood found him, Rabbi Yose HaGligli says that it is a mitzvah for the redeemer to kill him. Everybody else is allowed to do so, but Rabbi Akiva says that it is permissible for the redeemer, and everybody else is liable to death for killing him.<br />

Rav Ashi says, "Also the branches," which changes the ruling to say just the opposite: the killer is protected if the tree is inside and he is under the leaves outside.<br />
<br />
If an exiled killer inadvertently killed someone else in that city of refuge where he resides, he is exiled from his neighborhood to a different neighborhood. If a Levite inadvertently killed someone in his home city, he is exiled from his city to another city.<br />
<br />
If a killer was exiled to a city of refuge and the townspeople wanted to honor him, he must tell them, "I am a killer." If they wanted to do it anyway, they were allowed to do so. In the six designated cities of refuge, the killer does not have to pay rent. The other forty-two cities of the Levites also serve as cities of refuge, but the killer who resides there has to pay rent. <br />
<br />
After the killer returns home, Rabbi Meir says that he returns to the position of authority he had occupied previously, but Rabbi Yehudah says that he does not.<br />

The total number of such prohibitions is 207. The following list contains novelty points, for example, even though the ones in the first group carry the penalty of being cut off from the people, and lashes still apply:<br />
<br />
One who cohabits with his sister, aunt, his wife's sister, or a woman who did not immerse herself in a mikveh. A High Priest who cohabits with a widow, or an ordinary kohen who cohabits with a divorcee. A ritually unclean person who eats sacrifices, or one who enters the Temple while unclean. One who eats chametz on Passover, or one who works on Yom Kippur. One who eats meat of any animal that was not slaughtered properly, and one who eats unkosher fish, birds, insects, reptiles, and rodents.<br />

However, Rabbi Yishmael allows both lashes and the death penalty because it is all "one long death."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yitzchak says that one is cut off for relations with his sister, but does not get lashes. Talking about the laws of incest, the Torah <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/20-17.htm">repeated the prohibition one's sister</a>. There is a rule: "The exception proves the rule." In our case, when incest with one's sister is prohibited yet again, on the pain of being cut off, this teaches that being cut off is the only punishment for it, and one does not get lashes. It also teaches that one does not get lashes for all other similar transgressions.<br />
<br />
The Sages, who disagree with Rabbi Yitzchak, say that the Torah here speaks about someone who fathered two girls with his mother, then a son with one of the girls, and his son then had relations with the other girl, who is the now his sisterfather's's sister, anmother's's sister – such a person gets three sets of lashes.<br />

In the cases where such a warning cannot be stated with certainty, is the court still allowed to administer lashes?<br />
<br />
For example, one proclaims, "An oath that I will eat this loaf today!" If he is warned in the morning that he had better eat the loaf, or else he will receive lashes, this is an uncertain warning, because he may still eat the loaf later on. This applies throughout the day: he cannot be told with certainty that if he does not eat the loaf now, he will incur lashes, since he can eat it a while later. He could potentially be warned on the very last moment of the day, but it is practically impossible. In this situation, Rabbi Yochanan says that an uncertain warning is legal; however, he does not receive lashes because he does not act. On the contrary, Resh Lakish does allow lashes even for no action, but Resh Lakish considers an uncertain warning invalid. Thus, according to both, he does not receive lashes, but for different reasons.<br />

Makkot 16 – Remedy for  Transgression

In this case one is not punished with lashes. Rabbi Yochanan learns from here that had the Torah not provided the remedy,  he would be punished, even though this is an example of an uncertain warning. Thus, one can get lashes with uncertain warning. Resh Lakish learns that had the Torah not provided the remedy, he would be punished, even though the transgression of leaving over involves no action. Thus, one can incur lashes for the prohibition that does not involve action.<br />
<br />
If one ate an ant, he is liable to five separate sets of lashes – two for eating creeping things, and three for land varieties. For a hornet, he is liable to an additional set for creeping things that fly. If one mashed nine ants and then added another live one, and the live one completed the volume of an olive, he is liable to six sets, the last one for an olive's volume of non-kosher meat.<br />
<br />
The same law would apply for mashing one ant the size of an olive, but such ants are rare.<br />

In contrast, reading the verses is not essential and does not invalidate the ritual."<br />
<br />
But did Rabbi Elazar really say this? Didn't he say the opposite in the following ruling: "If one separated first fruit before Sukkot, and Sukkot has passed, and he didn't bring the first fruit, they must be left to rot." Why is this? Isn't it because the owner can no longer say the verses over them? This proves that Rabbi Elazar considers the verses essential!<br />
<br />
The answer is similar to Rabbi Zeira's principle. Rabbi Zeira has said that flour offerings must be mixed, and even if they are not mixed in practice, this does not matter as long as the volume allows it to be mixed. However, if the volume is too large for mixing, the offering is invalid. By the same token, one must be able to say the verses. Not saying them is acceptable, but not being able to say them invalidates the ritual.<br />

<br />
However, this notion is refuted by comparison with the firstborn animal. The second tithe and the firstborn animals had to be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there. And, just as the firstborn animal can only be offered at the time when the Temple stands – because it needs to be sacrificed at the Altar – so too the second tithe can be eaten in Jerusalem when the Temple stands. <br />
<br />
This argument, however, has an internal weakness: firstborn requires that its blood be placed on the Altar, which is a stringency that the second tithe does not have. Then, how do we know not to bring the second tithe today? Only from the verse, “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">In the place where He will choose to rest His name – there you will eat second tithe and the firstborn animals</a>.” Since they are placed next to each other in the same verse, they have the same law.<br />

They come to court and state the following: "We testify about a certain man (who until now was presumed to be a qualified Kohen), that he is a son of a divorced woman. Later, they are found to be plotting witnesses: two other witnesses came and asked them, "How can you say that you saw this woman being divorced when on that day you were with us in a different place?"<br />
<br />
It is impossible to apply to them what they wanted to inflict on the defendant, even if they are Kohanim. If we disqualify the children of the witnesses, we will violate the commandment of "do to them (but not to their children) what they wanted to do to him." And if we do not disqualify their children, this is not right either because they did want to disqualify the defendant's children. Therefore, they get the punishment of forty lashes instead.<br />

<br />
One who makes a single cut  over five dead people, or one who makes five cuts over one dead person, is liable for lashes for each dead person and for each cut.<br />
<br />For rounding the corners of the head, one gets two sets of lashes, one for one side and one for the other.<br />

For destroying the five corners of the beard, a person is liable to five sets of lashes. Rabbi Eliezer says that if he cut them as one, he deserves only one set. One is not liable unless he shaves his beard with a razor, but Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable even for shaving with planes.<br />

Rabbi Shimon's opinion is that one is only liable if he tattoos the name of an idol.<br />
<br />
If a nazir was drinking wine all day, he receives only one set of lashes, following the first warning in the morning. If they kept warning him, and he kept drinking, he is liable for each warning. Similarly, if he was in the cemetery all day, he receives one set of lashes, but if they warned him against every entry, he is liable every time. If he was shaving his head all day, he is liable once, but if they warned him about every hair, he is liable every time.<br />
<br />
There is a case where one plows a single furrow and is liable for eight prohibitions: if he plows with an ox and a donkey, and they are consecrated, and he covers mixed species in a vineyard, and he does so on a Sabbatical years and on a Yom Tov; and he is both a Kohen and a nazir, plowing in a cemetery.<br />

Rabbi Yehudah says that this means exactly forty. The court assesses how many lashes the transgressor can stand, and chooses a number divisible by three. If in the middle of giving him lashes, he appears weak, they stop the lashes, and he does not have to endure more.<br />
<br />
The attendant of the court binds his hands on either side of the post, grasps his garments, and pulls them away from the area to be lashed, and if they tear, they tear. A stone is placed behind the one being lashed, and the attendant stands on it with the strap in his hand. The whip is made of two calfskin straps with additional straps of donkey hide; the whip's handle is one handbreadth, and the length of it is such that its tip should reach the beginning of the stomach when he is lashed across his back.<br />
<br />
The reader reads appropriate verses to him. If he died as a result of lashing, the attendant  is not liable, but if the attendant gave an extra blow and he died, the attendant goes into exile like all who kill by mistake. If the lashed one lost control of his bodily functions and soiled himself, he is exempt from any further lashes.<br />

<br />
Excision (karet) is also translated as being cut off. One opinion is that it entails both the premature death of the sinner and the loss of his future generations. "Premature death" is death at the ages of fifty through fifty-nine, or even at the ages of sixty through seventy-nine if the death is sudden.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chananya ben Gamliel also said, "If a person who commits a single transgression punishable by being cut off forfeits his life, then if he performs a single mitzvah, how much more so should his life be given to him."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that you can derive this better. The verses say, "My laws by which you shall live... The souls that do incest will be cut off." We see from here that whoever desists and does not do a transgression is given a reward of the one who performs a mitzvah.<br />

Later, they were found to be false plotting witnesses.<br />
<br />
In this case, they cannot be made to pay the full value of the Ketubah, which they wanted the husband to lose, because he may have to pay her the Ketubah anyway if he divorces her or dies. Instead, the court estimates the trade value of the Ketubah, that is, how much someone would be willing to pay for that woman's Ketubah, on the understanding that he may not get the payment at all and the false witnesses pay this amount to the husband.<br />
<br />In a similar case, two witnesses said, "This man borrowed money and needs to repay it within thirty days," whereas in reality, the loan term was ten years. If they are found to be false witnesses, they  pay the amount that a person is willing to pay for having the loan in his possession for the extra time, and this is not prohibited interest.<br />

Makkot 4 – The Basic Case of Plotting Witnesses

They pay their victim the amount they intended to make him lose since lashes and repayment come from different places in the Torah – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that whoever pays does not receive lashes since a person cannot be liable for both lashes and monetary payment for the same crime.<br />
<br />
If they said, "We testify about this person that he is liable to forty lashes," and they are found to be false plotting witnesses, they receive eighty lashes – these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages make them liable to only forty.<br />

Makkot 5 – The Form of Testimony that Establishes Witnesses as False

If they said, "How can you testify about a murder when this murder victim, or this alleged murderer, was with us in a different place on that day?" they have attacked the testimony but not the witnesses themselves. However, if the new witnesses said, "How can you testify about this event when you were with us on that day in a different place?" the first witnesses do become plotting false witnesses and are executed on the words of the second set of witnesses.<br />
<br />
Suppose the witnesses are convicted as plotting false witnesses. In that case, they divide the monetary compensation they must pay to the intended victim, but if they are liable to lashes, they each receive their lashes. That is because lashes are comparable to capital punishment, and since there is no execution in half, there are also no lashes in half.<br />

However, there is an overriding rule that one cannot derive capital punishments by logic – only those that are explicitly mentioned in the Torah are to be followed.<br />

What does the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">by the word of two witnesses or three witnesses shall the one who is to die be put to death</a>" teach? That the law of three witnesses is the same as that of two witnesses: to be established as false plotting witnesses, all three have to be established thus.<br />

<br />
If two witnesses testify that a person was sentenced as a murderer by a particular court and name the time, place, and witnesses in the case, that person is executed based on their words.<br />
<br />
A Sanhedrin that executes once in seven years is called a destroyer. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says, "Once is seventy years." Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say, "Had we been on the Sanhedrin at the time when they still performed executions, no person would ever been executed." Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "They would just increase the number of murderers in Israel" because they would have eliminated the criminals' fear of retribution.<br />
<br />
One who kills a person inadvertently is exiled into a city of refuge. If one was lowering a cask from a roof with the rope and it fell on a bystander and killed him, the killer is exiled, but if he was raising a cask and the cask fell and killed, the killer is not exiled.<br />

<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">When one is killed by the "<a href="" target="_blank">wood of the ax</a>", Rabbi Yehudah the Prince understands it as a wood chip, but the Sages say that it means that an axe head slipped off the wooden handle.</span>&nbsp;Therefore, if the victim was killed by the axe-head, Rabbi Yehudah classifies this as gross negligence, when the killer does not go into exile, because it does not help him, but the Sages say that this is precisely the case of the exile. If the death was caused by a woodchip from the tree that is being chopped, then according to Rabbi Yehudah, the killer is exiled, but according to the Sages, he is free from punishment, because the killing was inadvertent.<br />

<br />
An "enemy" is one who deliberately avoids speaking to the victim of an "accidental" killing for three days. An "enemy" is not exiled, because he can't claim accidental killing. Rabbi Yose says an "enemy" is considered forewarned and therefore is executed. Rabbi Shimon looks at the circumstances of the case.<br />
<br />
There were three cities of refuge in Transjordan, and three in the land of Canaan. Direct roads were constructed to facilitate getting to a city of refuge. The court would provide the accidental killer with two Torah scholars, and they would try to dissuade the avenging relative from wishing to attack.  Then the court would bring him from the city of refuge and determine the degree of his responsibility.<br />

Then, during the fourteen years of conquering Israel, the Tabernacle was in Gilgal. It was temporary, and although sacrifices continued there, personal altars were also allowed.

<br />
<br />
Why did Ahashverosh invite the subjects from distant lands first? Some say that he was clever – the people of his own capital city Shushan he could appease any time. Others say that he was stupid: he should have invited his closest people first, and they would have protected him in case of rebellion.
<br />
<br />
The students of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai asked him, "Why were the 'enemies of Israel' (euphemism for the Jewish people) on the brink of extinction?"  He said, "You say the reason." They answered, "Because they ate at the feast of Ahashverosh." He questioned, "If so, only the people in Shushan should have been punished." They then asked, "And what is your reason?" Rabbi Shimon told them, "Because they bowed down to an idol." The students then asked, "If so, they should not avoid punishment!" He told them, "They did not mean it and lacked conviction. So too, God did not mean it and only scared them."
<br />
<br />
What does it mean, "On the seventh day, the king's heart was merry with wine." And before it was not? – However, this was Shabbat, when people relaxed. When the Sages relax, they discuss knowledge and praise God. But his guests, when relaxed, started discussing which women, Persian or Midian, were the most beautiful. This led the king to tell them that his wife Vashti was from the nation of Chaldeans and was the most beautiful. They asked to see her in the crown but nothing else, but she would not come. Why would not she? Because the angel Gavriel came and made her grow a tail.

Her father died before her birth, and her mother died while giving birth. Mordechai, her uncle, raised her as his daughter. The word "bat" - "daughter" hints at "bait" - "house."

"Since the day that woman came, we never had a good night's sleep."&nbsp; They had to bring drinks to the king all night long. They decided to poison the king. They spoke a rare language of <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=10#C117" target="_blank">Tarshish</a> between themselves. However, they did not know that Mordechai knew that language. In fact, as a member of the Sanhedrin, he had to be fluent in seventy languages. Mordechai reported the plot to Esther. In this way, he saved the king.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Mistress and Maid&nbsp; by Johannes Vermeer</p>

Megillah 15 – The teachings of Rabbi Chanina

Some say that Esther was of unhealthy complexion, and only Divine intervention made her beloved by all; they take out Esther from the list and put in Vashti.
<br />
<br />
Rachav inspired lust by the mere mention of her name. In fact, one who says "Rachav, Rachav" would emit a seminal discharge. Rav Nachman said to Rav Yitchak, "I said it, and I was not concerned." Rav Yitzchak answered, "I meant, only those who knew her."
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar retold the following teaching of Rabbi Chanina: Whoever transmits a teaching and mentions who he heard it from – brings redemption to the world, just as Esther, who "told the king about a plot against him – in the name of Mordechai."<br />
<br />
More teachings from Rabbi Chanina follow.
<br />
<br />
Haman said, "All my wealth is not worth anything to me when I see Mordechai." Why? – Because of an incident when Haman sold himself as a slave to Mordechai, and "all that belongs to the slave really belongs to his master."
<br />
<br />
Another teaching: God himself will be the crown of beauty on the head of every righteous in the future. The Attribute of Justice then said, "How are these (Israel) different from the others?" God replied, "They study the Torah, and the others do not." Then the Attribute of Justice said, "But the wrongdoers among them will still have to give an account," and to this, the Talmud does not give here any answer.

Megillah 16 – Mordechai and Haman

Haman, thinking of himself, said, "That man should be made to ride on king's horse, in king's garments." The king said, "Do this for Mordechai."
<br />
<br />
Haman tried to argue, "Why do you need to do all of this? If you want to thank Mordechai, just give him a village or a river to collect taxes." Ahashverosh answered, "This, too, do for him." That is why Megillah states, "Do not leave out any word of what you have said."
<br />
<br />
Haman went to Mordechai to put him on the king's horse. However, Mordechai said he was weak from the fast and could not mount the horse by himself. Haman had to bow down and allow Mordechai to step on him. As he was climbing the horse, Mordechai also kicked Haman. Haman asked him, "How can you do this? Your own king Solomon tells you, 'When your enemy falls, do not rejoice.'?" Mordechai answered, "That is said about a Jewish enemy. But about you, it says, 'You shall tread upon their high places.'"
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then turns to the story of Benjamin, from whom Mordechai descended. When Joseph received his brothers in Egypt, he gave Benjamin five portions of food and five garments, thus showing preferential treatment. How could he do this, seeing that Jacob's preferential treatment earlier led to brothers hating and selling him? The answer is that Joseph was thus influencing the future for Mordechai, who would wear five royal garments.

However, obvious things are not stated in the Talmud, and instead, we deal with exceptions. If one reads the Megillah in the wrong order of words, verses, or paragraphs, he has not fulfilled the mitzvah. He should read it from a scroll; reciting by heart is also invalid.<br />
<br />
Other things that must be recited in proper sequence are praises (Hallel) and the central part of the daily prayer, "Amidah," or "Eighteen blessings." The Talmud then discusses the reason for each of the eighteen blessings and why each takes its place in the proper order. After these words, one should not praise God on his own, making them an additional part of the Amidah. Why not? Because he indeed cannot enumerate all the praises, and by saying only some of them, he in fact detracts. By right, this argument should apply to the Amidah itself: how can we start praising God, knowing that we won't do it adequately. For this, one has an excuse since the early Sages established this text and required it to be said daily.<br />

There was no Megillah there, so he wrote it from memory and read it. Rabbi Meir was a different kind of human being. The complete Torah was always in front of his inner eye, so it is as if he wrote it by copying from a scroll. And yet, the Sages forbade writing from memory!? - in case of pressing need, it is allowed.</p><p>But what about tefillin and mezuzah that can be written from memory? This seems to contradict the rule? - Tefillin and mezuzah are known by heart by many. The scribe can write them, provided that he is certain.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Jewish scribe. Jozef Israëls</p>

However, sometimes for convenience the Megillah can be read on the eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth. 
<br />
<br />
What is the source for making those "convenience" dates? – But first, what is the meaning of this question? Purim occurred long after the giving of the Torah; what source can there be in the Scriptures for it? – Here is what we mean: it was the Sages who established the fourteenth and the fifteenth as the day of celebration, based on the text of the Megillah itself. These same Sages must have added the provisions of the earlier days. What was their source?
<br />
<br />
Here, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm">To establish these days of Purim in their times</a>," and the words "their times" indicate multiple days. "Their" gives two days, and "times" gives another two days. But we need five days total! That is because the thirteenth is when everybody came together to defend themselves, and it does not require a particular word to be added to the times of reading the Megillah. The Talmud quotes another phrase as the source and explains why these two opposing points of view do not agree.<br />
<br />These dispensations only existed when the Court adequately fixed the years, and the Jews lived in Israel.&nbsp;Later, people were calculating Passover dates as thirty days from Purim. Then they would read the Megillah only on the fourteenth of Adar.&nbsp;For cities that were walled in the times of Yehoshua (such as Jerusalem) – on the fifteenth.

One can either stand or sit; however, one who reads for the congregation always stands.  By contrast, one who reads the Torah scroll, even in private, should accord the Torah more honor by standing.
<br />
<br />
How do we know this rule about reading the Torah? – Because God said to Moses, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=5#P5079">And you, stand here with Me</a>.” In fact, Rabbi Abahu explained it thus: “Were it not that the Torah said it, it would be inappropriate to speak of God in these terms, but it tells us that God, too, was standing while teaching Moses.”  From the word “with me,” we see that the teacher should be not sitting on the couch while the student is on the ground, but instead, they should be on the same level.  Indeed, earlier generations, from Moses till Rabban Gamliel, were standing while learning Torah. Later a general feebleness  descended into the world, and they began learning while sitting. 
<br />
<br />
Even two people people can read the Megillah for the congregation, but with the Torah it has to be only one. Why? – Since people love the Megillah, they will concentrate and hear every word anyway. 
<br />
<br />
Moses established to read the Torah publicly on Saturday and on Mondays and Thursdays. That way, no three days will pass without one hearing the Torah.

Depending on how much time people have, fewer or more readers are called up. For example, only three readers are called on regular weekdays. On Shabbat, seven people read from the Torah because people are free.<br />
<br />
Initially, the first reader would say the opening blessing, and the last one – the closing one. Later, more people started getting in and out of the synagogue during the reading of the Torah. Then the Sages established that everyone who is called up says both blessings. People who attended only a part of the reading could mistakenly think that the reading of the Torah does not need a blessing before or after.
<br />
<br />
Everyone who reads in the Torah should be given at least three phrases. This presents another problem: since the Torah is written in small sections, visually delineated from the rest, they should read at least three phrases from the beginning of each section. Otherwise, those going in might mistakenly conclude that the previous reader got only two phrases. The same applies to the end of the portion. Therefore, how does one divide the section consisting of five phrases? – He reads three from the beginning, and the next reader repeats the last phrase; thus, both read three phrases. Some say that these precautions only apply to people who are going out. Anyone coming in will surely ask, “How come we started two phrases from the beginning? Did the previous reader only get two phrases?”  - and they will explain to him that the reader started from the section before.

Why seven? Some say it is because of seven words in the blessing of the Priests, and others – that it corresponds to seven servants of Achashverosh who "saw his face of the king every day."<br />
<br />
In principle, a woman or a minor can be called to read from the Torah, but the Sages said that it should not be done – because it will reflect negatively on the level of knowledge of the male contingent.
<br />
<br />
Certain events require the presence of a minyan, or ten adult Jewish males. For example, communal prayer (with the prayer leader's repetition of the Amidah) cannot be said when there are less than ten people present. Also, the Kohanim don't say their blessing, and the Torah is not read unless there is a minyan present. 
<br />
<br />
But how do we know that the minyan is exactly ten people? – from the word "among." This word is used in describing the congregation of Korach. It is also used with the congregation of the spies who belittled the  Land of Israel. The spies numbered ten. Further, from "I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel," we see that every sanctification needs a congregation, and this congregation is ten.

What is the source for this rule? For the first part, we get it from Betzalel creating the Tabernacle object, and then Moses, who was on the higher level, putting it together. The "don't bring down" part is learned from the two hundred and fifty people who joined Korach in his revolt: the pans they used to offer the incense were not disposed of but beaten into the covering for the Altar.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.05px;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.05px;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.05px;">What about keeping on the same level? For example, can one sell a synagogue to buy another one? The rule leaves it open, and there are two opinions ("yes" and "no"), but in practice, it is permitted. There are also other considerations with the synagogue: care must be taken to prevent negligence of not buying or building another synagogue later.</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.05px;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.05px;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.05px;">If the people in a village built a synagogue building strictly for themselves, their authorized representatives could sell it in the presence of the place's residents.

Megillah 28 – A synagogue in ruins

One may not eulogize ordinary people there (unless Sages are present, making it a  public eulogy). One may not work there, such as making ropes or nets or spreading fruit on its roof.  One should also not use the synagogue as a shortcut.
<br />
<br />
Why is this? – Because of the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=26#P3553">And I will make your sanctuaries desolate.</a>” Thus, even after desolate, they are still called “your sanctuaries” and retain their rights. If grass sprouts there, one should not uproot it - to inspire grief.
<br />
<br />
Since one cannot enter the synagogue for personal affairs, what is he to do when calling someone out of it? – He should come in and sit down. Then, if he knows certain portions of the Talmud or the Torah, he should recite them. If not, he can ask a child to repeat for him what the child learned today. Thus, he has converted his visit from personal to one for study or for prayer.

However, this is only when there are not enough people to honor the dead. And how many is enough? - Twelve thousand, just as the number of men who went to war with Midian. Others, however, say that it is six hundred thousand: just as the Torah was given to the soul in the presence of six hundred thousand people, it is taken away with six hundred thousand.
<br />
<br />
Abaye said, "Initially, I learned Torah at home and prayed in the synagogue. Once I understood how God loves the synagogue, I learn and pray there." In another place, we have a conflicting statement, which recommends praying in the place of learning. The synagogue is called "a small Temple." In the future, all synagogues and study halls will be transplanted to Israel.
<br />
<br />
Close to Purim, in Adar, there are four unique Torah portions read in the synagogue. Here they are. Half-shekel collection for the Temple - because of its timing next month. The portion of destroying Amalek - because of its connection to Purim. The red heifer - since it was used to purify the people before the Holidays. "This month will be for you to celebrate Passover" - because by then, it is already Passover time.

Since the intent is already clear, what do we learn from each word? - That even the Kohanim and the Levites leave their Temple service and go to listen to the Megillah. We can deduce that the Torah scholars, whose work is not as crucial as the Temple service, certainly close the books and go listen to the Megillah.<br />
<br />
But is this really true, and the Temple service is more important than the study of the Torah? Don't we have <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0605.htm">the story of Joshua</a>, where an angel came to him and said, "You are guilty of two transgressions: yesterday you neglected the daily sacrifice and today – the study of the Torah. However, I came only today because&nbsp; missing the study of the Torah is more important?" So the study of the Torah is more important, and perhaps the Sages should not close their books and go to read the Megillah? There is a difference: the Torah study of Israel is more important than anything else, but the Torah study of an individual gives the right of way to the sacrifices and indeed to the reading of the Megillah.
<br />
<br />
Rava asked a question: both reading the Megillah and burying the unattended corpse are more important than the sacrifices, but of these two, which has precedence? Then Rava himself answered: human dignity overrides even Torah prohibitions,  so burying the unattended corpse is undoubtedly more important than listening to the Megillah.

Logically, one should read about Amalek first, and only then go to fight him. Therefore, they should read about Amalek on the Shabbat before Purim – and that is what Rav says. Shmuel, however, holds that they should read about Amalek in its proper time as it falls out. As far as events being out of order: first do, and then be commanded – Shmuel answers that since there are walled cities, who would celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of the month, for them at least it will come at the same time. 
<br />
<br />
The Talmud continues with the discussion of the multiple possible occurrences of calendar days and Shabbat, Holidays, and the Torah portions read on these occasions. Today, when the calendar is fixed and is not determined by the Court, many of these coincidental occurrences can not happen.

This person takes away the reward of all the previous ones. How could it be? – The Talmud likes to emphasize things. Rather, his reward is equal to all of the previous ones combined. 
<br />
<br />
With all that we said about the Torah on the previous pages, how could God say, “I, too, will give you laws that are not good?” Rabbi Yochanan says that it is talking about someone who is learning, but does not express his joy of learning in singing. However Abaye asked about this, “Just because someone does not know how to sing nicely, he deserves the bad words?” Rather, it is talking about two Sages who live in the same city but do not discuss Torah between them. 
<br />
<br />Moses established a custom to learn the laws of each Festival on or before its time. Where is this in the Torah? In the phrase “And Moses told the laws of the Holidays to all Israel.” It is customary to connect the end of a Tractate with its beginning – and here we can remember that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/07/megillah-2-times-to-read-megillah.html" target="_blank">the beginning of this Tractate discussed when the people should read the Megillah</a> – which obviously requires study in advance.

Some say, it means that they were in danger, and some – that the salvation came through them. 
<br />
<br />
The people living in villages used to hear the Megillah earlier than those living in cities. But what is a city? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, "Any place that does not have ten men always present in the synagogue and learning Torah, and available for prayer - such place is not called a city." But it is a known rule; why repeat it? – To tell us that passers-by through the city don't count.
<br />
<br />
We mentioned that the people who lived in villages can read the Megillah earlier, such as if they come to a city on the day of court assembly, Monday or Thursday. Who does this enactment benefit? Mainly, the people in the cities, because their brethren living in villages supply them with food and will be available for this on the day of Purim; but also partially benefits the villagers, for they won't have to make a second trip, having visited the city before.
<br />
<br />
Why is the Megillah never read on Shabbat? All are obligated to hear it, but not all are experts in reading. Thus, one can take the scroll to the Sage on Shabbat to learn with him and, as a result, carry it in the public area, which is forbidden on Shabbat.  It is also for the benefit of the poor people, who expect food and presents on Purim, and it would be harder to do this on Shabbat.

Megillah 5 – What is a large town?

What is considered a large town? – A place that has “ten idlers.” Some say, these are people supported by the community who study in the synagogue at all times, and others – that they don't have to be supported, as long as they are available for prayer. 
<br />
<br />
By contrast, the commemoration of sad events may be pushed back when required but never forward. For example, if Tisha b'Av occurs on Saturday, it is observed following Sunday.<div><br /></div><div><div>Rabbi Yehudah the Prince did three unusual things: he planted a tree on Purim, bathed on the fast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz, and sought to abolish the fast of Tisha b'Av, but the Sages did not agree to this. Each of his actions is analyzed by the Talmud. For example, how could he do work on Purim? Actually, there is nothing wrong with it, but if the community has the custom to abstain from work on this day (as many communities do nowadays), one should follow. About the tree - Rabbi Yehudah planted a particular tree for a joyous occasion, which is permitted.

Megillah 6 – Should you fight evil?

<br />
<br />
If someone tells you, "I worked on studying Torah but did not succeed," – do not believe him. Also, don't believe if he says, "I did not work on my studies and nevertheless succeeded." However, if he says, "I worked hard, and I succeeded," - believe him because the two go together. That is only true in understanding, but retaining the knowledge is a gift from Heaven. With regards to business, it is all luck and help from Heaven.
<br />
<br />
If you see an evil person with luck on his side – "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2637.htm">do not contend with this wicked man</a>." However, Rabbi Shimon taught just the opposite, that it is permissible to contend with the wicked in this world, following "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2828.htm">Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but the righteous will fight them</a>.” In fact, if someone whispers in your ear the verse of Rabbi Yitzhak about not contending – that is your spirit weakened by your errors, but what it really means – do not try to be like them. 
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it looks like a contradiction!? – Not really! Fight with the wicked in spiritual matters, but allow them to have the things of this world. Or, it could refer even to this world, and "do not fight" applies only when you have luck on his side.

Megillah 7 – One must get inebriated on Purim

It is on this second Adar that Purim must be observed. Some say that it must be on the first Adar. Both derive their opinion from the exact same words in the Megillah, "each and every year." This means "connect the redemption of Purim with Passover and designate the second Adar." Others say it means to do like very year, where Adar follow the previous month of Shvat.
<br />
<br />
Esther of Purim told the Sages, "Record my holiday in the Megillah." The Sages replied that it would be politically incorrect and lead to resentment from the nations over which the Jews were victorious. She replied, "Anyway, this is already recorded in the chronicles of Persia," and they acceded.
<br />
<br />
Here are the ancient proofs that the Book of Esther was written with the prophetic spirit: it knew what "Haman said in his heart," that "Esther found favor in everybody's eyes," and that "nobody took any booty." However, Shmuel later added a proof: "They confirmed and undertook to read the Megillah every year." Who confirmed? – The Heavenly Court. Rava said he can find faults with all ancient proofs, but not with Shmuel's proof. He applied a proverb, "One sharp pepper is better than a bucketful of melons."
<br />
<br />
One must get so drunk on Purim as not to know the difference between the evil Haman and the righteous Mordechai. Rabbah invited Rav Zeira to a Purim feast, and when they were drunk, he slew Rav Zeira. The next day he prayed for mercy, and Rav Zeira came back to life. Next year, though, Rav Zeira declined the invitation, saying, "A miracle does not occur every time."

For other laws – such as reading the four special Torah portions reminding of important events – they are equal. From here on, we have a series of “there is no difference” statements. 
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between the laws of Shabbat and Holidays, except that one is allowed to cook for people's consumption on Holidays.
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur, except that for doing work on Shabbat, one may theoretically be executed, and for the same on Yom Kippur – there is only "being cut off from one's people."
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between a vow prohibiting one all benefit from the other person and a vow prohibiting food benefits – because many things lead to food – except for the permission to pass through his property. 
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between vowing to bring a sacrifice and designating a specific animal, except that when he vows and then buys an animal, and it is lost or dies, he has to buy another one.
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between a zav (see <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">here</a>) who had two emissions and one who had three, but that the latter needs to bring a sacrifice.
<br />
<br />
A metzora (spiritual leper) may be quarantined and declared a definite metzora. There is no difference between the two states, except that the latter also needs to let his hair grow and tear his garments as a sign of grief.

Megillah 9 – There is no difference between mezuzah and other scrolls...

There is no difference between mezuzah and tefillin on one hand and other scrolls on the other &nbsp;– except that mezuzah and tefillin need to be written in Hebrew, while other scrolls (such as prophets) can be written on parchment in any language. 
<br />
<br />
In other places, however, there are different, seemingly contradicting rules. The Talmud distills this as follows: tefillin and mezuzah need to be written in Hebrew, because in their text there is a phrase “these words will be for you,” - that is, they will be as they are in the Torah, without change. Megillah, too, has an instruction, “according to their script and according to their language,” that is, it should not be changed. 
<br />
<br />
Other books can be written in other languages – but Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagrees and allows, among all foreign languages, only Greek. Why Greek? Because of the story of the king Ptolemy, who sequestered seventy-two Sages in seventy-two houses, and commanded them to translate the Torah into Greek. Without communication, they translated word for word, and made occasional emendations in the same places. They changed the name of God from plural into singular, such as instead of “let us make man,” - “let Me make man.” They also changed the “rabbit” into “creature with short legs,” because Ptolemy's wife was called “rabbit,” and the Sages did not want Ptolemy to think that the Jews were mocking him by inserting the name of his wife among non-kosher animals. 
<br />
<br />
Greek also had the distinction of being the most beautiful language. Now that it has become corrupt, one cannot write the Torah in Greek.

Meilah 10 – Offerings That Do Not Have A “Permitter”

For example, for animal sacrifices the “permitter” is the blood of it, when it is thrown on the Altar, and for flour offerings it is a handful of flour that a Kohen takes off of it.
<br />
<br />
As <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/meilah-9-progression-of-bird-burned.html">we just saw</a>, the ”permitter” is what serves as a marker, when the misappropriation laws either begin or end. However, there are sacrifices that have no permitter, either because they themselves are permitters, or because they are completely burned on the Altar. What is their progression, for example, in the case of the handful of flour offering?
<br />
<br />
It becomes subject to misappropriation as soon as the owner says that he consecrates the offering. Once it has been put in a Temple vessel, it achieves complete consecration. Therefore, it is then susceptible to be disqualified, such as if it comes in contact with someone who went to the mikvah to purify himself, but the sun did not set yet; or with one who needs an atonement offering but has not brought it yet; or it was left beyond permitted time.
<br />
<br />
However, unlike most other offerings, wrong intentions do not disqualify a permitter. Why not? Because the law of thought disqualifications (such as planning to eat it after allowed time) were only stated for peace and similar offerings which have a permitter.
<br />

Meilah 11 – When Misappropriation Does Not Apply

This ruling is repeated here, to introduce the laws of misappropriation for such offerings. Once an offering enter this category (such as a sin-offering whose owner died), there is no prohibition of misappropriation for it. Why is that? Since nothing can be done with it, and it is destined to die, it is no longer classified as “holies of the Temple.” Because of that, the prohibition of misappropriation does not apply. However, the Sages prohibited their use, even though they did not impose the restitutions and sacrifices required by the Torah for misappropriation.
<br />
<br />
Another case when misappropriation does not apply is the money of a nazirite. A nazirite may separate money in anticipation of completing his period of being a nazirite, when he will be required to bring offerings. However, one of his sacrifices is a peace offering, to which misappropriation does not apply. Since any coin from his money may in the end go to purchase the peace offering, there is no misappropriation for the whole sum. Nevertheless, it is forbidden to use this money for other purposes, because all sacrifices, even not strict ones, are prohibited for benefit.

Since there was this mitzvah of “separation of ashes,” that continued, there remained a prohibition of misappropriation for the ashes. In contrast to the ashes of this outer Altar, the ashes of the inner Altar, which was used for burning the daily incense, lost the misappropriation prohibition once they were burned. However, they were put on the place where the outer Altar ashes, and after they were mixed, the prohibition of misappropriation was again in force.
<br />
<br />
Bird sacrifices, turtledoves and pigeons, had to be of specific age: turtledoves – older than a year, and pigeons – younger than a year. Therefore, if turtledoves were too young, or pigeons were too old for the sacrifice, there was no prohibition of misappropriation for them. There Sages established a prohibition not to use them, but there are no Torah-imposed penalties if one does.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon disagrees on the last point: turtledoves whose time for a sacrifice has not yet arrived nevertheless have a prohibition of misappropriation: since they eventually will come of age, there is a prohibition of misappropriation even now. This is not true for pigeons older than year, since they will never become younger, but only older.

That is true for actual sacrifices, but something consecrated to the Temple's treasury, which cannot be brought on the Altar itself – like chicken or she-donkey – their eggs and milk are subject to misappropriation prohibition.
<br />
<br />
The offspring of the tithe animal may not be allowed to suckle from its mothers – because the mother is a sacrifices; therefore, others would donate milk for it. The same was true for any consecrated animal. Workers may not eat of the dried figs of the Temple with which they work. Even though normally it is their right to eat fruit while harvesting, and the owner violates a mitzvah if he stops them, it does not apply to the Temple, since the Torah said, “The harvest of your fellow,” not of Temple. Similarly, a cow may not eat what it is threshing for the Temple, but must be muzzled.

Even if we assume that it was built from the twigs that grew after consecration, they may be prohibited, but not with the serious misappropriation laws. If that nest was on top of a tree planted for worship, he should knock it down with a stick, then take it.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish were discussing a different subject, and in doing so elucidated our ruling. If an idol broke on its own, is it permitted for use? Rabbi Yochanan said that no, because only an idol worshiper can nullify an idol. However, Resh Lakish said that yes, because the idol worshiper reasons as follows, “This idol could not save itself, how can it save me?!” - and nullifies it in his heart.
<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish then asked Rabbi Yochanan, “The nest on top of a worshiped tree was made of twigs broken off by birds, so it is the same as an idol that broke on its own, and it is nevertheless permitted!” Rabbi Yochanan replied though that the birds brought the twigs from elsewhere.

Items consecrated to be brought on the Altar combine with one another for misappropriation. For example, if one ate half an olive volume of meat of an animal sacrifice, and another half an olive volume from another, he committed misappropriation, because he ate an olive volume of Temple's property. Additionally, if those half-olive volumes were of  sacrifices left beyond permitted time, and he ate the total volume of an olive, he is liable to be cut off from his spiritual source. Two half-olive volumes of something fit for Temple treasury but not for the Altar also combine. Finally, even meat of a sacrifice and meat consecrated to the Treasury, also combine with one another for prohibition.
<br />
<br />
Actually, the last rule is the biggest unexpected teaching of them all, and it should be sufficient to teach just that, and we would deduce the rest. However, the first part of the rule mentions meat left over, which is specific to sacrifices, and thus had to be taught separately.
<br />
<br />
The five different components of burned offering: meat, forbidden fat, flour, wine, and oil – all combine with one another for form a complete olive volume for &nbsp;misappropriation. The six components of a thanksgiving offering – the five above plus loaves – also combine.

Meilah 16 – How Prohibited Foods Combine

That is, if one ate small amounts of them, but together it was an olive volume, he is liable. The foods are terumah of the Kohen, terumah that the Levi gives to a Kohen, doubtful terumah (also called “demai”, “what is it?”), terumah of the dough (called “challah”), and first fruit – the last two, because they have an additional name of “terumah.”
<br />
<br />
All of the “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>” meats (animals that were not properly slaughtered) combine with one another, and so do all creeping creatures. In commenting on that, Rav said that "nevelah" meat of kosher and non-kosher animals do not combine for the prohibition of eating, because they are prohibited by different phrases in the Torah, and because one prohibition cannot   be superimposed on the previous one. In our cases, a non-kosher animal is already prohibited, and it cannot become more prohibited as “nevelah” - not slaughtered.
<br />
<br />
However, Levi said that they do combine anyway. In principle, Levi agrees that prohibition don't get superimposed, but nevelah is an exception, because of an extra prohibition for it in the Torah.

Their blood and meat combine to form the volume of a lentil, and if one eats this volume, he transgresses a full prohibition. They combine to transmit impurity in the same way.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua stated a general rule: all items that transmits impurity in the same amount (for example, blood and meat of reptiles), and make one impure for the same length of time (one day, until nightfall, in our case), combine. However, if they transmit impurity in different amounts (for example, flesh of a dead human transmits impurity when there is an olive volume of it), or for a different length of time (impurity of a dead human body lasts for seven days) – these items do not combine with one another.

Meilah 18 – Does One Have To Ruin The Temple Property?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihF47VL7XSR3tBKr4iEHPQcltwAU1txS7OGRYuVDUat447JMA2EB4ZMb-y2GzUKV3UOAxeVBqCYYv-6UePlNFsHHlXHu8a5o0K26OsOdIW_S55Up8CobJHKvXQ7bu6zqdwJ_a5tC7QnkQa/s1600/Willem+Kalf+-+Still+Life+with+Chafing+Dish,+Pewter,+Gold,+Silver,+and+Glassware.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihF47VL7XSR3tBKr4iEHPQcltwAU1txS7OGRYuVDUat447JMA2EB4ZMb-y2GzUKV3UOAxeVBqCYYv-6UePlNFsHHlXHu8a5o0K26OsOdIW_S55Up8CobJHKvXQ7bu6zqdwJ_a5tC7QnkQa/s320/Willem+Kalf+-+Still+Life+with+Chafing+Dish,+Pewter,+Gold,+Silver,+and+Glassware.jpg" width="252" /></a>The remaining combinations that the Talmud discusses include pieces of sacrifices brought with wrong intentions, and those left over, meat of reptiles and animals killed without slaughter, items with different levels of ritual impurity, items carried on Shabbat, and foods eaten on Yom Kippur; sometimes they combine, and sometimes they don't.
<br />
<br />
One commits misappropriation of Temple property as soon as he uses it, even if the item itself did not loose anything because of it, and did not suffer deterioration – this is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. However, the Sages make this distinction: if an item does not deteriorate, like a golden vessel, then one commits misappropriation once he uses and derives some benefit, worth at least perutah (small coin). If it does deteriorate, then one is liable if he used up some of it (like a garment), in the amount of a perutah. Actually, Rabbi Akiva only disagrees with the Sages about items that can deteriorate but are normally kept very carefully, such as very expensive garments of fine material, or the middle garments.
<br />
<br />
What is the source for the requirement of using up some of the item? Misappropriation is compared to terumah, kohen's portion, and just as with terumah, one needs to eat and reduce it, to be liable, so too with misappropriation.

Meilah 19 – How Misappropriations Do Not Combine

Also, if he used one article but caused deterioration in another – he is still not liable, since both the amount of benefit and of deterioration must be at least a perutah.
<br />
<br />
Misappropriation cannot be committed twice. For example, if one used a Temple's ax, it became deconsecrated through his action. Now if he or someone else uses it again, they do not commit misappropriation. The exception to this rule are sacrificial animals and Temple vessels: since they cannot be redeemed, they cannot be deconsecrated either, and if people rode on a sacrificial animal one after another, they have all committed misappropriation.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince states a rule: whatever cannot be redeemed is subject to misappropriation after misappropriation. But that is the same as the first teacher!? – Rabbi Yehudah refers to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/03/menachot-21-wooden-blocks-are-also.html">his own opinion that we saw a while back</a>, that if one donates wooden blocks, they are viewed as a sacrifice, and other blocks of wood are needed to burn these ones. Accordingly, donated wood cannot be redeemed, and one who uses it commits misappropriation.

Meilah 2 – What Constitutes Misappropriation

If that property is designated exclusively as “holies of God,” such as a burned offering, which is burned on the Altar completely, or if it is an object or money of the Temple Treasury, and he derived benefit in the amount of at least one prutah (the smallest coin), then he committed misappropriation. He needs to pay the value of the benefit, add one-fifth, and bring a guilt-offering. 
<br />
<br />
That is true if he committed misappropriation unintentionally. If he did it on purpose, no atonement is available, and he only needs to repay what he used. If he damaged Temple property without deriving any benefit, he is not liable to pay anything (the Torah said “your fellow's property,” not “Temple's property.”) However, the Sages obligated him to repay.
<br />
<br />
If one brought a holiest offering in a wrong way, such as in the wrong part of the Courtyard, or with wrong intentions, he again committed misappropriation since the offering was never usable by people. However, if the Kohanim were allowed to eat the sacrifice at some point in time, then it is not designated exclusively for the Temple, and one who uses it does not commit misappropriation.

Meilah 20 – An Agent Who Did As He Was Told

Actually, this is talking about a Temple treasurer, who is authorized to handle Temple's property. Even though lifting normally effects acquisition, his lifting leaves it in the domain of the Temple. If he then gave it to another, he has transgressed, but his fellow has not. The treasurer, by his giving the stone over, removed it from the domain of the Temple, and no further misappropriation will apply. If he built it into his house, he also has not transgressed, until he has lived in the house, deriving the benefit of a perutah (small coin).
<br />
<br />
If an agent misappropriated the property  of the Temple, by following precisely the instruction given him by another, the one who gave the instruction is responsible for misappropriation, but the agent is not. However, if the agent deviates from the instruction, he becomes liable. For example, if one told his agent, “Give my guests meat,” and the agent gave them liver, (and later it was discovered that it was Temple property) the agent has committed misappropriation.
<br />
<br />
If one told his agent, “Give my guests one piece of meat each,” and the agent told them to take two, but they took three – then all of them: the host, his agent, and his guests, have committed misappropriation.

Actually, he is a Temple treasurer, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/meilah-20-agent-who-did-as-he-was-told.html">just like before</a>, and he will commit it when he uses the money. However, if he said, “from an alcove,” and the agent brought money from the bag, then the agent commits misappropriation, since deviated from the instruction.
<br />
<br />
If one sends an agent to a store, unintentionally giving him money of the Temple, but then recalls that it was consecrated money, then, to spare the store-owner the unwitting transgression, he should take his own perutah (small coin) and say, “The perutah of the Temple, wherever it maybe is hereby deconsecrated on upon this perutah.”

Therefore, if the money-changer spent the money, and it was later discovered that it belonged  to the Temple, he is liable for misappropriation. However, if the money was loose, the money-changer may use it, and  if it was the Temple's, it is the depositor who is guilty of misappropriation. The money-changer's main occupation is to deal with money, and it is presumed that he has the permission to use the loose coins deposited with him.
<br />
<br />
If one deposited money with a private householder, whether it was tied or untied, the householder may not use it. Therefore, if the householder spent the money, and it belonged to the Temple, the householder has committed misappropriation.
<br />
<br />
A storekeeper is treated like a private householder. Even though he often gives change, money-changing is not his main occupation – these are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yehudah treats a storekeeper like a money-changer: since he often gives change, it is presumed that he can use loose coins that are deposited with him. Appropriate laws of misappropriation apply to him.

However, if the bird that flew away landed among other pairs, then we have a problem. If the remaining bird is brought, for example, as a burned offering, then its pair, the escapee, becomes a sin offering. This, in turn, makes all the birds in the group that it flew into invalid, and we lose all these offerings.  To prevent this, we declare the remaining bird invalid, which makes the one that flew away also invalid. Thus we have a rule: if a bird flies away but lands with other birds, it is invalid, and makes one bird in the group that it left also invalid.
<br />
<br />
For example, if one woman had a pair of birds, the next – two pairs, and so on, until a woman with seven pairs, and a bird flew from the first woman to the second, from the second to the third, and so on, until the seventh, then each time a bird flies away, it makes one remaining birds in the group it leaves invalid. If a bird then flew back from the seventh to the sixth, from the sixth to the fifth, and so on, until the first, each woman lost two pairs of birds, except the seventh – since for her there was only one bird that flew in and left, not two.

Meilah 24 – Kohen Who Did Not Consult

However, if the Kohen did not consult anybody but simply took all birds from all women and brought all of them as burned offerings, above the red line in the middle of the Altar, exactly half of them are valid – because indeed half of all birds were burned offerings. If he brought all birds as sin-offerings, below the line, again half of them are valid. Finally, if he brought some of them as burned offerings above and some as sin-offerings below, half in the first group and half in the second group are valid.
<br />
<br />
If during her pregnancy a woman promised an additional pair of birds as a voluntary offering, they are burned offerings, and the Kohen who brings the resulting four birds, must make three of them burned offerings, and one – a sin-offering. If the Kohen did not do so, but rather made two of them burned offerings and two – sin-offerings, she has to bring an additional burned offering.
<br />
<br />
If she tries to designate the offerings, in order to correct for errors, and the Kohen keeps making mistakes, she may bring up to seven extra bird pairs. Better she be silent, and this agrees with a popular saying that a live ram has just one voice, but when dead, it has seven uses: shofar, flutes, drums, harps, etc. And in the same vein, simple men, when growing old, have their minds more and more confused, but Sages who study all their lives, the older they grow, the more their mind matures.

Meilah 25 – Kohanim Guarding The Temple (Tamid)

These were chambers elevated above floor of the Temple, and one of them was called “The Hall of Fire.” It was a dome, where large fires were burning throughout the night, because Kohanim had to perform their service barefoot and in only one layer of clothing. Young Kohanim were used for&nbsp;guarding:&nbsp;since they could not yet bring sacrifices, they could therefore afford to be up all night.
<br />
<br />
The Hall of Fire was a large structure, whose interior was encircled with ledges of stone. The heads of the group of Kohanim who were to serve the next day slept on these ledges. The ledges were not sanctified, which allowed sitting and sleeping on them, for otherwise sitting in the Temple is prohibited for everybody except for kings of the Davidian dynasty. Young Kohanim were not accorded this privilege, but slept each with his cushion on the ground. They would not sleep in their holy vestments, but would rather remove them, and fold them under their heads, and cover themselves with their personal garment.
<br />
<br />
If one of them experienced a seminal emission during the night, he would exit the Hall of Fire and proceed through an underground tunnel, where lamps were burning to illuminate his way, until he reached the Immersion Room, where he would immerse himself in a mikveh. A large fire was burning there for people to dry and warm themselves after immersion. There was also a “latrine of dignity,” whose door was closed when someone was there, and thus one never had to speak in it.

Meilah 26 – The First Service of the Day (Tamid)
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

The first service of the day in the Temple was “separation of the ashes.” Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=6#P2857">and he will separate the ash… and place it beside the Altar</a>,” the Kohen would go up on the Altar, scoop a shovelful of ash, then come down, and deposit it to the east of the Altar ramp. Any Kohen who wanted to do this service would wake up early, immerse himself in a mikveh, and be ready before the Kohen appointed over the distribution of services arrives. If more than one Kohen wanted to do the service, they would draw lots.
<br />
<br />
At what time did the appointed Kohen arrive? Sometimes a little before and sometimes a little after the rooster’s cry. He would knock upon the Temple gates, and they would open it for him. He would say to them, “Whoever has immersed himself should come and participate in the lottery.” They made a lottery (we will learn about this in the tractate Yoma), and whoever won, won.

Meilah 27 – Use of Priestly Garments (Tamid)

<br />
<br />The Kohanim did not sleep in their garments to return to the previous subject but rolled them under their heads. Do we see from here that only sleeping in them was prohibited, but daytime use, such as walking in them, was in fact allowed, even when not doing the service? – No, this is no proof. Perhaps daytime use was also prohibited, but the teacher chose to speak about sleep to tell us that the garments should be treated respectfully. If so, how could they put the garments under their heads? – Don’t read “under” but read “next to” their heads.
<br />
<br />
But consider the story of Alexander the Macedonian marching to destroy the Temple at the incitement of the Cutheans. What did Shimon the Righteous, High Priest, do? He donned the priestly garments and went to meet Alexander. They were traveling all night, and at dawn, when Alexander saw the High Priest, he alighted from his horse and bowed down to him. They asked Alexander, "Why are you bowing down to this Jew?" He replied, "I see this image every time I go into battle, and it protects me." Don’t we see from this story that priestly garments can be used for personal needs? – No, we don’t. Perhaps they were garments fit for service, but not actual priestly garments. Or perhaps they were the real garments, but “Time to act for God” is an exception.
<br />
<br />
The conclusion is that priestly garments can be used, but then there is further disagreement about using them even before the service or not taking them off after the service.

Meilah 28 – Temple at the Break of Dawn (Tamid)

The main door would be opened later on in the day. Two groups of Kohanim followed him, and each carried a torch.  Once in the Courtyard, one group walked in the east colonnade and one in the west, checking the vessels as they walked. If all the vessels were in order, they said, “Peace, all is well.”
<br />
<br />
When they met again, they appointed from among their number the makers of the wafers that the High Priest would bring. At that point, one chosen to remove the ash from the Altar would go to his task. They would tell him, “Be careful not to touch the shovel until you sanctify your hands and feet with water” – not because he actually had to, but because, being alone, he might be carried away and start the real service, which would be prohibited. 
<br />
<br />
No one entered with him between the Altar and the Antechamber, and he had no lamp but rather walked in the light of the pyre. They would not see or hear him until he started pulling the vessel out of the mikveh with a wooden wheel, and the other Kohanim would say, “Time to sanctify the hands and feet” and be ready to do it.
<br />
<br />
He would take a silver shovel, ascend to the top of the Altar, and scoop from the most consumed, innermost coals. He would then descend, walk along the northern side, and pile the coals on the floor at a distance of three handbreadths from the ramp.

Then they took the shovels and forks and went on the top of the Altar. There they removed the limbs of the burned offering remaining from the day before, and put to them to the side of the Altar, or on the ramp. They would not remove them altogether, so as not to disqualify them.
<br />
<br />
They would begin piling the ashes on top of the mound, located in the center of the Altar. At times, this mound was like 300 kors in volume (50,000 cubic feet, which is an exaggeration, one of the few found in the Torah, Prophets, and Talmud). On the Festivals, they would not remove it, because it is an adornment for the Altar, but normally they were never lax to remove the ashes out of the city, when the mound became too large.
<br />
<br />
They began bringing up shaven and smooth logs and arranging the pyre toward the east side of the Altar. They would leave spaces between rows of logs and insert small chips there, to start the fire. They also brought fine pieces of fig-tree wood for the second pyre, opposite the Temple Hall door, for coals to burn the incense. Now they would return the leftover limbs to the fire, descend from the Altar, and proceed to the Chamber of Hewn Stone, where they drew lots for the remaining services.

Meilah 3 – If They Did Put An Invalid Offering On The Altar

Basically this applies when the sacrifice was valid when it entered the Courtyard, and the disqualification occurred later, as part of the service.
<br />
<br />
Earlier <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/meilah-2-what-constitutes.html">we learned</a> that if one slaughtered an offering, such as a burned offering, which must be slaughtered to the North of the Altar, in the South, he invalidated it, and that misappropriation still applies in this case. A related questions was asked: if they put limbs of this invalid offering on the Altar, must they keep them there? If we say that an offering slaughtered at night has to be kept on the Altar, then perhaps one slaughtered in the South of the Courtyard is the same way, and it too has to stay on the Altar. Or perhaps on offering slaughtered in the South is worse, and it is as if choked, not slaughtered at all? Rav Yosef and Rabbah argued this matter out, and Rav Yosef found an incontrovertible proof that once it went up on the Altar, it does not go down.

Who throws its blood on the Altar? Who clears the ashes of the Inner Altar? Who clears the ash from the Menorah? Who brings the limbs of the morning offering to the ramp of the Altar?”
<br />
<br />
The Kohanim cast lots by each raising a finger and counting, and one on whom the count would end would get the first service, while the other Kohanim to his right would get the rest. The bringing of the limbs to the ramp, together with libations, required nine Kohanim, and larger sacrifices required more.
<br />
<br />
The appointed Kohen would tell them, “Go out and see if the time for slaughtering the morning offering has arrived.” If it had, the observer says, “Dawn!” To prevent a possible error, they restate, “Has the entire eastern sky lit up?” and the observer says, “Yes!”
<br />
<br />
The would go and bring a lamb from the Chamber of the Lambs, and give it to drink from a golden up. The would offer it, and proceed with the other services. Some of the sounds of the Temple were heard as far as Jericho.

Meilah 31 – The Order Of The Morning Sacrifice (Tamid)

However, it would be disgraceful for the morning lamb sacrifice, so instead they bound it in the manner of the binding of Isaac: the right foreleg with the right back leg, and the left foreleg with the left back leg, except that in the case of Isaac his hands and feet were bound behind his back.
<br />
<br />
There were multiple rings in the floor of the Temple, between the Altar and the Temple Hall, because the slaughter had to be done “in front of God,” which meant opposite the Hall entrance. Each group of the Kohanim had a ring assigned to them, and each group served for a week about two times a year. However, for the morning sacrifice all groups used the same ring, near the northwest corner of the Altar, because the sacrifice had to be slaughtered in a sunlit area. The daily afternoon sacrifice was slaughtered, correspondingly, using the ring in the northeast corner.
<br />
<br />
The ring itself was used to immobilize the sacrifice before slaughter. The sheep was positioned with its head pointing to the south, its face to the west, while the slaughterer was to the east of the sheep, with his face to the west. They would hang the lamb using a hole in its knee, not like the butchers who break its leg, then they would skin, dismember, wash, and salt the lamb, and carry the pieces to the Altar.

He said, “Which distance is greater, from heaven to earth, or from east to to west?” The question was of a spiritual nature, concerning the two types of Divine Providence for the righteous, but nevertheless it had to be clothed in physical matters. They answered, “From east to west is greater, since people can see the sun in the east and in the west, but not when it is directly above.”
<br />
<br />
He asked, “Were the heavens created first, or the earth?” They answered, “The heavens,” based on the verse, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” He then asked “What was created first, light or darkness?” They said, “This matter has no resolution.” But let them respond that darkness was created first, based on the verse, “And darkness was upon the face of the earth, and God created light!” They did not want to give him the answer, lest he continues exploring what was before the Creation. If so, they should not have answered the first question either! At first they thought that he was asking about the plain meaning of the verses in the Torah, but when they saw that he was intent on knowing the mysteries also, they stopped there. He also asked many questions about proper conduct in life, and an advice in war.

At the command of the appointed Kohen, they would say the blessing before the “Shema Israel” prayer, the one that deals with the study of the Torah, then the Ten Commandments, then the Shema itself, then the blessing for the Divine acceptance of the Temple service, and then the blessing of the Kohanim for the people. Then they went back to the service.
<br />
<br />
The appointed Kohen told them, “Those who are new to the incense service, come and draw lots”  – since this service was conducive to riches. After that, all of the Kohanim would draw lots for bringing the sacrificial limbs to the fire (these limbs were previously left on the ramp). Some say that six Kohanim won that, and some say that it was one Kohen. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov says that the same Kohanim who put the limbs on the ramp now carried them to the fire.<br />
<br />
The non-selected Kohanim would return their holy garments and dress into their own. Those who continued the service brought the incense and the limbs, and then one of them threw a specially designated shovel on the floor, whose sound signaled for the Kohanim to go prostrate in the Hall, the Levites to start singing, and Kohanim who became impure to stand at the eastern entrance, either to preclude suspicion of eschewing the service, or to shame them into being more careful in the future.

<br />
<br />
The Kohanim stood honorary guard in three places in the Temple, and the Levites – in twenty-one more places. The Officer of the Temple Mount would make rounds to each and every guard, with torches lit before him. The Levite guards, being posted on the Temple Mount rather than in the Courtyard, had the permission to sit there, but it was expected that they would rise to their feet, when they perceived the light of the torches. If they did not stand, the Officer would tell them, “Peace unto you,” to preclude the possibility that the guard was too absorbed in his thoughts. If it was apparent that the guide was sleeping, the Officer had the right to strike him with his staff, or even burn his outer garment.
<br />
<br />
The walls surrounding the Temple Mount had five gateways, each with its own name and function. The Temple Courtyard, too, was enclosed by walls on all four sides, and there were seven major gateways that &nbsp;led to the Courtyard. The Hall of Fire – where, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/meila-25-kohanim-guarding-temple-tamid.html">as we have described, slept the Kohanim during the night</a> – had four chambers that opened into it, like suites that open into a ballroom. Two of them were in the consecrated portion – The Chamber of Sacrificial Lambs, and the Chamber of the Vision Bread, and two in the unconsecrated part – in one they hid the pieces of the Altar defiled by idol worship, and the other one led to the Immersion Room.

Meilah 35 – A Trip To The Temple (Middot)

Most chambers there were in the south, and most people would enter from the south. They would then turn to the right and circle around to their destination, because of the rule that all turns that one takes should be to the right. 
<br />
<br />
The exception to this rule were mourners and people excommunicated by the court. They would turn to the left, and immediately evoke the compassion of the onlookers, who would say to the mourners, “May the One Who dwells in this House console you.” If he told them that he was excommunicated, they would say to him, “May the One Who dwells in this House instill compassion in the judges' hearts,” - these are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yehudah said to him, “You have made the judges out as if they overstepped the bounds of the law.” Rather, they said to him, “May the One Who dwells in this House put reason into your heart, and you listen to the words of your colleagues.”
<br />
<br />
Inside the Temple Mount wall was a lattice-work fence. At one point in history there were thirteen breaches in it, made by the Greek kings. Later these were repaired, and the Sages instituted thirteen prostrations corresponding to them.
<br />
<br />
Further inside the Temple were the Women's Courtyard with the balcony, Israelite's Courtyard, the Courtyard of the Kohanim, the Altar, and the Temple proper.

It was constructed by bringing a wooden base of that size, one amah high, and filling it with the mixture of lime, molten lead, and tar. After the mixture hardened and the wooden frame was removed, the remaining structure formed "the base" of the Altar.
<br />
<br />
The second form was thirty by thirty amot, and it was five amot (about 8 feet) high. It was filled with the same mixture.
<br />
<br />
The third tier was twenty-eight by twenty-eight amot, and had the height of three amot. On it corners there were protrusions, called “horns,” and the outside of it formed a shelf, known as “the ledge,” which could be used for walking. A ramp led up the Altar from its south side. It was as long as Altar itself, and its width was half that.
<br />
<br />
Both the stones of the Altar and of the ramp were quarried from the valley of Bait Kerem. They would dig beneath virgin soil and bring from there whole stones that were never touched by iron. Since iron renders the stones, and consequently the whole Altar, unfit by simply touching them, they went to great length to find stones that were unlikely to have been touched by iron. The Altar was protected by a layer coat of lime, and it was only wiped by web cloth.

It had an entrance of twenty amot high (about 30 feet), and 10 amot wide. This entrance had four doors, two on the outside, and two on the inside of the entranceway. Additionally, the main gate had a smaller door to the south and another one to the north. The one to the south, no man ever entered through it, because, as Ezekiel said, “only God, the Lord of Israel, comes through it; it shall be closed.” 
<br />
<br />
Inside the Sanctuary, there were thirty-eight cells (small rooms), arranged in three stories, and they were used to store gold, silver, and other valuable articles owned by the Temple.
<br />
<br />
The special chamber was the Chamber of Hewn Stone, where the Great Sanhedrin would sit. It was partially inside the Courtyard, where the Kohanim would come with their questions and stand, and the other half of it was outside the Courtyard, where the Sages would sit and judge. A Kohen in whom a disqualification was found would wrap his head in black, leave the chamber and go. And the Kohen in whom no disqualification was found would clothe himself in white, enter the Courtyard, and serve with this brethren the Kohanim. Those in whom no disqualification was found would make a day of celebration, and they would proclaim, “Blessed is the Omnipresent, Who Chose Aaron and his sons to stand an serve before God in the chamber of the Holy of Holies.”

Meilah 4 – Wrong Intention And Misappropriation

<br />
<br />
Strict offering, once consecrated, belongs completely to God, and one should not use it. If one does, he commits misappropriation. After it is slaughtered and its blood is thrown on the Altar, the Kohanim eat portions of it, and misappropriation does not apply. By contrast, lighter holy offering belong to God and man, and there is no problem of misappropriation for it. Once it is slaughtered and its blood is thrown, some of its parts go on the Altar, and there is misappropriation for them.
<br />
<br />
In short, throwing the blood of strict offerings removes the law of misappropriation, but throwing the blood of the offering of lighter holiness brings about the law of misappropriation. All this is true if service was done correctly. If the Kohen had wrong intentions, either to eat the meat later than allowed, or to eat it in the wrong place, throwing the blood does not have the usual effect – so said Rav Gidel in the name of Rav. The Talmud shows multiple disproofs, then multiple proofs for his statement, and does not find a decisive one.

Meilah 5 – Which Step In The Service Permits Misappropriation?

That is easy to understand: if Kohanim had any right in it, then it does not belong solely to God, and the strict laws of misappropriation do not apply any longer. On the other hand, if something went wrong in the sacrificial service, and the meat was not allowed for the Kohanim even for a moment, the laws of misappropriation still apply. Rabbi Yehoshua gave examples of both: if the service was complete, but the meat was left over, became impure, or was taken outside the Temple, the laws of misappropriation do not apply; but if a Kohen had wrong intentions during service, the prohibitions remain.
<br />
<br />
At which exact moment is the law of misappropriation removed? Bar Kappara said to Bar Padda, “Please ask about the moment of permissibility in the study hall tomorrow, and be ready to discuss the question. Did Rabbi Yehoshuah mean the moment of slaughter, the moment of throwing the blood, or the moment when it can be eaten?” On the next day, Chizkiyah said that it was the moment of slaughter, and Rabbi Yochanan said that it was the moment of eating. In discussing this, the Talmud has to modify its understanding of many rules, and the discussion itself continued through the ages.

Meilah 6 – The Meat Was Taken Outside

We can understand Rabbi Eliezer: this meat has to be eaten inside the Courtyard. If it is taken out before its blood is thrown, it can never be eaten, and throwing its blood later does not help. Thus, it belongs solely to God, the Kohanim do not have any portion in it, and the laws of misappropriation still apply.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Akiva says that these laws don't apply any longer. The meat itself is good and kosher, and only its current location prevents the Kohanim from eating it. Therefore, throwing its blood on the Altar removes the prohibition of misappropriation.
<br />
<br />
As a corollary, they also disagree whether the laws of wrong intentions, left-overs, and ritual impurity apply, in the sense that one gets cut off from his spiritual source for eating the meat.
<br />
<br />
To prove his point, Rabbi Akiva compares the case to a situation where one had a sin-offering, lost it, designated another one, and slaughtered one of them in the Courtyard. The remaining one is similar to meat that is outside the Courtyard, and just as the remaining sin-offering does not have the prohibition of misappropriation, since the sin was atoned for, so too, in our case the meat taken out is not subject to misappropriation.

In the case of stricter offerings (such as burned offering) it can work either way, but in the case of less strict offerings (peace offering), it always makes the law more stringent. How so?
<br />
<br />
Let's take the case of strict offerings first. Before the Kohanim throw the blood, the offering is completely forbidden, and the law of misappropriation applies to both sacrificial parts and the edible meat. Once the blood is thrown, the meat is permitted, and now there is no misappropriation for it, even though it still applies to the other parts of the sacrifice.
<br />
<br />
In the case of less strict offerings, the throwing of the blood affects all of their parts stringently. Before the Kohanim throw the blood on the Altar, there is no misappropriation for a peace offering, because it does not belong exclusively to God. However, after throwing, the parts that go on the Altar become completely dedicated to the Altar alone, and there is a prohibition of misappropriation for them.

As soon as one verbally consecrates it as such, it becomes completely forbidden for any other use, and thus the laws of misappropriation begin. After it is slaughtered, and its blood &nbsp;is applied to the Altar, no parts of it are burned on the Altar, but edible parts are eaten by the Kohanim. Naturally, since its meat is permitted to the Kohanim, the laws of misappropriation cease to apply.
<br />
<br />
The slaughter of birds is done completely differently than that of animals: the bird's neck is pierced with a thumbnail from the back of the neck. This process is called “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/zevachim-20-shechitah-and-melikah-of.html">melikah</a>.” After the melikah is done, the bird becomes susceptible to be disqualified, such as if it comes in contact with someone who went to the mikvah to purify himself, but the sun did not set it; or with one who needs an atonement offering but has not brought it yet; or it was left beyond permitted time. Its last service is sprinkling of its blood on the Altar. At this time, the wrong intention disqualifies it. If the intentions were right, but one ate it beyond its time or while being impure, becomes liable to being cut off from his spiritual source.

Its service consists of only two steps: slaughter to the back of the neck, called “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/zevachim-20-shechitah-and-melikah-of.html">melikah</a>,” and squeezing of its blood on the Altar. Unlike sin-offering, it is missing the step of sprinkling the blood. After its crop with feathers is removed, it is completely burned on the Altar.
<br />
<br />
The bird becomes consecrated with an oral declaration, after which it is subject to the laws of misappropriation. Once it is killed through melikah, it can be disqualified in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/meilah-7-progression-of-bird-sin.html">same ways as a sin-offering</a>, and after its blood is squeezed on the Altar, one becomes liable if he eats eat at the wrong time, in a wrong place, or if the Kohen had the wrong intentions when doing the service. Since it never becomes permitted for consumption, it has the prohibition of misappropriation until it is burned to ashes on the Altar, and is transported to the place of ashes outside Jerusalem. At this point its mitzvah is completed, and there is no misappropriation anymore.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud describes similar progressions for animal offerings, and delineates when the prohibition of misappropriation starts and stops for them.

<br />
How do we know that? Rabbi Zeira explained. The verse states, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/9-17.htm">He brought near the flour offering and filled his palm from it</a>.” From here we do not yet know whether it is his right or his left palm. However, when it says regarding a metzorah (spiritual leper), “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/14-15.htm">The Kohen will take from the oil and pour on the Kohen's left palm</a>” - we understand that the Torah had to specify “left” in this case, but in all other cases, when not specified, “palm” means right palm. Therefore, Kemitzah, taking off a handful of flour, must be done with the right palm.<br />
<br />
They asked Rabbi Zeira, “but the word 'left' is need to teach the law of metzorah itself!?” He answered that there is another time that “left” is mentioned. They asked again, “but learn from here that palm is always left!” He answered that there is a third “left” mentioned, teaching that only metzorah needs the left palm.<br />

Menachot 100 – Replacing the Bread of Vision

Four more priest preceded them to remove the bread. The ones with the new bread stood in the north, which is more holy, and as the other ones pulled the bread from the table, the new bread was placed on it, hand-breadth by hand-breadth, to fulfill the obligation of the bread being “<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/25-30.htm">before Me, continuously</a>.”<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose says that even if the priests removed the bread in the morning, and the other priests would put it on in the evening, this too is called “continuously.” They exited the Sanctuary, burned the frankincense, and apportioned the bread among the priest, who would eat it.<br />
<br />
From the words of Rabbi Yose we learn that if one learns a little Torah in the morning and a little in the evening, he fulfills “<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/1-8.htm">the Torah shall not depart from your mouth</a>,” and even if he just reads the “Sh'ma,” but we don't tell this to the unlearned. Rava said, “It is a mitzvah to tell it to them.”<br />
<br />
What could be the five reasons why it is a mitzvah to tell it to them? - Your suggestions are welcome.<br />

Menachot 101 – Which Offerings May be Redeemed
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgflIVfVG7jOWYMO09Nmg2_arNeO6kT46DzhVBW9MC8CSkYxbXaQe1kCbJpiE04FWRhyphenhyphenhEGnHzzBaaBcPAFWE98de3H-hrxo_Tq7iEp4vHS5seBJ8I4k0j1teviTJYcQLBH7WGHtV2DrKY/s1600/Gustave+Caillebotte+-+Game+Birds+And+Lemons.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="206" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgflIVfVG7jOWYMO09Nmg2_arNeO6kT46DzhVBW9MC8CSkYxbXaQe1kCbJpiE04FWRhyphenhyphenhEGnHzzBaaBcPAFWE98de3H-hrxo_Tq7iEp4vHS5seBJ8I4k0j1teviTJYcQLBH7WGHtV2DrKY/s320/Gustave+Caillebotte+-+Game+Birds+And+Lemons.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If an animal offering became blemished, it may be redeemed, that is, exchanged for money. After redemption, the money becomes sanctified and has to be used for the same purpose as the animal was designated for, and the animal can be used. The law about the redemption of animals is <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/27-11.htm">stated in the Torah</a>, but what other offerings can be similarly redeemed?<br />
<br />
The flour offering and the libation that became ritually impure can be redeemed, provided that they have only been designated for that purpose, but not put in a Temple vessel. Before they are  put in the Temple vessel, they possess only monetary sanctity, and that is why the redemption is possible. Once they have been put in a vessel, the vessel sanctifies them with the physical sanctity, now inherent in them, and after that redemption is impossible.<br />
<br />
Bird offerings, the wood used to fuel the Altar's fire, the frankincense and the vessels themselves can never be redeemed, even if they become ritually impure. That is because these objects attain physical sanctity immediately upon consecration, and completely miss the stage of monetary sanctity, at which redemption would be possible.<br />

Menachot 102 – Everything That Stands To Be Redeemed Can Be Considered Redeemed
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglelLXsQi3eIbVZOSNY8Keuy2a-zGSP7r-jNG_-9vZgibmdXDv0kFhbY4DabTtx3JvZ-ZP3avx1ioKcLmjUDxQy1vVQ2qmm-j2X_UEc9YtaUJ4enCauQFo-IV253262u47iPOyp5nnn2Y/s1600/Giuseppe+de+Nittis+-+The+Rain+Of+Ashes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglelLXsQi3eIbVZOSNY8Keuy2a-zGSP7r-jNG_-9vZgibmdXDv0kFhbY4DabTtx3JvZ-ZP3avx1ioKcLmjUDxQy1vVQ2qmm-j2X_UEc9YtaUJ4enCauQFo-IV253262u47iPOyp5nnn2Y/s320/Giuseppe+de+Nittis+-+The+Rain+Of+Ashes.jpg" width="219" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">This way of looking at things is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. For example, the Red Heifer was slaughtered in a designated place on the Mount of Olives, facing the portals of the Temple. It was then burned in a pit, and its ashes used for purification from the ritual impurity of the dead.<br />
<br />
In this procedure, there is not a moment when its meat can be eaten. However, since there is a time period when it can be redeemed, that is, after slaughter and before its blood is sprinkled, Rabbi Shimon considers it legally as if it had been redeemed, and therefore could have been eaten, with the result that it is now subject to the laws of food contamination.<br />
<br />
The principle of “all that stands to...” reappears in various areas. For example, according to Rabbi Shimon, the blood that stands to be thrown can be considered as if thrown. On a more practical level, the debts that stand to be collected by the court can be considered as if collected, with the result that the court can treat monetary obligations transferable as real money.<br />

Menachot 103 – Flour Offering Obligations and Mistakes

He has not fulfilled his obligation and has to bring another offering, but the one he brought is valid. We regard it as another free-will offering. <br />
<br />
However, if he pointed at the flour and said, “This flour is designated to be brought as an offering on a griddle,” and instead he made one in a deep pan, his offering is completely invalid. Why is this difference? In the first case, he created a personal obligation, but he was free to bring another additional offering. In the second case of flour designation, the flour acquired the sanctity of a specific type of offering, and this cannot be changed.<br />
<br />
If one promises a flour offering of barley, he nevertheless has to bring one of wheat. His starting words, “flour offering” are considered decisive, and the conclusion “of barley” - which is meaningless, because there are no personal barley offerings – is disregarded.<br />

Menachot 104 – Largest Flour Offering of 60 Tenths

This amount can be put in one vessel and brought as one offering. If he wants to bring more, he needs to divide it into two offerings. <br />
<br />
Everybody agrees to this rule, but they argue about the reason for it. One opinion says that since the largest flour offering that a congregation can bring, which happened on the first day of Sukkot if it fell on Shabbat, amounted to 61 tenths, then an individual cannot exceed that. Rabbi Shimon argues and says that the sixty-one seah of the congregation were all different offerings and not mixed, so that we cannot learn from it. Rather, sixty tenths can be properly mixed with oil, while more than that cannot. They asked him, how can the measure be so precise? There should be a little give and take! He answered that all measures of the Sages are that way, for example, a mikvah of forty seah is valid, a little less than that is not.<br />

A poor man. I consider it as if he offered his soul.” Why are there five different ways to cook the flour offering? This is similar to a king whom his poor friend invited for a meal, and the king said, “Make many types of flour dishes, and I will enjoy them.”<br />
<br />
If one promises a “tenth” of an ephah, he should bring one “tenth”, if he promises “tenths,” he should bring two, but if he says, “I specified the size but forgot,” he needs to bring the largest possible offering, 60 tenths, or about 300 pounds. In this last case, he states, “The amount that I promised in my vow is found within these 60 tenths and it goes for the fulfillment of my vow, and the rest I am bringing as a free-will offering.”<br />

However, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that he needs to bring every possible offering between 1 and 60 tenths. Altogether one brings 1830 tenths, which can be calculated by pairing the numbers, 1+60, 2+59, and so on, 30 times (Tosafot). Every toddler mathematician invents this formula, and Gauss did it when his teacher told him to sum up the numbers from 1 to 100.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? When one brings a large offering and says, “part of it is my obligation, and the rest is a free will offering,” he is mixing the two in one vessel, but aaccording to Rabbi Yehudah, mixing obligatory and voluntary offering is not allowed. Alternatively, according to the Sages, he does not consecrate the remainder, and mixing unconsecrated and consecrated items is allowed. However, Rabbi Yehudah argues that then he would be bringing the unconsecrated items into the Courtyard, which is prohibited on its own.<br />

If he promises to bring frankincense, he brings at least a handful.

If he promised wine, he must bring no less than three measures called “log,” or about one-and-a-half liter, because this was the smallest amount brought with any of the sacrifices, that is, with a lamb.

They do not argue in principle, but in the place where one lived lambs were cheaper, and where Rabbi Elazar lived, birds were less expensive.<br />
<br />
One who says, “I specified to bring a peace or a thanksgiving offering but do not recall which,” brings a bull and a cow, a male calf and a female calf, a ram and a ewe, a he-goat and a she-goat, a male kid and  a female kid, and a male lamb and a female lamb.<br />
<br />
If one promised a specific ox as a burned offering and the ox became blemished, his obligation disappears. Unlike the previous cases, he promised a specific animal and not a sacrifice in general, and once this animal cannot be brought as a sacrifice, he is free from his obligation. He still needs to redeem the ox, and the money then acquires holiness and has to be used for a burned offering, but he can buy greater or smaller animals with it.<br />

What is the story of the temple of Chonyo? When the Righteous High Priest Shimon died after eighty years of service, he appointed his son Chonyo as his successor. Chonyo's brother Shimi plotted to remove him: he tricked him to serve in his wife's clothes and told the priests that Chonyo did this out of love for his wife. Chonyo ran away and built his own temple. The Sages did not touch Shimi, to prevent him from acting even worse in pursuit of honor. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the story was the opposite: Chonyo plotted against Shimi, was discovered, and ran away.<br />

Menachot 11 – Too Much Oil

The Kohen would extend his three middle fingers, scoop the flour in them, and close the fingers over the palm of his hand. In the case of flour offerings that were first baked and crumbled into pieces, he would use his thumb and his pinky to break off the protruding pieces.<br />
<br />
If he increased its oil or diminished its oil, or if he diminished its frankincense, it was invalid.<br />
<br />
What does it mean that “he increased its oil?” As Rabbi Elazar explained, that means that he designated two logs (log=.5 liter) instead of 1 log for the standard 5-pound amount. But why did not Rabbi Elazar explain it as adding unsanctified oil? Rabbi Elazar stated his ruling in the form of “I don't have to tell you,” namely, “I don't have to tell you that if he added unsactified oil that he made it invalid, since that oil is not fitting, but even if he added too much fitting oil, he still made it invalid.” What forced Rabbi Elazar to interpret it this way? - The wording itself, “its oil.” <br />

<br />
However, if the priest intends to burn the frankincense the next day, then Rabbi Yose disagrees and say that the offering does not bear the penalty of being cut off. They asked Rabbi Yose, “What is the difference between that and an animal sacrifice?” He answered, “With an animal, its blood, meat, and sacrificial parts are one unit, but the frankincense is not a part of the flour offering itself.”<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish explained that Rabbi Yose's reasoning is a bit more complex. The handful of flour permits the sacrifice, and the frankincense also permits the sacrifice, and one permitter cannot not ruin another permitter. And the Sages? They agree that one permitter does not ruin another permitter – but only if they are in separate places. In the case of the flour offering, however, the flour, oil, and frankincense are all in the same vessel and are considered as one.<br />

Shavuot offering consisted of two loaves of wheat accompanies by two lambs. The loaves and the lambs were waved, and later eaten by the kohanim. The Bread of Vision consisted of twelve breads, arranged in two stacks of six breads each, with a spoonful of frankincense of top of each arrangement.<br />
<br />
If one slaughtered the two lambs of Shavuot with the intention to eat one of the loaves the next day, or if he burned the two spoonfuls of frankincense with the intention to eat one of the Bread of Vision arrangements the next day – then Rabbi Yose says that only the loaves that he intended to eat at the wrong time become rejected and bring about being cutoff from the people, but the Sages says that the complete offerings become rejected.<br />
<br />
If you wanted, Rabbi Yose offers logic as proof, and if you want – a verse. Logic: rejection is no better than contamination, and one limb of an offering can becomes contaminated without the second. Verse: “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-18.htm">and the soul that eats of it bears his sin</a>,” - of IT, but not of the second half.<br />

Rabbi Yehudah says that it should be burned, because it does not have its companion part, but the Sages maintain that only the invalid part is burned in a special place designated as “the place of burning,” but the remaining pure part can be eaten.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? He has a tradition from his teachers that communal flour offerings, such as two loaves of Shavuot and the Bread of Vision, which is arranged in two piles,  must be treated as a single unit. Thus, if part of it has been invalidated, none of it is valid.<br />
<br />
A thanksgiving offering was accompanied by 40 loaves of bread. The celebrant would invite as many guest as he could, since the loaves had to be eaten that night. The wrong intent to eat the animal thanksgiving sacrifice beyond this time time makes the loaves rejected, but the wrong intent about the loaves does not make the sacrifice rejected.<br />

If the kohen had the wrong intent to eat the meat of the sacrifice beyond allotted time, then if the libations were already in a Temple vessel, they too became rejected – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Once the libations are put in a vessel, they become an integral part of the sacrifice. The Sages, however, disagree, since libations for a sacrifice can be brought many days after the sacrifice itself is brought.<br />
<br />
The flour sacrifice has a two-part “permitter”: the handful taken from it, and the frankincense. Both need to be burned on the Altar. If one intended to consume the flour at the wrong time when he was burning one of the permitters - either the handful or the frankincense – the whole offering becomes rejected, and one who eats it deserves to be cut off from the people. This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, and it can be summarized as “there is rejection with half of the permitter.” But the Sages disagree  and say that it is not rejected unless he had the wrong intent for both.<br />

If one wants to eat it instead, beyond permitted time, the offering remains valid. Actually, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/03/menachot-12-wrong-intentions-for-flour.html">we learned it before on page 12</a>, and it is mentioned here only to introduce the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who declares it invalid.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? Burning on the Altar and eating is described by the same term “achilah,” or consumption, as in the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-18.htm">if some of the meat of the peace-offering will be consumed at all</a>,” literally, “consumed, will be consumed.” Thus we see that the two are equated, and if one intends to eat what should be burned on the Altar or to burn what should be eaten by men, and plans to do it at the wrong time, the offering becomes rejected.<br />
<br />
What do the Sages say to this? They agree that consumption by the Altar is called eating, but only to make the thought of the kohen effective, whether he said “I will burn it on the Altar” or “I will make the Altar eat it” - but not to equate it with human consumption.<br />

This repeated in the morning, but in the afternoon he added “but Rabbi Eliezer makes it invalid.” At this Yosef's face lit up and he explained that finally after years of searching he found the source for what his teacher taught him. Rabbi Elazar cried with joy and applied to Yosef “<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/119-97.htm">How I love your Torah, all day it is my conversation</a>.”<br />
<br />
The proper flour offering is prepared as follows: some oil is put in the vessel, then flour and more oil is added and everything is mixed, then more oil is poured on top, some types are baked into 10 breads and are broken into  pieces by folding them over many times,  some types are waved, and the handful is salted before burning it on the Altar. If he omitted any of these steps, the offering is still valid, provided that the right amounts were used. The last oil pouring is essential.<br />

<br />
In regard to flour offering, Rav gave an additional rule: any time that the Torah repeated a specific law about flour offerings, it did so to emphasize that it is required. For example, the Torah repeated the requirements of finely ground flour and oil to show that they cannot be omitted. Shmuel disagrees on that. But how could Shmuel disagree with the rule that repetition means a requirement? - Actually, they argue about one point only, the requirement to use one's hand for the handful. It is stated about Aharon and is repeated for the future. Rav says that this is valid repetition, but Shmuel states that we cannot learn new laws from the one-time happening  with Aharon.<br />

The minimum amount for it is 43.2 egg volumes, or between 2.5 and 4.3 liters, about one 5-pound bag of flour. A flour offering generally contains oil in the amount of one log, or six egg volumes, about half a liter.<br />
<br />
Flour offerings have four steps in their service, paralleling those of animal offerings. First a kohen takes off a handful of flour, parallel to cutting the animal's throat. Then he puts this handful in a service vessel – similar to receiving the blood. Then he carries the handful to the Altar – similar to carrying the animal's blood to the Altar. Then he burns the handful on the Altar, and the remaining flour is used for the consumption by the kohanim.<br />
<br />
There are many different types of flour offerings. If a kohen took the handful not for the sake of the right offering, it is still valid and its service needs to be completed, but it does not count toward the owner's obligation, so the owner must bring another one. The exceptions are the offerings for a sin and that of a suspected wife, which become completely invalid because of a wrong intent.<br />
