But consider the salt: any flour offering must be salted before the handful is brought, and the salt requirement is not repeated in the Torah. In mathematical logic we could answer that repetition means that it is essential, but that it can be essential even without repetition. However, in teaching the Torah this answer does not work, because such teaching would be confusing to the students. Even though Rav stated only one side of the requirement, he really meant “if and only if.”<br />
<br />
One answer is that according to Rav salting is indeed not essential and can be omitted. Or, if you wish, we can answer that since the word “covenant” is written with regard to salt, it is as if the requirement has in fact been repeated.<br />

Menachot 21 – Wooden Blocks are Also Sacrifices

The minimum in this case would be two blocks, and their dimensions are one by one cubit. Since it is a sacrifice, it requires two more blocks of wood to burn it, like any other sacrifice. <br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah derives this opinion from the words “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-1.htm">flour offering sacrifice</a>.” Since flour offering is already a sacrifice, this means some other offering, namely wood. Moreover, just like flour, wood offering needs to be salted. And, just like flour, one needs to take off a handful. For this, one needs to chip away at it, until a handful is collected.<br />
<br />
The salt was stored in the Temple in three places: in the chamber of salt – for the hides, on the ramp – for the limbs, and at the top of the Altar – because there they would salt the handful of flour, its frankincense, and the incense.  <br />

Menachot 22 – Using Communal Wood, Mixing Handfuls

For you might think that he needs to bring his own wood, just as he brings his own libations. To dispel this notion, the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-8.htm">On the wood that is on the fire that is on the Altar</a>.” &nbsp;Just as the Altar comes from the communal funds, so too the fire and the wood.<br />
<br />
If the handful of flour from one offering became mixed with the handful from another offering, or with the flour offering of a regular kohen, or with the daily offering of the High Priest, they are all still valid and can be burned on the Altar. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees with regard to the High Priest's offering, which contains three times as much oil. Since it is loose like batter, it will mix with our less oily handful and nullify it.<br />
<br />
But Rabbi Yehudah's own opinion everywhere in the Talmud is that like substances never nullify each other, so how can he rule differently here? He will answer that our case is different: we view the oil in our handful as if not present, and then the oil in the High Priest's offering nullifies our flour.<br />

If one can take off a handful from one, making sure that no flour from the other offering is mixed in, the offerings will still be valid.<br />
<br />
If a handful became mixed with another flour offering, from which a handful has not been taken yet, then nothing can be done about it. One cannot burn the mixture because of the flour of the other offering mixed it, since only the handful can be burned. Neither can one take two handfuls. If the kohen went ahead and burned it on the Altar anyway, it counts for the owner of the first offering, but not for the owner of the second offering, into which the handful fell.<br />
<br />
The same is true when a handful from an offering fell into the remnants of the other offering: the mixture should not be burned, but if one did burn it on the Altar, this counts for the owner of the handful.<br />

The rule is that a vessel combines the parts, but is it true even for impurity? Rav Kahana gave an answer from the wording of the rule, which does not state that it joins the halves, but only that it combines. This means that they are not joined for impurity.<br />
<br />
If a zav (one with strong impurity) was lying on a sheet, the sheet acquired his strong impurity. If the owner then made this sheet into a curtain, on which no one can lie, then the previous strong impurity leaves, but since the sheet touches itself (every thread in it touches another thread), then it has the lighter impurity of being touched by a zav. However, Rabbi Yose asked, “Which zav touched it?” - Rabbi Yose means that a thread touching another thread means nothing, because this is hidden impurity, which does not count. <br />

It had the power to effect acceptance for an offering that became ritually impure. <br />
<br />
If the handful from a flour offering became ritually impure, and the kohen nevertheless offered it, the head-plate of the High Priest effects acceptance. However, this is only true for ritual impurity. If the handful was taken out of the Temple Courtyard and then brought back and offered, the head-plate does not effect acceptance, for the rule is that the tzitz effects acceptance for an offering that became disqualified due it its being impure, but not due to its having left the confines of the Courtyard. <br />
<br />
How do we know this rule? The Torah stated regarding the head-plate, “<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/28-38.htm">So that Aaron shall bear the sin of the sacred offerings</a>.” Now, which specific sin does it mean? About the intention to eat it in the wrong place the Torah already said “it will not be considered,” and about the intention to eat it beyond allowed time, it said, “It will not be accepted.” The only one left for the head-plate to correct is being ritually impure.<br />

What happens if the remainder becomes impure before they have a chance to burn the handful? This is actually the same argument as the one about the Passover lamb offering, where the question was, can one throw the blood if the meat became impure. Rabbi Eliezer, who allows the blood of the Passover lamb to be thrown, would allow the handful of flour to be burned. And Rabbi Yehoshua, who does not allow the blood of the Passover offering to be thrown, would not allow the handful of the flour to be burned.<br />
<br />
The handful of the flour offering was to be put into a service vessel first. If this was not done, the offering was invalid. Rabbi Shimon, however, rules it valid. What is his reason? According to Rabbi Shimon, since the flour offering had to be put into a vessel before service anyway, that was sufficient. <br />

As a general rule, nothing is essential, unless stated otherwise. The Torah can indicate that a requirement is essential by either repeating it, or by using the word “thus,” or the word “a decree” when describing it.<br />
<br />
All parts of the flour offering are essential, so that if a smaller part of the flour is missing, the larger part is invalid. The same is true if the wine, oil, and handful of the offering. In addition, the handful and the frankincense are essential for each other.<br />

The two goats of Yom Kuppor are essential to each other, that is, if one is absent, the other one is of no avail. This is also true for the two lambs of Shavuot, the two loaves of Shavuot, the two arrangement of the Bread of Vision, the three components of the Red Cow service, the four breads of a thanksgiving offering, the four parts of the lulav, and the seven sprinkling of the Red Cow.<br />

Menachot 28 – The Menorah

The seven lamps on top of the Menorah are essential to one another. <br />
<br />
The two passages written in the mezuzah scroll are essential to one another, and even the proper writing of one letter is essential to the validity of both passages. In describing the mezuzah, that Torah says, “and you will write these words” (ktavtam) which can also be understood as “ktav-tam,” “perfect writing,” meaning that every letter should be perfect. <br />
<br />
The Menorah was to be produced from a single block of raw material, and it would be made of gold. If the craftsman made it out of scraps of gold, the Menorah is invalid.  In describing the Menorah, the Torah said that it must be “hammered out.” An additional word “being” indicates that this requirement is essential. However, if the Menorah was made of other kinds of metals, then it did not have to made out of one piece, and was nevertheless valid.<br />

When Moses ascended to Heaven, he found God sitting and attaching crowns to letters of the Torah. Moses said, “Master of the Universe, what stops You from giving the Torah without crowns?” God replied, “There is one man, Rabbi Akiva, who will expound heaps of laws based on each crown.” Moses was transported to the Academy of Rabbi Akiva, but could not understand his exposition, because Moses was used to know laws through revelation, without proofs. He became worried, but when Rabbi Akiva showed the students the Torah derivation rules he used, Moses' mind was at rest. “Give the Torah through him!” - said Moses to God. “No. Thus it came up in my thought,” - said God. “Then show me his reward,” - said Moses. God showed him how Rabbi Akiva was torn with iron combs and his body was sold in butcher shops. “This is the Torah and this is the reward?!” - said Moses. “Quiet! Thus it came up in my thought,” - said God.<br />

This ruling, however, does not accord with Rabbi Shimon, who says that the action of one who brings the flour openly manifest its type, and the wrong intention does not matter at all. For example, if this offering was already baked on a griddle, this determines its type. In this the flour offering is different from an animal, where the slaughter is the same for all types of sacrifices. <br />
<br />
Throughout the Talmud, Rabbi Shimon analyzes the reasons for the Torah commandments. Based on this analysis, he re-interprets the laws. For example, the law here is that the wrong intention should invalidate the flour offering. However, logic dictates that if from the offering itself it is clear what type it is, then the wrong intent should not matter – and that is how Rabbi Shimon rules.<br />

With his lines, he must go all the way to the bottom of the column, shortening the width of each successive line if needed. <br />
<br />
Every Jewish man must write a Torah scroll during his lifetime. One who buys it fulfills the commandment, but not in the optimal way. If he bought the scroll and corrected even one letter, it is counted as if he wrote it.<br />
<br />
Each piece of the parchment on which the scroll is written must contain between 3 and 8 columns. The margin at the bottom of each column must be a hand-breadth, and at the top – three finger-breadths. However, he must not reduce the size of the script to preserve the margins, but keep it uniform and beautiful, even if the margin becomes slightly narrower because of it. <br />

If, however, it extends three lines into the writing, he should not sew it; rather, he should replace the entire sheet. And that which we said that three lines should not be sewn is only true of an old parchment, but with the new parchment it is not a problem. “Old” does not mean literally old, but one that was treated with gallnut juice, and “new” means one not treated with gallnut juice. Some explain it to mean the opposite: a “new” parchment is one treated with gallnut juice, for this makes the parchment strong, and the seam will hold. If one remembers that gallnut juice is a prerequisite for a Torah scroll anyway, the explanation becomes even more complex.<br />
<br />
Sewing the tear should be done with sinews, the same material used for sewing the sheets together, and not with threads. The custom, however, is to sew with silk threads, which leads to further study and to the interpretation of the above rule in a different way.<br />

Some take it to mean at the end of the line, so that “heaven” appears directly over “earth,” to indicate that your days be prolonged like the height of heaven over the earth. Others say that it means at the beginning of the line, so that “earth” is as far as possible away from “heaven,” to indicate that the days of your life be prolonged like the heaven is far from the earth.<br />
<br />
If a Torah scroll wore out it may not be made into a mezuzah by cutting out the two required paragraphs, sewing them, and affixing them to the doorpost, because we may not lower objects in sanctity but only bring them up. So lowering in sanctity is the only problem, but if not for that, we could? What about the requirement to write the mezuzah on the outer, tougher part of the skin? - That is only the preferred procedure. <br />
<br />
In addition, mezuzah requires scoring with thin lines before writing, and it does not have to be copied from a text, because everyone knows it by heart.<br />

Some say that the danger is being without the mezuzah protection, and some – that he may bang his head against it. However, the servants of the king Munbaz, who were always traveling, would put the mezuzah that way, to remind themselves of the commandment.<br />
<br />
If one affixed the mezuzah to the doorpost like a bolt, that is, horizontally, it is invalid. That is the explanation of Rashi. Rabbeinu Tam, however, says that it would be unseemly for the mezuzah to be upright, since the Torah in the Ark was lying down, and he explains “like a bolt” as vertical, thus invalidating a vertical position.  Tosafot say that the Talmud here alludes to three positions, one of them being like a letter L, and that this one is valid both according to Rashi and to Rabbeinu Tam.<br />
<br />
The study hall of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince did not have a mezuzah. According to Rashi, it was another door, but the study hall does require a mezuzah; according to Tosafot, it does not, and the custom is to affix it without a blessing.<br />

However, we learn otherwise by comparing this writing to the writing of the divorce document, Get, which should be “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">on a scroll</a>,” and this teaches us that  the mezuzah is written on a scroll, and is then affixed to the doorpost. <br />
<br />
But perhaps we should rather compare it to the writing of the words of the Torah on the stones, as the <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/27-3.htm">Jews did when on their entry to Israel</a>?  - We prefer to compare writing that applies in all generations (mezuzah) to writing that applies in all generations (Get), and not to writing which only happened once.<br />
<br />
A better derivation is from the words “and you will write” (uchtavtam) themselves, which can be translated as “complete writing” - that is, on the scroll, and not on the stones. Now that we have this direct derivation, what do we need the previous one for? - You might still think to engrave the words on a stone, then attach the stone to the doorpost. This teaches otherwise.<br />

However, Rabbi Akiva says that this derivation is not needed. Rather, the word for tefillin (totafot) itself hints at the number four, since “tot” means “two” in the Cafti language, and “fot” means “two” in the Afriki language.<br />
<br />
You might think to make four separate compartments out of four separate pieces of hide. However, the Torah said that it will be “remembrance” - one remembrance, and not two or three. How do we reconcile this? We take a piece of hide and shape it into four connected compartments. Then we take one scroll and write the four required passages from the Torah on it, and bend them and insert them in such a way that each passage goes into its own compartment. <br />
<br />
However, the tefillin that goes on the arm, about which the Torah says “it will be a sign for you,” consists of one compartment, with the scroll containing four passages.<br />

If one rose earlier than that, to go out on the road, and did not want to carry the tefillin in his hands, lest they become lost, he can don them immediately. When the prescribed time comes – that is, when he is able to recognize a friend at a distance of four steps – he should touch them and then recite the blessing. <br />
<br />
The latest time to wear tefillin is when the sun sets. Rabbi Yakov says that one may leave the tefillin on until people have stopped walking the streets and no one can longer see him any longer. The Sages say that he may wear it until the time he decides to go to sleep. There a few possibilities to explain this argument: that the Torah prohibited wearing tefillin after sunset, that the Sages prohibited this out of concern for people falling asleep in their tefillin, or that no such prohibitions exist.<br />
<br />
The rulings above apply mostly to the earlier times, when people wore tefillin all day. Nowadays they wear the tefillin only during the morning prayer.<br />

Tosafot say that one who is completely missing his left arm does not wear the tefillin at all, one who is missing the lower portion of his left arm dons tefillin on his stump, and one who is missing the lower portion of the right arm is considered a lefty and dons tefillin on his right stump.<br />

About a left-handed person, some say that he dons tefillin on his right arm, which is his weaker one, but others claim that since most people are right-handed, he too dons tefillin like them, that is, on his left arm.<br />
<br />
Plimo asked Rabbi Yehudah the Prince a question, “One with two heads, on which of them does he don tefillin?” Rabbi Yehudah was indignant. At this moment a man came in and said, “A child with two heads was born to my wife. How much money do I need to pay to a kohen to redeem the child?”  Elijah the Prophet came and gave an answer: “Ten coins, twice the amount, since the Torah counted people by the head.”<br />

For many centuries, this dye was unavailable because the identity of the chilazon was forgotten. However, if the tzitzit (ritual fringes) is made completely of white strings, it is still valid.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />
The tzitzit should be made of two white threads and two blue threads, knotted together. If one made them of only blue threads, and omitted the white, this is also valid.<br />
<br />
What if the threads are so thick that they cannot be tied in a slipknot, but they are long enough that had they been thin, they could have been tied in a slipknot? Said Rav Acha the son of Rava to Rav Ashi, “Certainly they are valid, for when the threads are thick, their fulfillment of the commandment is even more noticeable.”<br />

Menachot 39 – Forbidden Mixture of Wool and Linen is Allowed in Tzitzit

However, the woolen blue strings in tzitzit can be attached to a linen garment. How do we know this?<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “You shall not wear shaatnez, wool and linen together. [But] You shall make yourself braided fringes on the four corners of your garments.” This teaches that although shaatnez is forbidden, in tzitzit it is allowed. Moreover, one cannot say that the linen and wool are simply put together, because the tzitzit must have at least one double knot, which makes it permanently attached, and thus part to the garment. <br />
<br />
The braiding should be done with no less than seven loops, to remind one of the seven heavens, and no more than thirteen loops, to correspond to the seven heavens and the six spaces between them.<br />
<br />
All four-cornered garments require tzitzit. Rav Nachman exempts the silk garments. But we learned that they too require tzitzit?! - Says Rav Nachman, “By the decree of the Sages, to make it look good.”<br />

What is the reason of the Sages?<br />
<br />
The flour of a sin offering can be simply compared to the animal sin-offering. Just as the animal sin-offering becomes invalid with the wrong intent – and <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/11/zevachim-2-for-sake-of-mitzvah.html">this was the first rule in the laws of animal sacrifices</a> - so too the flour of the sin-offering. However, what can be said of the flour of jealousy? - Both are connected to “iniquity.” About the flour of jealousies it says, “reminder of iniquity,”  and about the sin-offering it is written, “and it He gave to you to gain forgiveness for the iniquity.” Thus, by the method of “the same word,” or “gezeirah shavah” we can say that the flour of jealousies becomes completely invalid if the kohen takes a handful of it to be burned for the sake of another offering.<br />

However, this is only the opinion of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai, who do not derive conclusions from the proximity of phrases, consequently do not allow Shaatnez in the tzitzit.<br />
<br />
But practically, anybody who would put a blue woolen thread in his linen tzitzit, aroused astonishment in Jerusalem of old. Jerusalem was the place of especially pious people, and they did not use the Beit Hillel's permission. Why not? Must be that in practice Beit Hillel also forbade this.<br />
<br />
Why would Beit Hillel forbid what they said was allowed by the Torah? Could it be because of the ignorant people who would not know the difference? Then let ten individuals wear it in the manner it is allowed! - All the more they will be astonished. Then let's teach them! - That would work, so the reason must be different. Talmud continues to look for the reason, and you are invited to submit your guesses.<br />

Menachot 41 – Opinion of an Angel about Tzitzit

Rabbah bar Huna prefers the second, so that even unworn garment already requires tzitzit.<br />
<br />
However, a Heavenly angel disagrees, for once an angel encountered Rav Ketina wearing a linen garment without a blue thread in tzitzit - following the opinion that this is not needed. Angel said, “Ketina, Ketina, since you wear linen in the summer and a woolen cloak  with rounded corners in the winter, what will become of the mitzvah to have a tzitzit with blue threads?” Rav Ketina said to him, “Do you then punish for failure to fulfill a positive commandment?”  The angel said, “At the time of anger, yes.” <br />
<br />
From here we see that the angel considers tzitzit to be an obligation of  a person, for why would he punish a person for the obligation of  a garment?! - Not necessarily! He just told Rav Ketina that he was using loopholes to get out of the obligation.<br />

If one made the tzitzit first, before the garment became obligated in tzitit, he would be wearing the tzitzit that was already made from before, not the one that he attached to the garment, and so it would be invalid. For example, if the garment tore, and he sewed it back with a woolen thread, then changed his mind and decided to use the thread as tzitzit, it would not be valid.<br />
<br />
Can one unfasten the tzitzit on one garment and put it on another one? Rav says “no,” but Shmuel says “yes,” and this is one of the cases where Shmuel wins. We can even put the new tzitzit on the garment which already has the old ones, and this does not contradict the rule of “make but do not use already made ones” above, since in this case the removal of the old tzitzit is part of the making of the new ones.<br />

He also said a blessing every morning when donning his own four-cornered cloak. <br />
<br />
These two practices appear contradictory. If Rav Yehudah thinks that women have to wear tzitzit - and we know that women have to do only the commandments whose time is not fixed  - then he must also think that tzitzit has no fixed time and applies both by day and by night. Why did he then say a blessing every morning? - Rav Yehudah recited a blessing every time he donned a garment, much like tefillin. Then let him say it more often! - True, but Rav Yehudah was modest and never undressed during the day, so that changing his night garment was the only time he could say a blessing.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon, however, does not require women to wear tzitzit. Since the Torah says “you will see them (tzitzit)” this applies only during the day. And what do his opponents say? - Some say that “them” means other commandments, some - that it means all commandments, and some - that it means "it" - God's presence.<br />

<br />
There was a man careful about tzitzit but lax in other matters. When he heard about a harlot that took 400 golden dinars as her fee, he sent her the money and came to her house. She had six silver beds and one of gold, and she proceeded to the top one, naked. He wanted to follow her, but his tzitzit started pelting him on the face.<br />
<br />
He went back down, and she descended to him. “What's wrong with me?” - she asked. He answered, “I never saw a more beautiful woman than you. But our God gave us the commandment of tzitzit and mentioned His name there twice, one for reward and one for punishment.”<br />
<br />
She asked his name and his teacher's name. Then she paid one third of all her money to the nobles, as bribes, and as an excuse for not having them as clients anymore. Another third she gave to the poor, to protect her on the way, and the rest she took, together with her bedding, and came to the man's teacher, Rabbi Chiya, to convert. “Maybe you want to marry one of my students,” - said Rabbi Chiya, and then I cannot convert you. However, she explained the story, and he converted her. Then he said, “Now you can go and marry the student who came to your home.” She did so, and that bedding that she spread illicitly she now arranged in the allowed way.<br />
<br />
“If that is the reward in this world, then I don't even know how great it will be in the next one,” - concludes Rabbi Nathan.<br />

It would have been concealed, if not for Chanina ben Chizkiyah who who brought 300 barrels of oil up to his upper chamber and worked there until he explained all the difficult verses. For example, it says, “<a href="http://bible.cc/ezekiel/44-31.htm">Any animal that was not properly slaughtered or that was sick the priests should not eat</a>.” Are we to understand that regular Jews are allowed this? - No! Rather, the kohanim, since they eat birds slaughtered by <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">melikah</a>, may be thought to be allowed to eat other non-kosher meat, and Ezekiel prohibits that.<br />
<br />
Wheat bread and two lambs were brought on Shavuot. If there was no bread, the lambs could not be brought, but if there were no lambs, the bread could be brought without them – these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas said that the reverse is true – since Jews brought the lambs in the wilderness, when they brought no bread, which had to come from Israel. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai says that the law is like ben Nannas, but not because of his reason, and the final law is still like Rabbi Akiva.<br />

However, all agree that once they are connected, they become indispensable to each other, and if either loaves or lambs are lost, the other cannot be brought. What constitutes the “connection?” Surely the slaughter of the lambs does, but what about waving them together, which happens before the slaughter?<br />
<br />
Maybe the answer can be deduced from the following law of a thanksgiving offering. If one of the forty breads of the thanksgiving offering broke and it happened before the slaughter of the animal, the owner brings another whole loaf instead. However, if a loaf broke after slaughter, they continue as if it were a peace offering, which does not require bread altogether, but the bread may not be eaten, and the owner has not discharged his obligation. How can they do it?!? If slaughter creates attachment, they cannot proceed with the sacrifice! This would answer our question above that waving, not slaughter, creates an attachment!<br />
<br />
No! No proof can be brought from a thanksgiving offering, since it is called a peace offering from the outset.<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbpsfPssliE2cYqbCFA7GPWoAPLN1YLQKDonD9bqUzgfp-QjrMWngDP_GSR5necLsnO5GBkMAphZYWx66Xe-Cflwn-mdXSj8DX9RQgGtVmh7_YHVPJ7fTtx4IE6k209nTZAy3KUa0egSc/s1600/Eug%25C3%25A8ne+Verboeckhoven+-+Ewe+With+Two+Lamb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbpsfPssliE2cYqbCFA7GPWoAPLN1YLQKDonD9bqUzgfp-QjrMWngDP_GSR5necLsnO5GBkMAphZYWx66Xe-Cflwn-mdXSj8DX9RQgGtVmh7_YHVPJ7fTtx4IE6k209nTZAy3KUa0egSc/s320/Eug%25C3%25A8ne+Verboeckhoven+-+Ewe+With+Two+Lamb.jpg" width="233" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If the two lambs of Shavuot were slaughtered but then the bread that goes with them was lost, what can be done to allow their consumption? The problem is this: if now they throw the blood, then, since the bread is lost, the lambs cannot be eaten and must be burned. However, could the priests throw their blood for the sake of a peace offering - which does not require bread - and then eat them as peace offerings?<br />
<br />
Rabbi Zeira answered, can there be a thing that is invalid if done right, and valid if not done right? Talmud: the Passover offering before midday is exactly this case: it is not valid as a Passover but valid as a peace offering. <br />
<br />
Rabbi Zeira clarified his objection: do you ever find something that was at one time fit if offered for its own sake, like these lambs before the bread was lost, then was rejected – like the lambs because the bread was lost, and is invalid for its own sake, but is valid if offered not for its own sake? Talmud: why, the Passover offering on the other days of the year is exactly that!<br />
<br />
The discussion continues with no decisive victory.<br />

Menachot 48 – Do We Tell a Person, “Transgress in Order to Gain?”
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKwsrhBBay9lmbUH04BmPslDqEUtjQdumZNrGj1Y0EDVOHPnkG61JIu9VeLjcLoVrBe-VPx5epjWgyqZgycuzJw3BZHdfhHyrbpsZWz8uPC48_XwoM3ji_lEDbi8iwlA36R9qReAOtF1A/s1600/Eug%25C3%25A8ne+Boudin+-+Still+Life+With+A+Leg+Of+Lamb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="190" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKwsrhBBay9lmbUH04BmPslDqEUtjQdumZNrGj1Y0EDVOHPnkG61JIu9VeLjcLoVrBe-VPx5epjWgyqZgycuzJw3BZHdfhHyrbpsZWz8uPC48_XwoM3ji_lEDbi8iwlA36R9qReAOtF1A/s320/Eug%25C3%25A8ne+Boudin+-+Still+Life+With+A+Leg+Of+Lamb.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If, instead of two lambs, the kohen slaughtered four lambs for two loaves, he still has a way out. He can throw the blood of the two lambs for their own sake, and of the other two – not for their sake, but as peace offerings. However, he must do it in a specific order. He must first throw the blood of two lambs not for their sake, and only then throw the blood of the two remaining Shavuot lambs. For if you first throw the blood of the Shavuot offerings, you have ruined the remaining two lambs, following the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/04/menachot-47-how-to-allow-lambs-to-be.html">objections of Rabbi Zeira that we learned before</a>.<br />
<br />
Said Rabbi Yochanan to this, “Do we then tell the priest to transgress in order to gain?” Throwing the blood not for its sake is forbidden by a negative commandment, so how can we tell him to do this, even if in the end he gets to eat lamb? The Talmud answers that in this case we do indeed say this, because the result is the saving of the sacrifice from destruction, not just priests eating meat. However, the discussion continues with finer and finer distinctions.<br />

Menachot 49 – Are Regular or Shabbat Offerings More Important?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF5wgKwu_WaebtE5AZw9Ls5HeTJGdu4afZh7JxFRiF99uE5X2M38aIfnxl0MZSIJGiR-P_SMn-FJF7g9hUUX3n37rM1wWjnJQfMeZvuYRsedWmZCRbtMYSURU7NgYcC_nwGkuD60vmyLs/s1600/Carl+Kronberger+-+A+Portrait+Of+A+Woman+With+A+Book+Of+Prayer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF5wgKwu_WaebtE5AZw9Ls5HeTJGdu4afZh7JxFRiF99uE5X2M38aIfnxl0MZSIJGiR-P_SMn-FJF7g9hUUX3n37rM1wWjnJQfMeZvuYRsedWmZCRbtMYSURU7NgYcC_nwGkuD60vmyLs/s320/Carl+Kronberger+-+A+Portrait+Of+A+Woman+With+A+Book+Of+Prayer.jpg" width="241" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The daily offerings are not essential – that is, do not preclude – the Shabbat offerings, and the Shabbat offerings are not essential to the daily offerings. <br />
<br />
Rav Chiya bar Avin asked a question: if the congregation does not have enough animals for both the daily offering and the additional Mussaf offerings for Shabbat or a Holiday, which one of them takes precedence? What exactly is his question? If you will say that it is about the regular and additional offerings on the same day, then it cannot be correct – for daily offerings are clearly more frequent and they are also holy, so of course they come first. It must be that he asked about the additional offerings of today and the daily offerings of tomorrow. But that seems to be exactly the rule above, which must be talking about the same circumstance, where there is not enough animals! - Not necessarily. Perhaps the “non essential” rule above applies when they had enough animals, and it says that if they reversed the order, it is still valid. But it does not answer Ravi Chiya's question about not having enough animals.<br />
<br />
Practically, if one says the Mussaf prayer before the morning prayer on Shabbat, it is valid.<br />

Menachot 5 – Offering of New Grain With Wrong Intent

On the second day of Passover, they would bring barley flour offering, and then all new grain was permitted.<br />
<br />
What happens if a kohen takes off a handful of this barley sacrifice thinking that it is some other offering? Resh Lakish says that is valid, and the handful can be burned on the Altar, but he has to bring another barley offering. How could he say that? If a new offering is required, that means that the first one was invalid. How can one bring it on the Altar?<br />
<br />
You may say that since this very day the new offering will be brought, the offering done with the wrong intent is “as if” valid. But if  you say this, you will have to allow many other invalid actions “as if” valid. It turns out that Resh Lakish does not consider the barley offering a requirement, but only as a good advice.<br />
<br />
Rava disagrees and says that the barley offering always remains valid. Being made of barley, it is not considered a regular offering, and thus the wrong intention does not hurt it.<br />

<br />
He should not bring the flour in two halves, but rather verbally consecrate and bring the full issaron to the Temple in the morning, and then divide it. If a High Priest offered half an issaron in the morning and then died, and they appointed another one in his place that very day, the new High Priest should not bring half an issaron from his house, nor can he use the second half of the flour of the first priest. Rather, he brings a full issaron, divides it in half, then brings half of it in the afternoon, and the second half is destroyed. We thus find that two halves are offered and two halves are destroyed.<br />

Under normal circumstances, he pays for them and brings them. Who pays for them now? Rabbi Shimon says: “They are brought from the public funds.” Rabbi Yehudah says, “The funds come from his heirs, and in that case the offering was brought whole, not in two halves.”<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-14.htm">The next high priest from his (Aaron's) sons will bring it (the offering)</a>,” and Rabbi Yehudah takes the words “from his sons” to also mean our case, where the funds come from his sons. Furthermore, the word “it” means that in this case the offering is brought whole.<br />
<br />
And what is the logic of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states, “eternal law,” literally, the “world law.” Since any commandment is by its nature eternal, then we have an additional meaning that the offering comes  “from the world,” that is, from the congregation.<br />

Those that consisted of dough had to be offered as matzah, or unleavened bread. The Torah specifically said that each flour offering must be “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-4.htm">without leaven</a>.”<br />
<br />
The two exceptions to this rule were the two loaves of Shavuot and the thanksgiving offering. The two loaves of Shavuot were completely leavened; they were made of wheat, ground into fine flour. The thanksgiving offering was accompanied by forty loaves, ten of which had to be leavened.<br />
<br />
The loaves that had to be leaved presented a special problem. Ordinarily one adds some sourdough to hasten the leavening process. In case of sacrifices, the measure had to be exact, and additional sourdough would make it invalid. Rabbi Meir suggests to take out some flour, allow it to leaven, then return it to the offering. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees, since leavening in this case would not be perfect. Rather, one has to put in sourdough and then add flour to complete the measure. The Sages, however, say that in that way too the offering would be either deficient or excessive, because the water in the sourdough would distort the measurements.<br />

If he is a scholar who achieved his knowledge by himself – great! And if he was assisted by the merit of his fathers – also great! Let him come in.”<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ezra came in depressed, probably because of the response of Rabbi Preida, who then began to console him with homilies and asked a question. What does it mean when David says to God, “<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/16-2.htm">You are my Master, my gratitude is not to You</a>” ? - It is a condensed dialog. The Congregation of Israel said to God, “Master of the Universe! Show me the gratitude that I have made Your name known in the world.” God replied, “My gratitude is not to you. I show gratitude only to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were the first to make Me know, but you relied on promises and miracles. <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/16-3.htm">They are the mighty ones</a>!”<br />
<br />
When Rabbi Ezra heard the word “mighty,” he started his own homily and asked, what does it mean, “let the mighty come and exact retribution on behalf of the mighty from the mighty in the mighty?” - Let the Holy One, Blessed is He, exact retribution on behalf of the Children of Israel from Egyptians in the mighty waters.<br />
<br />
When the Temple was destroyed, God found Abraham standing there and asked “What is my beloved doing in my Temple?” Abraham said, “I have come concerning my children.” God said, “You children sinned and were therefore exiled.” Abraham said “Perhaps they &nbsp;sinned inadvertently?” God answered, “She carries out her deliberate schemes.” Abraham said, “Perhaps only a minority of them sinned.” God said, “The majority.” Abraham said “You should have remembered the covenant of circumcision.” God replied, “They violated it and rejoiced.” Abraham put his hands on his head and wept, “Maybe, Heaven forbid, there is no remedy for them?”  The Heavenly voice responded to him, “Just as an olive tree, its destiny is fulfilled at its end, so the Children of Israel, their destiny is fulfilled at their end.”<br />

Any amount of food can become ritually impure, but to transmit the impurity further it must have at least an egg's volume. However, what does “as they are” mean?  <br />
<br />
For example, what would be the law for the calf's meat that swelled to an egg's volume, or for the meat of an old animal that shrank? Rav, Rabbi Chiya, and Rabbi Yochanan say that “as they are” means “as they are now,” but Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon son of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, and Resh Lakish say that it means “as they were initially.”<br />
<br />
Actually, if the food volume was initially less than an egg, then by the Torah law it cannot convey impurity. However, it could be that to avoid confusion the Sages declared it impure once it swelled. The argument is about the existence of this additional precautionary decree of the Sages.<br />

Had they used scalding hot water, the offerings would become invalid, and had they used cold water, the dough would be clumpy. Now, however, since they used lukewarm water for best quality, they had to take special care that the dough does not become leavened, and the Kohen would have to continually work the dough to forestall its leavening, for the rule is that all the time that one keeps kneading the dough, it does not leaven.<br />
<br />
Even if the remnants of the offering - which are not burned on the Altar but are eaten by the Kohanim - become leavened, one transgresses a negative commandment. Furthermore, one is liable to lashes for working with the leavened offering, whether he it is kneading, shaping, or baking.<br />
<br />
The Torah gave a general rule, “Any flour offering shall not be prepared leavened.” Therefore, I would think that there is only one set of punishment for any specific work. Then the Torah stated an exception, “shall not be baked (leavened).” Baking was already included in the rule, so why is it excepted? To make one liable for each individual act. Thus the exception proves, or rather explains, the rule.<br />

If it develops a permanent blemish, it belongs to the owner for consumption, but it is forbidden to make a blemish on purpose. If an animal is sick and the only remedy is to let blood, then there are four opinions on the permissibility of it. Rabbi Meir allows blood-letting, provided that this is done in a place where it does not cause a permanent blemish. The Sages allow to make a blemish, but not to slaughter based on it. Rabbi Shimon allows even to slaughter it, and Rabbi Yehudah absolutely forbids to led blood, even if the animal will die if left untreated.<br />
<br />
The question here is adding a blemish to an already blemished – by being sick - animal. There are two similar situations where everyone agrees that it is forbidden. If one bakes a leavened flour offering, he is adding to leavening, and is thus liable. If one further castrates a male animal, adding to an existing castration, he is liable. In the case of a firstborn, the strict rulings are based on the Torah verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/22-21.htm">there shall be no blemish</a>,” and the lenient ones – on “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/22-21.htm">it shall be unblemished to find favor</a>,” meaning that if it is already blemished - then it does not find favor.<br />

Menachot 57 – Why Flour Offering Should Not Leaven
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHuVizBGPjALj0sT7Y0ZrZov064k-dKHO7plUgWw073eKy5-arkpoVZkz8KLJffhQZbVWj54cgFOaIx5kOFf3DlJ7IUgwOZv8pwgNZ_yvkEmKzlSkI9dRiKJrvl_oNUl2r7Xi5axZ1b-Y/s1600/Woman+Baking+Bread++-+Jean+Francois+Millet+-+Woman+Baking+Bread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHuVizBGPjALj0sT7Y0ZrZov064k-dKHO7plUgWw073eKy5-arkpoVZkz8KLJffhQZbVWj54cgFOaIx5kOFf3DlJ7IUgwOZv8pwgNZ_yvkEmKzlSkI9dRiKJrvl_oNUl2r7Xi5axZ1b-Y/s320/Woman+Baking+Bread++-+Jean+Francois+Millet+-+Woman+Baking+Bread.jpg" width="266" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Had the Torah stated only “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-11.htm">that you offer to God shall not be prepared leaven</a>,” I would say that this applies only to the handful burned on the Altar. But since the Torah added “flour offering,” this tells me that the whole offering should not be allowed to rise. And, since it also added “any flour offering,” I know to apply this law to all the various flour offerings. Furthermore, since the Torah continued “That you offer to God,” it tells me that one violates a prohibition only with a valid offering, but not if it became invalidated.<br />
<br />
Rav Pappa inquired, “If a flour offering leavened, was taken outside the Courtyard, then returned, then the priest baked it and thus leavened it some more, is he liable for the second leavening?” Do we say that that he is not liable, because it has been invalidated by being taken out, or do we say that it had been invalidated by the first leavening, and then taking it out has no effect, and he is liable for the second leavening? To this there was no answer.<br />

It had to repeat the word “any.” Ordinarily, we can learn such lessons from one instance of the word “any” and apply it to other similar situations. Here, however, leaven and honey each have additional stringencies not found in the laws of the other, so the word “any” had to be repeated.<br />
<br />
What happens if one does offer an offering from leaven and from honey on the Altar? Rava says that he incurs four sets of lashes, one for leaven, one for honey, one for mixtures of leaven, and one for mixtures of honey. However, Abaye says that he incurs no lashes at all, since one never incurs lashes for violating a generalized prohibition. In this case, generalized prohibition means that the Torah stated two preconditions, “any leaven and any honey,” and concluded with one prohibition, "do not offer." Some say, however, that at least one set of lashes he does incur.<br />

Menachot 59 – No Oil and No Frankincense

Normally, one mixes in oil and puts frankincense on top of the offering. This includes all fine-flour offerings brought as free-will offerings, those cooked on a griddle, in a pan, loaves, wafers, the daily offering of a High Priest, and the offering of a non-Jew.<br />
<br />
The flour offering of libations, brought together with an animal sacrifice, requires only oil. The Bread of vision requires only frankincense but no oil. The two loaves of Shavuot require neither oil nor frankincense, and the same is true of the sinner's offering and the offering of jealousies. If one did put oil on the offering of jealousies, he has invalidated it, but if he placed frankincense, it should be removed, and the offering is valid.<br />
<br />
Rabbah bar Rav Huna asked Rabbi Yochanan, what is the law if one put finely ground frankincense on the sinner's offering? The rule above said that frankincense should be removed, but this one is finely ground and cannot be removed. To this the answer was found: such offering becomes invalid.<br />

Menachot 6 – Non-Kohen Cannot Do the Flour Service

The same is true if the service has been performed by a mourner, by an impure person even if he went to the mikvah and will be pure at night, by a kohen who lacks some of the priestly garments, by one who has not washed his hands and a feet, who is uncircumcised, is sitting, or is standing on his colleague’s feet.<br />
<br />
If one did the service with his left hand, it is invalid, but Ben Beteira says that he can re-do it with his right hand.<br />
<br />
If, while he was taking a handful, a pebble, a grain of salt, or a particle of frankincense came up in his hand, making the handful incomplete, the service is invalid. The rule is: if he took more than a handful or less than a handful, the offering is invalid. For example, if flour was showing between his fingers (too much) or if he took it with his forefingers (too little), the offering is invalid.<br />

Menachot 60 – Bringing Near and Waving

It involves taking the vessel with the offering and touching it to the southwestern corner of the Altar. This is done prior to taking off a handful. “Waving” is required for many offerings, including some flour offerings. <br />
<br />
There are offerings that require bringing near, but do not require waving: fine-flour offerings brought as free-will offerings, those cooked on a griddle, in a pan, loaves, wafers, the daily offering of a High Priest, the offering of a non-Jew, and the offering of a sinner.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that the flour offering of a kohen and that of a High Priest do not require bringing near, since they do not require taking off a handful but are instead burned completely on the Altar – and the rule is that any offering that does not require taking off a handful also does not require bringing it near the Altar.<br />

Before a metzora was purified, he had to bring these, and they were “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/10-15.htm">waved as a wave service to God</a>.” According to Rabbi Eliezer ban Yakov, the first fruit were also waved before they were given to a kohen to eat. <br />
<br />
Also waved were the parts of an individual's peace offering that were offered on the Altar, and the breast and thigh portions of it – which were given to the priests.<br />
<br />
How were the <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/29-27.htm">loaves and lambs of Shavuot waved</a>? Before the lambs were slaughtered, the kohen would put the two breads on top of the two lambs, place his hands beneath them, then extend them outward and bring them inward, raise them and lower them.<br />
<br />
While bringing near was at the southwest corner of the Altar, waving had to be done to the east of the Altar, and if both were required, waving preceded bringing near.<br />

How is this accomplished? The priest places his hands below the hands of the owner and waves the portions. If there is bread to go with the sacrifice, it is placed on top of the other portions, just as they did at the Inauguration service in the desert.<br />
<br />
Earlier we said that with the two breads and two lambs on Shavuot the breads are put on the lambs. Actually, there are four opinions about this. The Torah said that “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/23-20.htm">the kohen shall wave the lambs upon the first-offerings breads</a>” and “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/23-20.htm">upon the two lambs</a>.” The first opinion follows the Inauguration service. Rabbi Yose ben Hamshullam says that the lambs were on top, and “on the lambs” means with the two lambs, and not with the seven lambs brought at another time. Rabbi Chanina says that the breads were between the thighs of the lambs, thus fulfilling both verses. Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that it would be unseemly even before a earthly king, but rather that they were placed side by side, and “on” means “together with.”<br />

Menachot 63 –Fried and Baked Flour Offerings

The latter was a griddle with only a slight lip around it. Rabbi Yose HaGlili says that the difference between the deep and flat offering is that the first one has a cover, but Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel says that the cover has nothing to do with it, but that the offering prepared in a deep pan is soft and it quivers, whereas the one prepared in a shallow pan is thin and hard.<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai are not certain if “deep” refers to the pan or to the offering, so according to them one who promises a deep-pan offering (not an offering in a deep pan) has to wait until Elijah the Prophet comes and explains how to do it. <br />
<br />
The oven-baked flour offering can be either loaves baked with oil or wafers baked without oil and smeared with oil after baking. It was baked in a stove called “tanur,” which had a trapezoidal shape with an opening at the top. Bread was baked by affixing it to the walls of the oven.<br />

The offering consisted of an one-tenth of an ephah measure (about 50 pounds), and thus amounted to 5 pounds. Actually, a complete ephah was harvested, ground, and sieved thirteen times, to produce the required one-tenth.<br />
<br />
The special question would come up on Shabbat. The barley could still be harvested, since the Torah required this offering, even on Shabbat, but the question was whether they should minimize the Shabbat violation. Rabbi Ishmael says that on Shabbat they would harvest enough barley only for an ephah, but on weekday – much more, to produce the best final quality of flour. However, the Sages say that they used the same amount on Shabbat and on weekdays.<br />
<br />
In the same vein, Rabbi Chanina the Deputy Kohen allowed only one person to do the reaping on Shabbat, and three on a weekday, but the Sages required three people, each with their own sickle and basket, both on Shabbat and on a weekday.<br />

However, once it happened that they brought it from a far away place called Gagot Tzerifin.<br />
<br />
When the two rulers, descendants of the Maccabeans, fought, one of them besieged Jerusalem. Those inside kept bringing sacrifices which they bought from the assailants. One old man in Jerusalem transmitted to the assailants through signs that the sacrifices shielded Jerusalem, and the next time when they lowered the basket with money, back came a pig. It stuck its hooves into the wall of Jerusalem, and the whole Land of Israel shook. It was at this time that they could not find any barley, but one mute man came and put one hand on a roof (gag) and another on a hut (tzerif). Mordechai was there and said, “Is there a place called Gagot Tzerifin or Tzerifin Gagot?” They searched and found barley there.<br />
<br />
Before Passover they prepared the barley by tying it into bundles. On the night after the first day of Passover, a crowd went to that field. Once it became dark, the reaper would ask them, “Has the sun set?” and they answered “Yes.” This dialog repeated three times. Then he asked “This sickle?”, “This basket?” and they would answer yes, and repeat. On Shabbat, he would ask “Is it Shabbat?” Then he would say, “Shall I reap?”, they would answer “Reap!” This repeated three times. Why was all this necessary? Because of those who said that the barley had to be brought on the first Saturday night after the Festival.<br />

But the Sages say that before roasting the barley they would beat it with soft reeds and stems, to remove the kernels from the stalks without crushing them, and then they would put it into a copper pipe to be roasted. The pipe was perforated to spread the fire over all of it.<br />
<br />
After the barley was threshed and roasted, they spread it out in the Courtyard, to let the wind blow over it to dry it. They would then put it into a bean mill and grind it coarsely. Then they would sift it with thirteen sieves, extracting one-tenth of the total volume as fine flour. The remainder had to be redeemed with money and then could be eaten by anyone. <br />

He takes the one-tenth of an ephah (about 5 pounds) of flour prepared for this purpose, puts the oil in an empty vessel, together with the frankincense on the side, and adds the flour. He pours more oil into the flour and mixes them. He then waves the mixture in all for directions of the compass, as well as up and down. Then a kohen takes off a handful and burns it, together with frankincense, on the Altar. The remainder of the flour is eaten by the kohanim in the Temple Courtyard.<br />
<br />
Once the Omer was offered, all harvest of this year became permitted. People would go out into the marketplaces of Jerusalem and find them full with regular flour of the new crop, as well as oven-dried grain – but this was against the wishes of the Sages, says Rabbi Meir. Technically, it was allowed to pluck the new grain by hand and prepare it, but according to Rabbi Meir, the Sages forbade this practice, out of concern that people might eat new grain too early. Rabbi Yehudah says that this practice was approved by the Sages.<br />

However, we saw them having the opposite views! For example, if one missed searching for leaven before Passover, Rabbi Yehudah prohibits him to search, lest he comes to eat it. The answer is that Rabbi Yehudah is not worried about new grain, because people do not eat it all year, but they do eat leaven. And the Sages? They say, he is searching for leaven to burn it, will he eat it?<br />
<br />
If there is no Temple and no Omer offering, the new grain becomes permitted with the sunrise on the second day of Passover. However, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai established that the new grain should not be eaten until the end of the day. Why? Any time the Temple may  be rebuilt. Then the people may make a mistake and reason thus: last year we ate the new grain right after the first day of Passover, so let's do it this year! And they won't know that last year there was no Omer, but now that there is one, they have to wait.<br />

Nevertheless, since new grain was already permitted to people, if they brought it in the Temple before Shavuot, the offering was valid.<br />
<br />
Rava bar Rav Chanan asked a question, what is the status of the grain that was planted? If one decides to take it out and eat, is it new crop and does it need the Omer offering first? Additionally, is it a movable property which is subject to the law of overcharge, or is it like land, not subject to the law of overcharge?<br />
<br />
Rami bar Chama asked a question, if an elephant swallowed palm fiber which emerged intact from its digestive tract, and someone made them into a basket, is the fiber considered digested and therefore the basket is immune to ritual impurity? Consider the case of wolves who swallowed two infants in Transjordan, and then excreted them whole, and the Sages declared the meat digested and therefore pure! - No, it is not the same, the meat is softer than fiber. But the bones the Sages declared impure! - No proof, since the bones are harder. Thus, no answer.<br />

<br />
But Avimi was the teacher, not the student of Rav Chisda! - Yes, he was the teacher, but he forgot the laws of flour offerings and had to go to the academy of his student to learn them again. - But he could have called Rav Chisda to himself?! - Avimi thought that by taking the trouble of going and by suffering the additional humiliation of learning from his student, he will remember it better.<br />
<br />
Resuming the narrative, Rav Nachman met Avimi and asked him, “How does one do kemitzah, separation of a handful of flour?” Avimi answered, “Like from this vessel,” pointing to the vessel on the ground. “Even on the ground?” - asked Rav Nachman. Avimi said, “No, I meant that another Kohen holds the vessel up.” “Then you need three Kohanim, one to hold the vessel, one to separate the handful, and one more to receive the handful into another vessel,” - said Rav Nachman. “Yes, even thirteen, if need be,” - answered Avimi.<br />

Does “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/23-17.htm">from your dwelling places</a>” exclude places outside the Land of Israel, or does it exclude even the tornado?<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi asked, “An ear of grain that reached the third of its size before the Omer, then one uprooted it and replanted after the Omer, is it permitted old crop, because the root is more important, or is forbidden new crop, because of the new growth?”<br />
<br />
For many laws the following species are special: wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. One who makes dough from them is obligated to give challah – the first portion of the dough – to a kohen. They combine with each other to form the amount (about 5 pounds) necessary for challah. It is forbidden to eat them before the Omer is brought, and it is forbidden to harvest them before Passover. The Omer permits them as long as they have taken root before it. These species that can leaven and become prohibited on Passover, and these same species are what matzah is made of.<br />

Since their harvest is not fit for the Omer offering, it is allowed to harvest them prior to it. However, one should not pile the grain, because he may come to eat it. The Jewish residents of Jericho harvested the  irrigated fields before the Omer, which agreed with the wishes of the Sages, but they also piled the grain, which disagreed with the wishes of the Sages, who nevertheless did not reprove them in that case.<br />
<br />
One may harvest unripe grain in order to feed it to the animals. Rabbi Yehudah says that this is only allowed if he started harvesting before the grain reached a third of its growth. Rabbi Shimon disagrees and allows to harvest unripe grain for animal fodder even after it grew to  a third. One may harvest the new grain to save the trees sapling in the field, or to clear room for mourners to sit down, or for a public Torah study.<br />
<br />
The reaping and other works for the Omer has to be done on the night after the first day of Pesach, even if it is Shabbat.<br />

This teaches that although the commandment is to cut barley specifically for that purpose, still, if they found none, but only barley that is already cut, they can use it. Furthermore, even though the commandment is to reap that barley on the night of the first day of Passover, if they forgot or if the barley harvested at night became invalidated, they can still cut it on the following day. Finally, the commandment is to reap and process the barley on that night, even if it happens to be Shabbat and even if they happen to be ritually impure.<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Akiba stated a general rule (talking about circumcision that can also be done on Shabbat) that if some labor can be done before Shabbat, then it should be done before Shabbat. How is that reconciled with above? The above follows Rabbi Shimon's principle that “beloved is the mitzvah done in its proper time.” For example, for the daily sacrifice brought on Shabbat they would continue the service and burn its limbs, even though they could have done that later. <br />

The portion scooped up in the Kohen's hand is a kometz, or handful, and what remains is remnants that are eaten by the kohanim. <br />
<br />
The following flour offerings are subject to taking off a handful: a fine-flour offering (where the handful is taken when it is dough), the deep pan and flat pan offerings (where the handful is taken off from the baked pieces, or according to some, from the fine meal made out of them), the oven-baked offering, the offering of an idolater, Omer, the offering of a sinner, and the offering of jealousies.<br />
<br />
Chizkiyah taught a rule: if a law has no application in its context, use it in another context. For example, the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-10.htm">Every flour offering... will be for the sons of Aharon</a>.” Since we already know this from “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-1.htm">this is the law of the flour offering</a>,” this teaches instead other laws: that a kohen cannot exchange his portion of the flour offering for a meat or bird offering.<br />

This teaching needs explanation. It lists the oil applications in the reverse order. First, some of the oil is put into a vessel and the flour is placed on it. The lukewarm water is added and the ingredients are kneaded. Second, more oil is introduced and mixed in. Third, one pours in the remaining oil to fulfill the mitzvah of pouring. Why does the teaching mention “sacred vessels?” - To exclude an oven, which this teacher does not consider a sacred vessel.<br />
<br />
When exactly is the oil mixed in as the second step? Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that this is done after the offering has been made into loaves, but the Sages say that one mixes the oil in while it is still flour.<br />
<br />
There are two oven-baked offerings, challot and wafers. Challot require mixing with oil, whereas wafers are smeared with oil after baking. Smearing is done in the form of the Greek letter chi, and the remaining oil is consumed by the kohanim.<br />

Menachot 76 – Folding the Matzah

The regular flour offering was folded in half, then again in half, to fulfill the commanded of “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-6.htm">break it into pieces</a>,” but that of a kohen was folded only once.<br />
<br />
All flour offerings require three hundred rubbings and five hundred poundings applied to its wheat. Rabbi Yose says that they were applied to the dough. All flour offerings were brought in groups of ten loaves, except for the Breads of Vision, <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-5.htm">which were brought in groups of twelve</a>, – these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah, who takes the ten loaves from the thanksgiving offering. Rabbi Meir says that they were all made of twelve loaves, except for the thanksgiving offering.<br />
<br />
The Omer offering consisted of one-tenth of a se'ah measure (about 5 pounds), the two loaves of Shavuot of two one-tenths, and the Bread of Vision of twenty-four tenths. The Omer with sifted through thirteen sieves, two loaves – with twelve sieves, and the Bread of Vision with eleven sieves. Rabbi Shimon says that there was no set number of sieves.<br />

Menachot 77 – How Much Flour for the Thanksgiving Offering

The bread came in four varieties, ten loaves of each type. Ten loaves were leavened, and thirty loaves were unleavened, or matzah, but in flour requirement the leavened and the unleavened breads were equal.<br />
<br />
The thanksgiving offering was made of two measures called “ephah,” which equaled twenty “tenths” or “issaron,” or approximately 100 pounds of flour. In the desert, they used a measure called “se'ah,” and this amounted to six se'ah. When they came to Jerusalem, they increased all measures by 20%, so in new measures this was not six but five se'ah. <br />
<br />
The leavened loaves were three time larger than the unleavened ones. The latter were of three types: oven-baked loaves, wafers, and loaves first scalded in water, then baked, and finally fried in oil.<br />
<br />
From each of the four types of bread, the kohen would take one whole bread as his portion, and the remainder was eaten by the owner. To eat it before the next morning, the owner had to invite many guests, and he would explain to all what his thanksgiving was for.<br />

The inauguration offering required only the non-leaved parts of the thanksgiving offering, that is, oven-baked loaves, wafers, and loaves first scalded in water. The offering of a nazir required only the first two types, that is, oven-baked loaves and wafers.<br />
<br />
Usually, an animal becomes an offering when the owner designates it as such, and then it cannot be used for any other purpose. The breads that accompany a thanksgiving offering becomes sanctified not by owner's declaration, but by the slaughter of the animal. Thus, if he slaughtered the animal while the breads were outside the Courtyard, the bread did not become sanctified. Likewise, if the breads were still baking when he slaughtered the offering and their surface did not crust, or even of all the loaves crusted except one, the bread did not become sanctified.<br />

<br />
If the animal, after slaughter, was found to be sick and non-viable, then, since it had this defect from before, the breads did not become sanctified. If the animal was found to have a minor blemish in the eye, then Rabbi Eliezer says that the breads did become sanctified, because once this animal is on the Altar, it need not be brought down, but the Sages disagree.<br />
<br />
Some sacrifices require libations, which may include wine and flour. These, unlike the breads of the thanksgiving, get sanctified on their own, once they touch the Temple vessel. If such libations became sanctified and then their sacrifices was found to be invalid, then if there is another sacrifice in need of libations, they can be brought with it, but if not, they become disqualified at night and are subsequently destroyed. Others opine that libations get sanctified with the slaughter. <br />

Menachot 8 – The Flour Offering of the High Priest, in Halves

The dough was made into twelve loaves baked on a shallow pan, and he brought six in the morning and six in the afternoon. <br />
<br />
The Priest may want to place half of the flour in a vessel and sanctify it, then later do this for the other half. Regarding this, Rabbi Yochanan said that it cannot be sanctified in halves, but Rabbi Elazar allowed it.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Yochanan? The verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-20.htm">flour offering... half of it</a>...” means, “bring the complete offering and then divide it in halves.” And what is the reason of Rabbi Elazar? - Since it is offered in halves, it can be sanctified in halves.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">What can Rabbi Elazar answer to the verse used by Rabbi Yochanan? He agrees that it is better to do everything at once, but if the Priest did it in halves, this is  also valid. But the Torah uses the word “statute,” which means to be observed precisely?! - The Priest brings the complete amount from his home, but then can divide it.<br />

Menachot 80 – Accidental Thanksgiving

If the female thanksgiving animal gave birth, its offspring is automatically sanctified as another thanksgiving, like its mother. However, unlike its mother, it does not require the forty breads to come with it.<br />
<br />
Similarly, if one says “let this animal be a substitute for this thanksgiving offering,” he has done something that is not right – for <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/27-10.htm">substitutes are prohibited</a> – but his words take effect, and now both animals are thanksgiving offerings; however, the second one is brought without the breads. This rule is also true when his thanksgiving offering was lost, he designated another one instead, and then the first one was found.<br />
<br />
Why this rule? – The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-12.htm">Then he shall offer with the thanksgiving offering matzah loaves</a>...” to teach us that only the thanksgiving offering requires loaves, but neither its offspring, its replacement, or its substitute require loaves.<br />

If one of them dies, the other one cannot be brought: if the live one is the thanksgiving, it needs breads, and if it is the exchange, it does not need bread. The students throughout time made eight attempts to resolve this problem and find the way to bring the animal. At fourth attempt by Levy, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince remarked, “This one looks like he has no brains in his head,” which was perfectly in order, since the students deduced laws even from Rabbi Yehudah's tone of answers.<br />
<br />
If one promises to bring a thanksgiving offering, he should use the animal and the breads from regular supplies. If he says, “I will bring it from the regular supplies and the breads from tithe,” his first words takes effect, and he has to bring both from regular supplies. If he promises to bring both from tithe, he may do so, only he should not bring the wheat kernels of tithe, but rather use the tithe money.<br />

Why is this? – The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">You shall slaughter the passover offering to God, your Lord, flocks and cattle</a>.” However, this cannot be understood literally, because the passover offering can come only from lambs and goats, and not from cattle. Then what does the word “cattle” teach us? To compare every other offering to the passover one, and say that just as a passover offering is an obligatory sacrifice that can be brought only from your own regular funds, so too every obligatory offering may be brought only from regular funds, and not from tithe. <br />
<br />
When one promises to bring a thanksgiving or a peace offering, he creates an obligation, and every obligatory offering must be brought from his own funds. Even when in his obligation he specifies to bring the animal from tithe, still the libations must come from regular funds – because all tithe must be eaten, and libations are not eaten but are rather completely offered on the Altar.<br />

But how do we know this about Passover in the first place?<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says, “We had a Passover offering in Egypt, and we also had it throughout the generations. Just as the one in Egypt had to be brought from private funds – because the tithe could only be taken from produce grown in Israel, which was not yet available – so too for all generations, the Passover offering has to be brought from private funds.” Rabbi Akiba answered, “How can we learn possible from the impossible? In Egypt it was impossible to use tithe, and afterwards it was possible!”  What does Rabbi Eliezer have to say? - “Even though it is an impossibility, we can learn a great lesson from it, because the first Passover Seder was a model for all later ones to come.”<br />

The villages of Machnis and Zitcha were the “alpha” of fine flour. Next in quality was the place called Aforaim, located in the valley (as opposed to another Aforaim in the mountains). All lands were therefore acceptable, but in practice they would only bring the grain from these.<br />

Menachot 85 – How to Grow the Best Grain
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggGKjSoXizaoRy41ZZYvx-UH-7GafRvL4-aMTZFXl2zNl4KuM6XqfRekVxY0IxMkra6m-72CHu5mv0O5-kjDQszSr1RrnAZVLxmzIlNoGnq91q_Zh8564BaRJ-NZ7XReqhzHX_W30zWno/s1600/Samuel+Bough+-+Sowing+the+Seed.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="258" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggGKjSoXizaoRy41ZZYvx-UH-7GafRvL4-aMTZFXl2zNl4KuM6XqfRekVxY0IxMkra6m-72CHu5mv0O5-kjDQszSr1RrnAZVLxmzIlNoGnq91q_Zh8564BaRJ-NZ7XReqhzHX_W30zWno/s320/Samuel+Bough+-+Sowing+the+Seed.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">For flour offerings, they would not use grain from fertilized fields, because once the field requires fertilization, perhaps it was not fertilized enough, or possibly because the use of fertilizer, which is malodorous, adversely affects the taste of the produce. They also did not use the grain from irrigated fields or from a field of trees, because it was not of the best quality. Such grain, though, would be acceptable after the fact.<br />
<br />
How then does one work the land to produce superior grain? He plows it the first year in the summer without sowing it in the winter. This gets rid of the thorns. Then in the second year he plows it again and now sows it, seventy days before Passover, and it produces abundant flour.<br />
<br />
How does one examine the flour? The Temple treasurer inserts his hand into it, and if dust comes up in his hand, the flour is invalid until he sifts it again. If the flour became wormy, it is permanently disqualified.<br />
<br />
Additional story - too much oil
<br /><br />
The Torah states, “He will dip his foot in oil” – that's talking about the land portion of Asher, where oil flows like a spring – because olive oil expands the mind.
<br /><br />
Once the people of Ludkiya needed oil. They appointed an agent to seek out the amount of oil bought for a million maneh, which equals to 400,000,000 golden dinars. The agent went to Jerusalem, this being the capital, but they told him to go to Tyre, which is a large port town. There, however, they directed him to Gush Chalav, in the portion of Asher.
<br /><br />
He came to Gush Chalav, and there they told him, “Go to so and so, to that certain field.” There he found a Jewish farmer, who was digging and hoeing under his olive trees. The agent asked, “Do you have the amount of oil for a million maneh?” - but the farmer replied, “Please wait till I finish my work.” After the farmer finished his work, he tied his tools and put them over his shoulder. As he was going, he was clearing away the stones from the field. The agent thought to himself, “Can such a hard-working man have that much oil? The Jews played a trick on me!”
<br /><br />
However, when the Jewish farmer reached his city, his maidservant brought out for him a small kettle of hot water, and he washed his hands and feet in it. Then she brought out for him a golden basin filled with oil, and he dipped his hands and feet in it, to fulfill literally the verse of “he dips his foot in oil.”
<br /><br />
After they ate and drank, the farmer measured out to the agent the million maneh's worth of oil, and then he said, “Do you need any more?” The agent said, “But I have no money left!” The farmer replied to him, “Take more, and I will come and collect the payment.” He measured out another 180 thousand maneh wroth of oil, and the agent had to rent every animal, horse, mule, camel, and donkey in Israel to transport the oil.
<br /><br />
The people of Ludkiya came to greet and praise their agent, but gave all honor to the farmer, who fulfilled the verse from king Solomon, “There is one who gives the impression of wealthy but has nothing, and there is one who gives the impression of being poor and has great wealth.”

The city of Tekoa provided the “alpha” quality of oil, second to it was Regev from Trans-Jordan, and oil from other places was also valid. They &nbsp;avoided olives from fertilized or watered fields, or from fields where seeds were also grown. Oil from olives soaked in water, picked, or boiled was invalid. People of Tekoa were considered wise because they consumed oil regularly, and oil also led to great riches, as in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/06/menachot-story-of-too-much-oil.html">story about a rich farmer</a>.<br />
<br />
Three times a year the olives are harvested, and in each harvest three grades of oil are extracted. For the first harvest one picks the crop from the top of the olive tree. He then pounds the olives in a mortar and puts them inside the basket. He then presses the olives with the beams to extract more oil. Finally, he grinds the olives with millstones and again presses them with a beam to extract yet more oil. The first oil is valid for the Menorah, and the other oils are valid for flour offerings. For the second crop he collects the olives from the rooftops of the nearby houses, and for the third one he collects the remaining olives in a vat.<br />

Menachot 87 – Which Wine?

<br />
They avoided wines from fertilized fields, fields requiring irrigation, and fields where other seeds were also sown. Old, sweet, smoked, or cooked wines were invalid. Wine was not stored in large casks but in small barrel, and the barrel was not full, so that the aroma would spread when the barrel is opened.<br />
<br />
The best rams came from Moav, lambs from Hebron, calves from Sharon. Rabbi Yehudah says that the best lambs are those whose height is like their width. Rava bar Rav Shila explained this with the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/30-23.htm">your livestock will graze on that day, a broad lamb</a>.” He also said that God posted angels around the walls, whose task was to remind Him about Jerusalem. And what did these angels say before destruction? “<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/132-13.htm">God chose Zion, desired it for His dwelling</a>.”<br />
<br />
There were two standard measures for flour in the Temple, “issaron” and half of “issaron,” for the standard flour offering and for the one of the High Priest.<br />

Menachot 88 – Seven Measures for Liquids

Rabbi Shimon says that the hin was not there, because only Moses used it, and then only once, but others claim that they kept Moses' hin. All that is based on the tradition that one needs seven liquid measures, and the measures have to be full. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok say that there was only one hin-measure, with incremental markings. He does not agree to the tradition of “seven measures.”<br />
<br />
What function did each measure serve? For example, the quarter-log was to measure the quarter-log of water for the purification of metzora (spiritual leper) and for the quarter-log of oil of a nazir.<br />
<br />
For all flour offerings the oil had to be measured with the “log” measure, so that an offering of sixty issaron (300 pounds) required to measure the log of oil sixty times. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov says that even a flour offering of sixty issaron would have only one log of oil in it.<br />

One may mix together the libations of bulls with the libations of rams, because they contain the same proportion of oil, that is, two logs (one cup) of oil per issaron (five pounds) of flour. <br />
<br />
The libations of lambs may be mixed with the libations of other lambs. These contain three logs (one-and-a-half cup) of oil per issaron of flour. One can even mix the libations of private individual's lamb with the libations of a communal lamb, and even those of today with those of tomorrow – as long as they did not get sanctified in a vessel.<br />
<br />
If one made the libations of bulls and accidentally mixed with the libations of lambs, they are valid, even though of different oil consistency – because they do not mix further. But if one mixed them before the ingredients were combined, the result is invalid.<br />

How do we know that? The Torah says “<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/18-10.htm">in the most holy you shall eat it</a>” Most holy here means the Sanctuary, of the Temple Hall.<br />
<br />
But why would we need a verse to prove it? If offerings do not get disqualified in the Courtyard, which is subsidiary to the Hall, then of course they do not get disqualified in the Hall itself!? - That is true, they do not get disqualified, but for eating them we need a special permission. This is similar to a servant doing his work before his master, but to eat in the presence of his master – for that the servant needs a special permission. Therefore the verse teaches us that it is allowed.<br />

This follows the rule “there is no room for  poverty in the place of opulence.” The only exception to this was the daily flour offering of the High Priest, whose measure was leveled.<br />
<br />
Regarding liquid measures, their overbrim (liquid that rests above the level of the rim due to surface tension) is sacred, but the heap of dry measures is non-sacred. The teacher who composed this part of the ruling argues with the one who started it (also called the first teacher or tanna kama) about the sacredeness of the heap.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiba agrees that the liquid measures and their overbrim is sacred, but he argues about the dry ones and says that even the inside of the measure was not sanctified. Rabbi Yose says that the law of the overbrim is explained thus: liquids mix, and liquid top is as if it came from the inside, but dry measures do not mix.<br />
<br />
All sacrifices required libations, except for Passover, firstborn, and tithes, as well as sin offerings.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">The Torah said, “When you shall make a fire offering to God, burned offering, or another sacrifice.” I might have thought that any offering that goes on the fire requires libations, and even an offering of flour requires another flour libation with it. The prevent this, the Torah states “burned offering,” to exclude a flour offering. And how do I know that a peace offering requires libations? From the words “another sacrifice.” <br />
<br />
Among the sin-offerings, only the sin-offering of a metzorah (spiritual leper) and his guilt-offering require libations. How do I know that? The Torah stated, “the three-tenths of fine flour for a flour offering,” - and this is talking about an animal sacrifice of a metzorah. But perhaps he should bring a flour offering by itself? - Since the Torah later says “the kohen shall offer the burned offering and flour,” this leads me to understand that the Torah is speaking about the flour that comes with the animal offering.<br />

If it was a sin-offering, he confessed his sin, and if it was a thanksgiving offering, he offered thanks to God. <br />
<br />
Communal offerings do not require leaning, except for the bull that comes for communal violations, and the he-goat dispatched to Azazel on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon says that the he-goat for communal idolatry required leaning. There was a tradition that exactly two communal offerings required leaning, but they argued about which they were.<br />
<br />
All private offering required leaning, except for the first-born, tithe, and Passover offering. If one's father died and left a sacrifice, his son brings that sacrifice, performs leaning, brings the libations, and even has the power to appoint a replacement sacrifice. As we learned before, when one appoints a replacement, both animals become sacrifices, but to effect this, one needs to be a complete owner, and this teaches us that the son is a complete owner.<br />

However, there are some people who are exempt from this requirement. Thus, a deaf-mute, a deranged person, and a minor don't have the requirement of leaning, because they are not legally competent. In truth, since they cannot even consecrate an offering or bring it of their own free will, they are very rarely in a situation where leaning would be discussed.<br />
<br />
There are also categories of people who can bring a sacrifice without leaning altogether, and these include a non-Jew, a slave, an agent, and a woman. The agent of a person cannot perform leaning, because it says “your hand” - and not your agent's hand. A woman is not required to lean on her sacrifice because the Torah said “sons of Israel,” to exclude “daughters of Israel” from the requirement of leaning.<br />
<br />
Even if one is required to perform leaning and does not do it, the sacrifice is valid – although it is not done completely right. The leaning is done with both hands and is immediately followed with slaughter.<br />

But in some aspects waving is stricter than leaning: waving applies to the individual and community sacrifices, live or slaughtered ones, and it even applies to non-living matter, such as loaves.<br />
<br />
The two loaves on Shavuot were kneaded one by one and baked one by one, but the twelve breads of vision, brought every Shabbat, were kneaded one by one and baked in pairs. The reason for separate kneading is so that every loaf would get its correct amount of flour.<br />
<br />
The breads of vision were baked in a mold and then transferred to another golden mold. Baking in a mold was required because of the breads' special shape: according to Rabbi Chanina, they were shaped like an open box, and according to Rabbi Yochanan, they were shaped like a small fast boat dancing on the waves.<br />

Menachot 95 – Where Was the Bread of Vision Baked?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKJFz2qhYUltJWur31A_YkKlTZ-Vr0HSklikfiH0V17i4mwRGSscPYtwwLXBruFfShMaCS-5QrlY5szLYjQr3X3vtyvWJ2u1-cmKmO-cX-jMDEvxP3KiUjcoOVhs9yzKcleXQOFGX_i5c/s1600/Pieter+de+Hooch+-+A+Woman+Preparing+Bread+and+Butter+for+a+Boy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKJFz2qhYUltJWur31A_YkKlTZ-Vr0HSklikfiH0V17i4mwRGSscPYtwwLXBruFfShMaCS-5QrlY5szLYjQr3X3vtyvWJ2u1-cmKmO-cX-jMDEvxP3KiUjcoOVhs9yzKcleXQOFGX_i5c/s320/Pieter+de+Hooch+-+A+Woman+Preparing+Bread+and+Butter+for+a+Boy.jpg" width="248" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">When the Jews traveled in the desert, did the Bread of Vision become invalid at the beginning of each journey? Since the  the bread was moved from its place, is this  the same as leaving the curtains, or does the Tabernacle retain its status to protect the bread from invalidation?  Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi argue about this, but we do not know who held what view. Based on the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/2-17.htm">as they encamp so shall they journey</a>,” the bread in travel becomes invalid just as in the encampment, but based on “<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/4-7.htm">and the constant bread shall remain upon the table</a>,” the bread remains valid.<br />
<br />
The bread of vision was kneaded outside the Temple – because vessels did not sanctify the flour – and baked inside the Temple before Shabbat. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: it was kneaded and baked inside the Temple, on Shabbat, to protect the bread from staying overnight. Rabbi Shimon maintains that both ways are valid. Their proofs are not based on the <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/21-6.htm">story of King David and the priestly bread</a> – for David had a case of boulimia – extreme hunger – but on tradition.<br />

Menachot 96 – Wafers of the High Priest
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2PWvqYJl5wyd6cOyAv64gfWEkiD6rkUSeX2lTuin5-Al6BdUUA2CQvw28BpOUsyDSiwzz3ZHbZQC9mrMYlKJW8x5ZetlPaVzb-90Q4k48RTy6YsTuTy9fECU_hsFUcb3URSSeFDUGkiw/s1600/Evaristo+Baschenis+-+Boy+With+A+Basket+Of+Bread.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2PWvqYJl5wyd6cOyAv64gfWEkiD6rkUSeX2lTuin5-Al6BdUUA2CQvw28BpOUsyDSiwzz3ZHbZQC9mrMYlKJW8x5ZetlPaVzb-90Q4k48RTy6YsTuTy9fECU_hsFUcb3URSSeFDUGkiw/s320/Evaristo+Baschenis+-+Boy+With+A+Basket+Of+Bread.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Each day, the High Priest brought twelve wafers, six in the morning and six in the afternoon. In the morning he would bring and consecrate a full tenth (issaron, or 5-pound measure) of flour and divide it into two halves. Kneading and baking of the wafers was done daily, even on Shabbat, but grinding and sifting of their flour was done before. Rabbi Akiva formulated a rule: “Even when the Torah allowed a  labor on Shabbat, it allowed only that portion of it that could not be done before Shabbat.”<br />
<br />
The two loaves on Shavuot were seven hand-breadths long and four hand-breadths wide. They had strips of dough at the corners, or “horns,” that were four finger-breadths long. The breads of visions were larger: ten hand-breadths long, five hand-breadths wide, and their “horns” were seven finger-breadths in length.<br />
<br />
Ben Zoma explained that the “Bread of Vision” can also be translated as the “Bread of Faces,” meaning that it should have many “faces,” or surfaces, thus the complicated shape.<br />

The table was stationary, never carried around, and because of this should not be susceptible to spiritual impurity – except that every holiday the priests took the table and showed it to the pilgrims, to demonstrate that the bread was fresh and warm after a week, just as when it was baked. This is based on the phrase in Samuel, “<a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/21-6.htm">To place bread that is hot on the day it is taken off</a>.”<br />
<br />
There were four props of gold on the table and twenty-eight rods, each like half a hollow reed, to separate the breads from one another, in order that they would not become moldy. This is based on  the phrase in the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/25-29.htm">For [the table] make bread forms,incense bowls, and side frames, as well as the half tubes that will serve as dividers [between the loaves of bread]. All these shall be made of pure gold</a>.”<br />

Menachot 98 – Chamber of Standard Measures
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhN3MI14dwIDBEtWd2_8BlBLbLF4EqwHpibsnEabCp2TxCW0e5WA91_TMSouX5THp8I56Ts8U-JmlZD0Ax1O1uo0VE1j4Uftga9UrT_MyvRDqoRmXRwMjvGAjeM5AHEq_iUHS-DmX9USyM/s1600/Luigi+Ademollo+-+The+Menorah.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhN3MI14dwIDBEtWd2_8BlBLbLF4EqwHpibsnEabCp2TxCW0e5WA91_TMSouX5THp8I56Ts8U-JmlZD0Ax1O1uo0VE1j4Uftga9UrT_MyvRDqoRmXRwMjvGAjeM5AHEq_iUHS-DmX9USyM/s320/Luigi+Ademollo+-+The+Menorah.jpg" width="261" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">In the Temple there was a chamber called “Shushan the Great City,” because it had a picture of Shushan, the capital of Persia. There they kept two measuring sticks used for Temple work. <br />
<br />
The original measure of length called “amah” or “arm” in English, established by Moses, was six hand-breadths. Since each hand-breadth equals four finger-breadths (actually, thumb-breadths), the amah of Moses was thus 24 finger-breadths. The two Temple measures were slightly longer, one measuring 24.5 finger-breadths, and the other – 25 finger-breadths. When craftsmen took orders for Temple work, they quoted the price according to the amah of Moses, but they delivered their results according to the amah of the Temple, that is, slightly more – to avoid accidental misappropriation of the Temple property. The shorter of the two Temple measure, the 24.5 finger-breadths, was used for golden and silver utensils, and the longer one, the 25 finger-breadths – for construction work.<br />
<br />
King Solomon made ten tables in the Temple, with the table of Moses in the center of them. He also made ten menorahs, with the menorah of Moses in the center.<br />

However, they put bread only on the one table that Moses had made, and lighted only one menorah. Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua says that they used all the tables, since it says “<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">The tables with the bread upon them</a>.” How does the other teacher explain the plural “tables?” He says that they always used three tables anyway: the breads were prepared on a silver table, then they were placed in the Holy of Holies on a golden table, and after they were removed from there, they were put on a third table, also of gold.<br />
<br />
Why was the third table made of gold? Because of the rule, “we raise in holiness but never bring down.” What is the source for this rule? When <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/40-18.htm">Moses assembled the Tabernacle</a>, he did it all by himself. Once the work was started by him, anyone else doing it would be considered a descent. But this only proves that we do not bring down, how do we know to elevate? Because the <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">first set of Tablets which was broken was nevertheless also put in the Ark</a>.<br />

Even when work is allowed, it should be done unprofessionally. On the other hand, not only baking is permitted, but building an oven or a stove is also permitted. It is a few steps removed from the food preparation for the holidays, but it represents is an exception. It is essential to enjoy the holiday.
<br />
<br />
Rava permitted a few things on the holiday weekday, depending on one's intentions. For example, suppose one is leveling the mounds of rocks and earth in his field. In that case, if he is doing it to prepare a threshing floor – it is permitted (because it is for a festival need). Still, it is forbidden if he is doing it to prepare for cultivation (and he won't enjoy the fruit of his labor this holiday). How do we know what he has in mind? By the size of the mound that he leaves over.
<br />
<br />Let us say you are cutting branches from a palm tree. If it is to feed his animals – it is allowed.&nbsp;If it promotes the tree's growth, then it is forbidden. How do we know? – If he cuts from one side only – it is for the animals. But if he is careful to cut it from all sides – he is doing this for the tree.

Moed Katan 11 – Mourning and joy

When performing this work, one should do it unusual or non-professional.
<br />
<br />
The laws of a mourner are similar: he is likewise prohibited from working, unless it leads to a loss. For example, if one softened his olives, preparing them for pressing for oil, then he must press them immediately, or else they will spoil. Therefore, if now mourning befell him, he is still allowed to load his olives and press them – but only the first pressing. This extracts most of the oil, and if the remaining olives spoil – so be it. This, however, is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yose says that he can continue pressing his olives until all oil is collected: since he is permitted to do the first pressing, he is now permitted to do the rest. 
<br />
<br />
If this happens in the middle of a festival, the law is similar on holiday weekdays (chol ha moed). Some say that the rules or a mourner are stricter: since they are only decreed by the Sages and not the Torah law, the Sages gave it even more severity so that the people should not treat mourning lightly. Others, however, maintain just the opposite and say that the decrees of the Sages (mourning) cannot be stricter than the laws of the Torah (festivals).
<br />
<br />
Mar, the son of Rav Acha, was mourning. Not only did he stop working, but he also stopped his ox from working. However, this caused loss to his partner. Rav Ashi said, "How could a great man like this do it? Because he is a partner with another, he should not cause loss to his partner!" And what was Mar's logic? – Since people look up to him, he distanced himself even from the appearance of work.

Even then, the community should provide for him. However, if he has contracted to do work before becoming a mourner, and the work cannot be postponed (such as a harvest), he can ask others to do it for him. Moreover, in cases where he cannot ask others, he can do the work. Take, for example, a donkey driver with his animal who was hired for a month of work, and if he stops the job, he will lose the complete payment and cause a loss to his employer. Since his contract allows for no substitution, he cannot ask others to do the work, and therefore he can do it himself.
<br />
<br />
During the holiday weekdays one can only do work for the Holidays. For example, he can brew beer, but only for the upcoming Holidays. However, he can make fresh beer, even if he has old one, and then change his mind and drink old beer, so that the new one will remain for after the Holidays. Some say that this kind of lie, or subterfuge, is forbidden. 
<br />
<br />
It once happened that they reaped Rav's harvest on the holiday weekdays. When Shmuel heard about it, he was upset. Why? The prevailing law is that one is permitted to harvest if it will spoil! – This was wheat, and it would not spoil. Then why did Rav allow it? – Because Rav had otherwise nothing to eat. If so, why was Shmuel upset? – Because he did not know that Rav had nothing to eat. Some say Shmuel knew that, but he considered it more proper for Rav to borrow and later repay.

For example, if he is afraid that his fruit may be stolen, he can bring them into his house. He should, however, do it privately, away from the public eye. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef had some large, heavy beams, which could not be left outdoors, and he brought them in during the day. Abaya asked him, "But we learned 'do it privately'!?" Rav Yosef answered: "This is considered private since at night I would have to hire more people and torches, so it would be even more public."
<br />
<br />
Also, one should not plan the work for the holiday weekdays, using this permission as a loophole. What happens if he planned to do it on holiday weekdays but died – is his son also penalized and prohibited from doing the work? The Talmud tries to find the answer by comparing this to other cases when a father did something wrong and died, and the son could not use the results of the father's transgression. However, these laws do not have the same strength, and the son would be allowed to finish the work, even if his father planned it for holiday weekdays and died.<br />
<br />
One should not buy homes or animals unless they are for the needs of the Holiday. However, if there is a sale, and if he misses that, he will have to pay more later, he is allowed to avail himself of the opportunity.

Why is this? By prohibiting to cut hair on the intermediate days of the festival, the Sages made sure that people come to the first day of Holidays completely prepared and with a haircut done. 
<br />
<br />
However, there are exceptions. These include, for example, one who arrived from overseas on the holiday weekdays and who therefore could not take a haircut on a trip, one who was released from prison, one who was excommunicated and whose ban was now released. 
<br />
<br />
Likewise, mourners are forbidden to cut their hair, but they are allowed to do it in the unique situations listed above. What is the connection between joy and mourning, and why are their laws so similar? – From the phrase "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3205.htm">You changed our joy to mourning</a>," we see that this change is easy, and it must be that the two states share similarities. Others say that an over-joyful person should be reminded that he, too, will die.
<br />
<br />
One is allowed to cut an infant's hair on a holiday weekday. Since this child was previously unable to do so, being in his mother's tummy – "there is no prison more than that" rule applies.<br />

Moed Katan 15 – No tefillin

How do we know that? – When the wife of Ezekiel died, God told him, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1224.htm">Put on tefillin, which is your glory</a>.” We understand from here that ordinarily a mourner is prohibited from wearing a tefillin. 
<br />
<br />
Two classes of people similar to a mourner are those excommunicated by the court and those who are metzora (spiritual leper). Can an excommunicated person wear tefillin? – The Talmud does not know the answer.
<br />
<br />
Can a metzora wear them? Since his head should be “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=13#P3095">disheveled</a>,” Rabbi Eliezer understands this as simply “no haircut.” However, Rabbi Akiva says that the same word, “disheveled,” is said about his garments, so here it must mean that his head is lacking a garment. Should we say that this means the removal of tefillin? -- Not necessarily, perhaps it means the removal of a hat or a turban. Thus, in both cases, we don't know the answer. 
<br />
<br />A mourner is also not supposed to greet others, learn Torah, launder, do work, and wear shoes. Do these laws apply to an excommunicated person and a metzora? The Talmud investigates each situation and finds answers in many cases; for example, in contrast to a mourner, the other two categories can study Torah and teach it to others.

Moed Katan 16 – Bans and excommunications
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQ1LA_-cECZQjTJ7sE2IAjUW4EKihzWKF85_SJTjOuxD0V31ni5SNbaNg0CETV0bdRSpuYrylfZ7fhK1eI80HUmZiAFbBdL6Z5PqihFFjr__Xtz-hh_f1nv-3PDiOcrSbjdoKlV7xbC8Z9/s1600/Woman+With+A+Mourning+Shawl+by+Vincent+Van+Goghl.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQ1LA_-cECZQjTJ7sE2IAjUW4EKihzWKF85_SJTjOuxD0V31ni5SNbaNg0CETV0bdRSpuYrylfZ7fhK1eI80HUmZiAFbBdL6Z5PqihFFjr__Xtz-hh_f1nv-3PDiOcrSbjdoKlV7xbC8Z9/s1600/Woman+With+A+Mourning+Shawl+by+Vincent+Van+Goghl.jpg" width="246" /></a>Having discussed the three similar categories of people: mourner, excommunicated one and metzora (spiritual leper), the Talmud discusses specifically the laws of one who is excommunicated. Here is one example. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince once decreed that Torah should not be taught in public. What was his source? – The Song of Songs, which said, “Your hidden thighs are like jewel, the work of a master's hand.” He then reasoned: just as the thigh is kept private, so the words of the Torah, the masterwork of God, should be only taught in private. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Chiya, his nephew, taught Torah in public, to two great relatives of his: Rav and Rabbah bar bar Chanah. Rabbi Yehudah heard and was upset. Rabbi Chiya went to visit him, and Rabbi Yehudah said, “Iya, who is calling you outside?” This was a derogatory name, and Rabbi Chiya understood that his uncle was upset, so he conducted himself as if he were excommunicated, for thirty days. 
<br />
<br />
On the thirtieth day, Rabbi Yehudah called for his nephew. Then he changed his mind and told him not to come. Why did he do that? At first, he thought to apply the rule, "Part of the day is like the whole day," and thus the period of excommunicated was up, but then he changed his mind. In any case, Rabbi Chiya came. Rabbi Yehudah asked, "Why did you come, seeing that I sent the second messenger for you not to come?" Rabbi Chiya said that he did not meet the second messenger. Rabbi Yehudah applied to him the verse, "When God favors a man's ways, even his foes make peace with him."
<br />
<br />
Then he asked, "Why did you teach Torah in public?" Rabbi Chiya replied that his source was "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2801.htm">Wisdom sings in the streets</a>." Rabbi Yehudah said, "You never learned it properly! It means that even if a person learns in private, his wisdom is proclaimed publicly." Even though Rabbi Chiya had a supporting phrase, how did he explain the "hidden thighs" - the source used by Rabbi Yehudah? – He thought this teaches that charity and good deeds should be private, but not Torah study.

Moed Katan 17 – The power of the Sages
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Rav Yehudah discussed with his colleagues, "What are we to do? Excommunicate him? - But he is a teacher of many students. Not to excommunicate? Covering up on him is a desecration of God's name!" Rabbah told him in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2402.htm">Teacher should be like an angel, and if not – do not study from him</a>." Based on that, they excommunicated him.
<br />
<br />
A while later, Rav Yehudah was sick, and the Sages visited him. When Rav Yehudah saw the excommunicated scholar with them, he laughed. The scholar said, "Not only you excommunicated me, but you also taunt me!" Rav Yehudah replied, "I am not laughing at you, but at the thought that when I die, I will be congratulated on not flattering even such a powerful and connected man like you."
<br />
<br />
After Rav Yehudah's death, the man came to rescind the excommunication. However, Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani, who for years has not visited the assembly, happened to come on this day and said, "How can we do it, seeing that Rav Yehudah did not make peace with him? Why, even a maidservant of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince – when she excommunicated someone, the Sages observed this for three years!" The excommunicated man left the study hall, and a bee bit him on his male organ, and he died. The burial cave of the pious did not accept him, but that of the judges – did. Why did it? – Because he would change his dress and go to faraway places when transgressing so that people would not see him misbehave openly.
<br />
<br />
And what was the story of Rabbi Yehudah's maidservant? – When she saw a man beating his grown-up son, she excommunicated him. By provoking his son to retaliate and violate the mitzvah of honoring the father, he was "putting a stumbling block in front of a blind man."

Moed Katan 18 – Nail biting
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1jn-iZdSOheEX37QlZ9f3PuPKfHwzuTNZnalzDfrYSSfdl1d7ERWY2AFhTZyZeXEZlx2AUyWiPdVojRPpgKjqG2sS9_bVAIfF-l1y73x87pEo70HgKo7g1VBWeUlLY9-vwk70ksOAhU43/s1600/Abraham+and+Isaac+By+Sir+Anthony+Van+Dyck.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1jn-iZdSOheEX37QlZ9f3PuPKfHwzuTNZnalzDfrYSSfdl1d7ERWY2AFhTZyZeXEZlx2AUyWiPdVojRPpgKjqG2sS9_bVAIfF-l1y73x87pEo70HgKo7g1VBWeUlLY9-vwk70ksOAhU43/s1600/Abraham+and+Isaac+By+Sir+Anthony+Van+Dyck.jpg" width="320" /></a>Untrimmed nails give a man an unkempt appearance. Just as the Sages prohibited one from cutting his hair on the holiday weekdays (so that one should do this before and appear groomed for the Holiday), they also prohibited pairing the nails. Others say that there is no such enactment – either because people are careful about nails and no enactment is needed or because nails grow too fast. An additional law would inconvenience people. This is where nail-biting may be helpful because one may be prohibited from using scissors but not bite or remove nails with other nails.
<br />
<br />
Since the seven days of holidays are comparable to the seven days of mourning, would the same disagreement exist about a mourner cutting his nails? Shmuel believed it does not apply on the holiday weekday or during mourning. It happened that Rav Pinchas was in mourning and did not cut his nails. Shmuel came to console him and asked why he behaved this way. Rav Pinchas retorted, “And if happened to you, would you cut them?” These words indeed came to pass, and Shmuel lost a close relative. When Rav Pinchas visited him, Shmuel threw his nails at him in anger.
<br />
<br />
How do we know that the spoken word has power? From the story of Abraham: when he was going to sacrifice his son, he said to his attendants, “We will worship, and we will come back,” and indeed, Isaac came back with him.
<br />
<br />
Having quoted a particular teacher, the Talmud brings his other statements. For example, the Pharaoh at the time of Moses was one amah (2 feet) tall; his beard was also one amah, and his member was an amah and a half. This is a metaphor.
<br />
<br />
We mentioned that only unskilled labor is permitted on holiday weekdays.&nbsp;Even that - for the purpose of the Holiday. Some consider writing to be skilled labor and prohibit it. However, in those cases where not writing will lead to a loss - it is allowed. For example, one can write an engagement document for a woman - lest someone else precedes him and snaps her away.<br />

For example, when one loans money to a friend for the needs of the Holiday, he should not require that the loan document is written. However, if he does not trust the borrower or the scribe is poor and needs the money, writing is allowed. Likewise, a scribe should not write tefillin or  a Sefer Torah. Rabbi Yehudah allowed him to write tefillin for himself – and then change his mind and sell it. And Rabbi Yose says that the enjoyment of the Holiday is more important than refraining from work – therefore, he can write tefillin and sell it, as usual, to add to his festivities.
<br />
<br />
One whose relative dies has to observe seven days of mourning after the burial – these are called "shivah"&nbsp;or "seven."&nbsp;However, if a Holiday comes during these days, his “shivah” is canceled by the joy of the holidays. 
<br />
<br />There are thirty days after "shivah" called "shloshim."&nbsp;Likewise, if a Holiday occurs during this time – that is, after shivah and until thirty days after the burial have passed – his shloshim are canceled. 
<br />
<br />
On Shabbat one does not observe any external signs of mourning – that is, he wears shoes and nice clothing, eats meat and drinks wine – and the day is counted as part of his shivah. However, unlike a Holiday, Shabbat does not cancel the mourning, only suspends it.

Moed Katan 2 – Limiting the work

The last day is also a Yom Tov. The five intermediate days are called "holiday weekdays" between the first and the last Yom Tov. On these days, work is permitted, but it is limited - thus adding to the enjoyment of the holidays.<br />
<br />
What are these limitations, and what kind of work should not be done on holiday weekdays? In general, only work that leads to losses if not performed – only such work is allowed. Moreover, even when saving his crop from ruin, the farmer cannot work too much.<br />
<br />
Take, for example, a field. If this field is usually irrigated by rain, one should not water it during the weekdays. The crop in this field can survive without his additional water, so watering it would only lead to further growth, and that is not reason enough to work. On the other hand, if his field is high up in the mountains, it depends on watering. Without this, his crop would be ruined. Then the farmer is allowed to water it.<br />
<br />
Even so, one cannot work too hard. One can use a spring and divert its water to the field. However, he cannot draw water from a well because this requires much more exertion.<br />
<br />
The two additional limitations are the view of Rabbi Yehudah. There are, however, other views, which take away both of the "preventing loss" and "not working too much" limitations for the holiday weekdays - and that is the view of Rabbi Meir.<br />
<br />

Rabbi Chiya said to his attendant, "Help me take off my shoes and carry my clothing after me to the bathhouse."</p><p>From the words of Rabbi Chiya, we learned three laws. First, a mourner is prohibited from wearing shoes. In the case of Rabbi Chiya, it was "delayed news," so he only had to take his shoes off for a short time. Second, in the case of delayed news, a mourner observes the shivah only for a day and not seven days. Therefore, even though usually a mourner is prohibited from bathing, Rabbi Chiya was allowed to bathe after a day. And third, part of the day is counted as a full day, and Rabbi Chiya already demonstrated his mourning by taking off the shoes.</p><p>Peasant Burial by Erik Werenskiold</p>

This bereavement lasts until the burial - which ideally should be on the day of death.<p></p><p>With the closing of the casket begins the "shivah," which lasts for seven days. When the body is buried without a coffin, shiva starts with the closing of the grave. If the body is taken to a different city, those mourners who do not accompany the body begin shivah as soon as they take leave of the body.</p><p>Burying and mourning for one's parents are different from the other close relatives. For all other relatives, the sooner he buries them - the better. For his father and mother, one who eulogizes them is praiseworthy. In the former times, the pallbearers would stop many times on the way, and at each stop, some additional eulogizing and mourning would take place.</p><p>Art: Mourning by Jules Charles Boquet</p><div><br /></div>

Moed Katan 28 – Honor for the dead

The biers of women are not set down but rather proceed directly to the grave. The source for this law is the phrase. "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=20">Miriam died there and was buried there</a>" - That is, right away.<br />
<br />
Why is Miriam's death mentioned next to the story of the red heifer? Compare the two: just as red heifer provides atonement, so the end of the righteous provides atonement. Similarly, the death of Aharon is mentioned next to the priestly garments. These garments also provided atonement – each for a specific wrongdoing.<br />
<br />
Rav said: "The length of one's life, his material success and the number of his children does not depend on his merit, but rather on luck." Others say that prayer and good deeds can change one's luck for the better.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then recounts the stories of various Sages meeting the Angel of Death. For some, it was as easy as a puncture of the skin. For others – like a hair drawn from milk. How do we know? Dead don't come back to life! These particular Sages made a pact to communicate this back to their living friends. The one who died like "hair from milk" added that if God told him to go back to life, he would still refuse because of the fear of the Angel of Death.

Moed Katan 29 – But in the future death will be erased

Those expressions were elegy – when all chant together, and lamentation – when one woman speaks, and the others respond after her. However, in the future, "<a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1025.htm" target="_blank">He will remove death forever, and God the Lord will erase tears from all faces</a>."
<br />
<br />
When the sons of Rabbi Yishmael died, the Sages came to console him. He started first and lamented that his bereavements came in close succession, and he has bothered his teachers twice to go and comfort him (which emphasized the tragedy). Rabbi Tarfon compared the sons of Rabbi Yishmael to the two sons of Aharon and derived that the sons of Rabbi Yishmael will be accorded even more tremendous honor. Rabbi Akiva spoke last and said, "If king Achav, who only did one good thing, was accorded great honor, then the son of Rabbi Yishmael – how much greater honor they will have!"
<br />
<br />
When one takes leave of the dead in a cemetery, he says to him, "Go in peace," but when he parts from the living, he wishes them "Go to peace," because they can consistently achieve more significant spiritual elevation while they are still alive. By contrast, the Sages don't have rest even in the World to Come; the Torah study, which occupied them in this world, continues there.

For instance, the farmer cannot draw water for his field, neither from water wells nor from pools of rainwater.
<br />
<br />
We understand that drawing water from a well using a pail requires exertion. However, what's the problem with the pool of rainwater? It should be easy to trace a path for the water with one's foot and let it flow from the reservoir into the field. – The Sages simply prohibited both together so that people would not make the wrong deduction. Others say the pool of rainwater may eventually dry out and require a pail. They argue about whether water may or may not dry out.
<br />
<br />
There is one exception for the above rules: one may bring up (water with a pail) for the vegetables, to eat them on the Holidays. Ravina and Rabbah were traveling along the road on a particular holiday weekday, and they saw a man who was drawing water with a pail and watering his vegetable patch. Rabbah said to Ravina, "Let's excommunicate him for violating the law!" Ravina answered, "but we may draw up for vegetables in order to eat them." Rabbah asked, "Is that how you understand 'bring up'? No! - This means, thinning out the vegetable by 'bringing up' the extra ones, which don't let the others to grow." Ravina showed him an example where "bringing up" meant bringing up water, and Rabbah said, "I agree with your proof and retract my opinion."

For example, one can repair the roads and mark the graves.
<br />
<br />
It was customary to mark graves with lime so that those eating the priestly portion (terumah) would stay away and not become ritually impure. One of the hints for this custom is in the words of Ezekiel, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1239.htm">When one sees a human bone, he will make a marker near it</a>.” (Ezekiel was talking about the soldiers of the army of Gog). The Talmud quotes many other allusions to this custom.
<br />
<br />
The markers were made at some distance from the grave. It helped the passers-by not step on the place of ritual impurity. However, the grave markers were not placed too far to not take away from the land where one can travel safely. Cemeteries need not be marked because their boundaries were obvious. Alleys leading to them might be labeled since occasionally people could be on the way to bury their dead, run out of time, due either to nightfall or to the approach of Shabbat, and bury the dead in such an alley.

Why would joy be a problem? – Precisely because the Festivals are already joyful occasions, and one should not mix one joy with another. Some say – because to make his wedding a joyful occasion, he will exert himself too much. Yet others explain that if marriages were allowed on the Festivals, then people might postpone their weddings until the Festivals to save on preparations, thus delaying the commandment to be fruitful and multiply.
<br />
<br />
If one has to mend or make his clothing for the sake of the Holiday, and he is not a professional tailor, he can sew the way he usually does. However, if he is a professional, he should sew with irregular stitches. This distinction between an unskilled worker and a professional applies to other works on holiday weekdays.

Nazir 14 – Nazir because of the birth of a son

If a son is born to him before he completes his own period of nazir (which he did not expect), then he completes his own, and after that, he becomes nazir for the birth of his son.
<br />
<br />
However, if he says, “I will be a nazir when I have a son born to me, and I am also a nazir now,” – then he indeed becomes a nazir now. But when a son is born to him, he sets aside his own time of nazir behavior and starts the one which he promised for the birth of his son. He completes that and then resumes his own counting of nazir's days. This is because he fully expected that his son would be born to him before his own nazir period was completed.
<br />
<br />
A question comes up: at the end of his son's nazir  period, he is supposed to shave his head, like he does at the end of every nazir period, but he should not do it – because he is now back to his own nazir – and as such he is not allowed to touch his hair. Here there are two points of view. The Talmud then discussed combinations of various nazir periods, overlapping and taken for various lengths.

Nazir 19 – Deriving different things from the same word

Suppose he accidentally  comes in contact with a dead body and thus becomes ritually impure. In that case, he needs to purify himself, shave all his hair, bring sacrifices, and restart being a nazir. Say he became impure again the night before he could bring the sacrifices. Then later, he will need to bring two sets of sacrifices. Why? – The Torah said, "He shall sanctify his head on that day and restart being a nazir" – even if he did not bring his sacrifices yet. Thus the new impurity happens to a fresh new nazir and causes another obligation.<br />
<br />
This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. It results in bringing the most sacrifices. The Sages also pay attention to the extra words of "on that day," but it teaches them that that he does not restart his being a nazir until he brings the guilt offering. Thus, right now, he has not started another term yet and just needs to purify himself. This is all one long period of impurity, and later he brings only one set of sacrifices. 
<br />
<br />
This seems to cover all possibilities. But Rabbi Ishmael says something else: if he did not bring all sacrifices, including the burnt offering, he is still not a nazir again. Until then, he only brings one set of sacrifices when he finishes being a nazir. 
<br />
<br />
Practical law? – Follow what the Sages have said since they are the majority.

Nazir 2 – What is a nazir?

It is wrong to become a nazir as self-punishment. Instead, if one chooses to become a nazir, it should be for self-improvement, and such a one is called “Holy to God.”
<br />
<br />
To become a nazir, one must make a declaration to this effect and entirely mean in. One does not become a nazir by mistake. If he changes his wording, and instead of “nazir,” says, for example, “nazik” – since this was a common form these days – he would also become a nazir.
<br />
<br />
Finally, if one makes an incomplete statement, such as “I will become...” and does not conclude, but there is enough evidence to what he really means, for example, by a nazir passing by and him pointing at this nazir – this is also effective.

What should she do with them?
<br />
<br />
If the animal is from the husband's flock, it can go back to graze. The husband implicitly gives permission to his wife to use the animals – but only if she indeed has to bring a sacrifice. If, on the other hand, she used her own animals, then there is no way out, and the sin offering will have to remain in this state until it dies. What about the money she separated for the libations? – It should be dropped into the communal collection box in the Temple. 
<br />
<br />
What happens if she separates metal pieces (ingots)? Such pieces were used for trading for animals and then used for metal works. The same questions would arise if one separated the ingots for his being a nazir but did not specify how they should be used and then died. Since these ingots require appraisal and cannot be readily sold, they remain in their unresolved state and should be destroyed to avoid confusion. That is what the Sages say. However, Rav Nachman disagreed. One can easily barter the ingots for animals and then sell the animals. Therefore, they are equivalent to cash. And just as cash should be deposited into communal boxes for voluntary offerings, so too the ingots should be disposed of in the same manner.

Nazir 28 – A wife must drink with her husband
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3DFO70RKT_E55e1nN_4YUll2oWsNXZ2iVLNXNPeh5i9lJ0uDju3SvhyIZnrA7E07K3swEnL7YDE_7HYa069DtiztMVhE-iLtr2TwwmARvo8cI38CGyCv8b-w9FgbefUMWZVAlRuVNit7m/s1600/Young+Woman+with+a+Wine+Glass+by+Octave+Tassaert.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3DFO70RKT_E55e1nN_4YUll2oWsNXZ2iVLNXNPeh5i9lJ0uDju3SvhyIZnrA7E07K3swEnL7YDE_7HYa069DtiztMVhE-iLtr2TwwmARvo8cI38CGyCv8b-w9FgbefUMWZVAlRuVNit7m/s320/Young+Woman+with+a+Wine+Glass+by+Octave+Tassaert.jpg" width="240" /></a>If a husband hears of his wife's vow, he can annul it – but only on the day he hears it. If he heard of his wife becoming a nazir (or "nazirah") on the last day of her vow, he can annul it then. However, if the blood of one of the required sacrifices was already thrown on the Altar, he cannot annul it any longer – because from then on, she is not deprived of anything and can drink wine and go to the cemetery. His  rights extend only to her self-deprivation, but not further.
<br />
<br />
This is true, however, if she concluded her promised time of being a nazirah correctly. Suppose she accidentally touched a dead body and is bringing sacrifices because of that. In that case, he can still annul the vow so that she does not continue her period of abstinence because he can demand that she drink wine with him.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that even if she did everything right, he can stop it at the last moment – because he can claim, "I don't want my wife to shave off her hair!" (which every nazir finally does). And the first teacher, what did he think? – That she can wear a wig. And Rabbi Meir? – That the husband won't like the wig.
<br />
<br />
The father can declare his son a nazir. However, his son or any relative can stop that and free the son from the obligation. Another unusual law (known only to those who study unwritten Torah): if the father was a nazir and prepared money for his concluding sacrifices but died, the son can use that money for his own nazir sacrifice. This is not true for any other type of sacrifice or money – they cannot be re-used by the son.

Nazir 29 – Father and son, a nazir

This can only be true if the son is not grown up because the father would have no rights over his son's religious observances after that. Only if the son is young and the father feels that this would be a proper measure for his son's education could such a law be possible.
<br />
<br />
And yet, who mandated it? Was it the Torah that made a notable exception to its usual rules? Or did the Sages decide to give this additional power to the father? If it is the Torah, then we will not question, for example, why it gave this power to the father but not to the mother. This is indeed the view of Rabbi Yochanan. However, Resh Lakish ascribes the rule to the Sages. Now Resh Lakish will have to explain every detail of this enactment. First, he answers that only the father, not the mother, is responsible for the son's observances. 
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, why did the Sages establish that relatives can annul this father's decree? – Because if the relatives teach the boy to negate the father's command, it is hardly conducive to proper education. But how did the Sages allow to shave off the hair on the head? Isn't it prohibited to shave off the peyot? Resh Lakish will tell you that shaving the whole head is permitted. And yet, how can the Sages permit an animal sacrifice of a nazir if it is not needed!? – Resh Lakish will answer that it is actually permitted to bring unnecessary sacrifices<br />
<br />
The father of (future) Rabbi Chanina pronounced his son Chanina a nazir, and they took the boy to Rabban Gamliel to examine if he was still a child. But Chanina said, “Please do not trouble yourself. If I am still a minor, I do what my father says. And if I am a grownup, then I declare myself a nazir.” 
<br />
<br />
Rabban Gamliel kissed Chanina on the forehead and predicted that he would be a great Sages, which soon came to pass.

Nazir 3 – Proximity search

Since talking about Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel says that "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3404.htm">His hair has grown like the feathers of an eagle</a>" the person does a mental proximity search and, finding the two words "hair" and "eagle" (bird) close, he means the hair of a nazir  when he refers to birds – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that he is not a nazir because people do not do such proximity searches in their heads.
<br />
<br />
This explanation is hard to accept, though – not everybody is so knowledgeable. It could be that nobody does such searches. Instead, the man meant those birds that a nazir needs to bring if he becomes ritually impure – and this explains why Rabbi Meir says that he becomes a nazir. But perhaps he meant to pay for the bird sacrifice for someone else but not become a nazir himself? – We have to say that a nazir was passing before him.
<br />
<br />
The Sages, however, consider all these explanations of the point of view of Rabbi Meir as forced and say that the man does not become a nazir by promising a bird sacrifice.

<br />
<br />
This rule was taught by God to Moses on Sinai and has not been recorded in the Torah. But what is its logic? Is it an exception to all rules, or does it work as an inheritance? And if you say that a daughter would not share in the inheritance anyway, what if the man has only one daughter? Can she become a nazir (nazirah) and use her father's money? The rule above tells us that only a son can do so.
<br />
<br />
And yet we can ask another question. If there are many sons, do they equally share in this money? If one of the sons is a firstborn, does he get the double portion? And furthermore, is this rule valid only for a regular nazir? What about a lifetime nazir or a Samson-like nazir? – To all these questions, the Sages did not find an answer.

Nazir 31 – Mistakes

Will the white ox become a sacrifice? 
<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai says that, indeed, it will. Why? Because Beit Shammai claims that even done by mistake, consecrations are still valid. One cannot undo a consecration to the Temple if done by mistake. Another explanation is that he really made no mistake. He planned for the first ox to become sacred. To emphasize, he specified that it would be black (as this was more valuable to him). But even if a white one comes out first – it will become sacred, and the color does not matter. 
<br />
<br />
Which reason is the real one? Do his mistakes become consecrations, or do we simply reinterpret his words to make sense? The Talmud tries to derive the answer from the rule above, but to every proof, it finds an exception disproving it. Thus, the question remains unresolved – in this particular discussion.
<br />
<br />Beit Hillel states that his statement&nbsp;must&nbsp;agree precisely with the intended effect, and his consecration becomes valid only then.<br />

However, the Sages imposed upon him a penalty: he cannot even ask about annulment until he behaves appropriately for as many days as he previously violated by drinking wine. Suppose a Sage annulled his vow of being a nazir, and he already separated an animal for the concluding sacrifices. In that case, we are back to the argument between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel simply allow the animal to go back to its flock.
<br />
<br />
If one thought that he had an animal to conclude his nazir's vow and declared himself a nazir, but then discovered that the animal was stolen – if it was stolen before the vow, then he is not a nazir. If it was stolen after his vow, then he was a valid nazir for the time the animal was still in his possession, so his vow is valid.
<br />
<br />
Nachum HaMede made this mistake: he annulled all nazir vows for people who made them close to the  Temple destruction. The Sages corrected him: if they vowed before the destruction, their vows were, in fact, valid. But they knew the Second Temple would be destroyed 490 (<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3410.htm">seventy weeks</a> ) years after the first one, so how could they vow in earnest?! – They still hoped their period of being a nazir would finish while the Temple stood.

The first said, "I am a nazir if this is John." The second one said, "I am nazir if this is not John." The third one said to the first two - "I am a nazir if one of you is now a nazir." The fourth one said, "I am a nazir if one of you two is not a nazir." The fifth one said, "I am a nazir if both of you are nazirim." And the sixth said – talking to all five – "I am a nazir that you are all nazirim." What is their status?
<br />
<br />
1) Beit Shammai says that they are all nazirim. They all wanted to become nazirim and added their qualifications as a by-the-way, but not essential to their vow.
<br />
<br />
2) Beit Hillel said that only those with fulfilled conditions become nazirim. This is the most straightforward logic.
<br />
<br />
3) Rabbi Tarfon says that nobody is a nazir. A conditional vow does not make a nazir; it must be clear and direct.
<br />
<br />
If now the person in question suddenly turned back, and they never found out who he was, what is their status then?
<br />
<br />
4) Rabbi Yehudah says that no one becomes a nazir because a person never accepts to be a nazir out of doubt.
<br />
<br />
5) Rabbi Shimon says that he has a real problem: he is a nazir out of doubt, but cannot get out of this because only a real nazir is allowed to shave his head, so if he is not a nazir, he cannot complete his vow. Therefore, he should declare: "If I am a real nazir – well and good, but if not, I am now become one out of my free will."<br />

Nazir 39 – The direction of hair growth

This is because the standard (and the minimal) term is thirty days, and when he shaves his hair, it must have at least thirty days of growth.
<br />
<br />
A question: is the hair growing from the root or the end? Why would we want to know? – If the hair is growing from its root, and the bandits gave him a haircut but left seven days' worth of hair growth on his head – does he now wait for thirty days still, or only for twenty-three? For example, if the hair grows from the root, then that hair he consecrated has grown down by now and was cut by the bandits, so he will have to wait another thirty days. But if the hair grows from the end down, then he will only need twenty-three days. So?
<br />
<br />
Let's look at a nit (louse). It always remains at the root – so it must be that the hair grows from the end! – Not so fast! Maybe the nit is alive and keeps crawling to the root. Well, let's look at a dead nit – it is always found at the end of the hair, so it must grow from the root! – No, because perhaps when the nit is dead and cannot resist gravity, it keeps sliding down as the hair grows. 
<br />
<br />
The final proof comes from the beards of old men who die them black. We see that the whitish color of gray hair appears at the root – so it is proven that it grows from the root!<br />

If one accepts to be a nazir and to abstain only from grapes – he is a complete nazir, with all the prohibitions. Since the Torah forbade separately "...from new wine and aged wine," we see that partial prohibition has the force to impose a complete nazir vow on him. 
<br />
<br />
The above is the view of the Sages. Rabbi Shimon disagrees: since the Torah said, "From anything made of grapevine," we see that only a complete declaration takes effect. Each disputant, the Sages and Rabbi Shimon, then explains away the other one's proof.
<br />
<br />
One can become a "nazir like Samson" or even just a "permanent nazir." The permanent nazir observes the laws of wine, ritual impurity, and not cutting hair all his life. However, if his hair is too heavy, he can trim it – and bring sacrifices – then continue. "Nazir like Samson" cannot cut his hair at all, but on the other hand, he is not bringing sacrifice even if he becomes impure – he just purifies himself and continues. Others say that "Nazir like Samson" does not exist – because Samson never became a nazir himself. 
<br />
<br />
The categories of "Nazir like Samsom" and "permanent nazir" are nowhere mentioned in the Torah but constitute part of "unwritten laws." These were initially taught only from teacher to student and later recorded.

Nazir 40 – Real shaving is done with a razor
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip7d8pcKO0FnwM1ilbY2A-gE0oTYV6VbMV9FclV-cVB6__hZZAM7u_UxYybtf7qYw6Fw7KSbUhWvG_fFZaW_FDjA-XBXytaXZNbdiwPUAucyG0KjGEV6Zy9TN_DeDauVRw2HWN46RLIH5R/s1600/Portrait+of+a+Clean-shaven+Man+by+Lucas+The+Elder+Cranach.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip7d8pcKO0FnwM1ilbY2A-gE0oTYV6VbMV9FclV-cVB6__hZZAM7u_UxYybtf7qYw6Fw7KSbUhWvG_fFZaW_FDjA-XBXytaXZNbdiwPUAucyG0KjGEV6Zy9TN_DeDauVRw2HWN46RLIH5R/s320/Portrait+of+a+Clean-shaven+Man+by+Lucas+The+Elder+Cranach.jpg" width="220" /></a>The Torah said about a nazir that a "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=6#P3826">razor shall not pass over his head</a>." However, the words "razor" or really "no razor" is already sufficient for us to know the law. Then why are the words "will not pass over his head" written at all? – to include any other way of hair removal, such as pincers or depilatory, and to make it prohibited for nazir to remove his hair in any way. 
<br />
<br />
But now the word "razor" becomes extra: if, in the end, the Torah is going to prohibit all kinds of hair removal, then why mention "razor?" Now, this teaches an additional law: that when the nazir concludes his term and shaves his head, that shaving must be done only with a razor. If he uses any other instrument, the shaving does not count; he has to re-do the last thirty days of a nazir and shave again, this time correctly. 
<br />
<br />
There are, in general, three categories of people who must shave all their hair: a nazir, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath">metzora</a> (spiritual leper), and all Levites on the day of their first inauguration  for Temple service. The Talmud tries to derive the laws of one of these categories from the others.

Nazir 43 - How to get multiple punishments

However, if they warn him again before every sip, he is liable (to lashes) for each separate act.<br />
<br />
Similarly, if they tell him not to become ritually impure by coming in contact with a dead body, and he does it, he is liable only once. Still, he is liable multiple times if they keep warning him before each act.<br />
<br />
But how can one be liable for ritual impurity more than once? Once he is impure - that's it, and he cannot become any more impure than this!? - He can achieve it by coming into a house where there is a dead body (for this is a separate prohibition) and then actually becoming impure.<br />
<br />
However, this is not possible. If his nose comes in first, he is already impure but has not entirely come into the house. And if he leans back, so his nose is in line with his body, his toe comes in first!<br />
<br />
We can invent a solution: he should come in while in a big box, since big boxes protect from impurity. And then somebody must remove the roof of his box. For this, he really does get punished twice - provided that he assists in removing the roof, for otherwise, it is not he but the one who removed the roof would be to blame. Thus, we found an answer.<br />

Nazir 47 – Who is more important, nazir or High Priest?

And yet, if any of them finds an unattended corpse so that the obligation to bury the body devolves on him, he should attend to it, even though he will become ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
What if a High Priest and a nazir find this corpse together – who is obligated to bury this dead and thus preserve the other one from becoming impure? This should be the High Priest because to purify himself, he only needs to wait for seven days and get himself sprinkled with the ashes of the Red Heifer. By contrast, a nazir would need to bring special sacrifices before he can restart being a nazir. This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Sages say just the opposite. Nazir should bury because his limitations are temporary, whereas the High Priest should always be pure.
<br />
<br />
In this argument, the positions are clearly stated. But now the Talmud compares other gradations, such as the Priest Anointed for War and a Deputy High Priest; who is more important? This is resolved as follows: to preserve the life of the Priest Anointed for War, he is more critical because he serves the needs of many people. But concerning purity, the Deputy is more important concerning purity because he can be called to serve in the Temple any time the chief High Priest becomes impure.

Nazir 52 – Skull and spine

If a nazir comes in touch with a dead body, he loses his previous days, has to shave, must bring sacrifices, and then restart. How much of a dead body? One example is a skull and spine – just bones, even if they have no meat.
<br />
<br />This rule had two versions; one read "skull and spine," but the other read "skull or spine." According to the second one, a skull or a spine is enough for a nazir to lose his days and shave. Which one is right?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries to resolve this in many ways. For example, since there are six questions related to nazir where Rabbi Akiva initially held a more stringent position but eventually conceded to the Sages, if his position was more stringent here, too, and read "skull or spine," - then the total count would be seven, not six. However, Rabbi Shimon says there was another rule about a "quarter-measurement of blood from two different deads," which Rabbi Akiva never conceded. This changes the count and ruins our proof.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, Rabbi Shimon emphasized his points: "While Rabbi Akiva was alive, he never changed his mind on this question, and whether he retracted after death - I don't know about that." Unfortunately, there were more refined ways of putting it. Rabbi Shimon felt remorse and fasted to atone for it until his teeth darkened.

Nazir 54 – Not to shave!

There are cases when the ritual impurity does not really exist, but it was “decreed by the Sages.” Take, for example, a field where a grave was previously located, then the location of it was lost, and then the field was plowed over. Since anyone who is walking through the field can potentially touch a bone and become impure, the Sages said that such a field should be treated as ritually impure, and anyone who went through it without precautions will have to purify himself.
<br />
<br />
However, from the Torah point of view, accidentally touching a bone is unlikely because a plow does not usually reach that deep, and the person is really pure. A nazir who becomes impure should cut his hair and bring sacrifices, but a nazir who is pure is not allowed to touch even one hair. What is a nazir to do if he passes through a “field full of fragments," as it is called?
<br />
<br />
Here is what he should do: purify himself with the ashes of the red heifer on days three and seven, and then continue being a nazir. The seven days of his impurity are removed from his count, but otherwise, he continues to count as before. And he does not shave his hair or bring sacrifices because, in truth, he is pure. Other similar cases, such as being under the same branch as a corpse (but not a real roof that transmits impurity) are treated the same way.
<br />
<br />
If, in addition to being a nazir, he became a metzora (spiritual leper), he purifies himself from that but continues being a nazir since metzora, even though it requires purification, is not the same as the impurity of the dead. Thus, he does not lose all the previous days, as he would if we were to go to a cemetery.

Nazir 55 – Nazir outside of Israel?

Ostensibly, this is because people who live outside of Israel are not as careful marking off graves (ground-based impurity), and one can pass over an unknown grave. However, the Sages may have declared the airspace outside Israel impure (air-based impurity).
<br />
<br />
The laws of nazir may shed some light on this. A nazir who went outside of Israel becomes ritually impure and will have to continue his days after he purifies himself. We also saw that he purifies himself with the ashes of Red Heifer. Now, the ashes are only needed for the impurity of the dead. This proves that the out-of-Israel impurity was because of the unmarked graves, and it is a ground-based impurity, does it not? – Actually, no. It could be that this is sheer air-based impurity, and the ashes of the Red Heifer are mentioned only regarding a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/10/nazir-54-not-to-shave.html">plowed-over cemetery</a>&nbsp;but not anything else.

Nazir 57 – One out of two nazirs

The impure one must shave and bring sacrifices to purify himself, and the pure one simply continues being a nazir. But they don't know who is who.<br />
<br />
Here is their way out. They both continue being nazir until the end of their term. Then they both shave because it would be required for both pure and impure nazir. Then they take two sets of sacrifices, one for a nazir who is pure, and another, a different set, for one who is impure, and bring them together to the Temple. 
<br />
<br />
Each of them now says: "If I am really pure, and my friend is impure, then the sacrifices of purity are mine, and the other set is his." Then they bring both sets. But this works only for a pure nazir. Now they continue for yet another thirty days, and at the end, they bring just one set of sacrifices – for the nazir who is pure. Each one says: "If I was the pure one – then this sacrifice is my friend's, and previously my sacrifice was already brought. But if I was the impure one, then this sacrifice is now mine."<br />
<br />
The Talmud then asks: why is there any doubt at all? We know how to resolve all such doubts based on the laws of the doubts of a suspected wife (next Tractate). That is, if the suspected people hid, the doubt is confirmed. And if they were in a public place, there is no doubt at all. Here they did not hide from the one who saw them!? – He was far, so it is as if they were hiding.

Continuing the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/10/nazir-57-one-out-of-two-nazirs.html">story of two nazirs</a>, one who became ritually impure and had to bring sacrifices together, making conditional statements about whose sacrifice it was, let us suppose that one of them dies. Now the surviving one does not have a friend with whom to make those conditions. What is he to do?
<br />
<br />
He must find someone "in the street" willing to help. This volunteer has to put himself in a condition of doubt by saying,  "I adopt to be a nazir, but conditionally. If the survivor was impure, I am a nazir immediately." After thirty days, they bring the same two sets of sacrifices, one required for a pure nazir and one for an impure one, and declare that if the survivor was impure, then the impure sacrifices are his, and the other ones are for the volunteer. But if the survivor was pure, the pure sacrifices are his, and the impure ones are offered as sacrifices in doubt (since such a category exists). Then the volunteer continues, "If the surviving nazir was pure, then my term of being a nazir starts after thirty days." Then they keep offering more sacrifices and making more conditions.
<br />
<br />
This was the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua. But Ben  Zome asked, "Who will go out to this extent to extricate his friend out of his doubts?" Rather, the survivor should bring the minimal sacrifice that would allow him to conclude his being a nazir, even though they involve bird sacrifices, which is not standard - but it will enable him to achieve his purpose. Even though Rabbi Yehoshua argued that this was not the preferred way, the Sages agreed to Ben Zoma as more practical.
<br />
<br />
A question to Rabbi Yehoshua: "What is really wrong with Ben Zoma's solution?" - Actually, nothing; Rabbi Yehoshua just wanted to sharpen the minds of his students with a more complicated one.<br />

A Jewish man can become a nazir, but a non-Jew cannot. Also, a Jewish woman can become a nazir (nazirah), and one can even force his slave to become a nazir.
<br />
<br />
All three rules above are not obvious. Why is it that a non-Jew cannot become a nazir? – Because the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=6#P3823">Speak to the sons of Israel</a>," but not to other peoples. However, this cannot serve as proof because later, the Torah uses the term "man," which should mean "any man." In fact, a non-Jew can bring sacrifices in the Temple, so why can't  he be a nazir?
<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is because a nazir is not allowed to bury even his father, and maybe for a non-Jew, it is different? – Can't be because inheritance laws apply to all people, including inheriting from the father. Or perhaps it is because a nazir should avoid impurity, and a non-Jew, since he does not go to the Temple and does not have the concept of impurity, cannot be a nazir? – No, that is not convincing either: perhaps he does have a concept of impurity, just that he gets no punishment for being impure!?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries a few more attempts but concludes that this rule is impossible to prove. Rabbi Yochanan summarized that God tells this law directly to Moses and not written anywhere in the Torah.

Nazir 62 – Willing slaves

A slave acquired by a Jew has to undergo circumcision and accept on himself the majority of the mitzvot: he will be obligated to keep all the "don't do” prohibitions but not all of the “do” commandments. Thus, his obligations are the same as a Jewish woman keeps.
<br />
<br />
What happens if a slave does not want to undergo circumcision or accept the commandments? – The master can keep him for a year to see if he changes his mind, but afterward, must sell him back.
<br />
<br />
Another uncommon feature of such slaves is that if the master accidentally or intentionally kicks out his tooth, eye, or finger, the slave goes to freedom. Once any slave acquires his freedom – he cannot be made a slave again. In fact, he becomes a full Jew, with the additional mitzvot of a Jewish man.
<br />
<br />
There is a difference between the laws of nazir for women and for slaves. For a woman, a husband can annul her vow, particularly of becoming a nazir (nazirah). The annulment is still active if they divorce or if the husband dies. However, with the slave, it is not so. While the master can force the slave to drink wine and go to a cemetery, this does not cancel the vow; when the slave goes free, he needs to complete his term of nazir.

Nazir 66 – Is it better to bless or to be blessed?

About Samuel the prophet, it says that a <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a01.htm">razor ("morah") will not pass over his hair</a>. This means that he was a nazir, just like Simeon, about whom the same is said. This is the opinion of Rabbi Nehorai. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yose translates the word “morah” as fear and says that fear of man would never be upon Samuel. To this, Rabbi Nehorai replies that Samuel was afraid once when he said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b16.htm">What if the king hears and kills me?</a>” The answer of Rabbi Nehorai is not given here.
<br />
<br />
The same Sages agree on something else, though. Rabbi Yose says that the one who responds with “Amen” (which signals his agreement to the blessing) is greater than the one who says the blessing. Rabbi Nehorai said, “By Heaven, so it is! Look at a battle: regular soldiers start, but champions seal the battle.” And yet, another Sage disagrees and says that one should rush to say the blessing first because he is then blessed from Heaven first – and afterward, the one who answers “Amen” receives the same reward (but not greater). 
<br />
<br />
And talking about battles, Sages, through their Torah study, increase peace in the world since their war of arguments substitutes for the physical conflict.

Being a nazir  means specifically abstaining from grapes, nothing else. However, Beit Shammai says that he does become a nazir nevertheless. How so? People usually do not make nonsensical statements. This one probably wanted to become a nazir but added that he meant figs. He could have made a mistake, thinking there was such a thing. Or, he really could have changed his mind and was preparing a loophole for himself. But the problem is that Beit Shammai does not accept the idea of changing one's mind regarding Temple-related things. So either way, he becomes a nazir.
<br />
<br />
What about Beit Hillel? They say that the man is not a nazir. He made a statement, that is true, but it was not a valid legal statement about becoming a nazir. So it did not take effect at all.

Better do something good without a promise, or at least promise right before the deed. For this reason, a Nazir is called “a transgressor” - because he abstains from wine, which is wrong. Now, if just for not drinking wine one is called a sinner, how much more so is one who afflicts himself with unnecessary deprivations and fasts.
<br />
<br />
If one does decide to make a vow, he has a choice of many words to use, “konam,” “konach,” “konas.” These were created by the Sages so that one should not use the word “korban” (sacrifice). But why not use the word “korban?” – Because he may say, “Korban to God.” But let him say that! – Because he may say just “To God,” thus using the name of God for no purpose. This all is the view of Resh Lakish.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yochanan says these terms translate the word “korban” into foreign languages. These words are adequate only if the user or those around him understand this language.

For example, if one says, “It is not kosher what I eat of yours!” – he has, in fact, forbidden himself the food coming from his fellow, and it would be counted as if he violated the Torah if he did eat it.
<br />
<br />
He can also say, “It is not regular (chulin) food,” “not clean,” or “like the remainder of a sacrifice” (which can not be eaten).
<br />
<br />
However, watch for provisos and caveats: if one says, “It is not kosher what I do not eat of yours,” then he means that what he does NOT eat will be not kosher, but what he DOES eat will be kosher, and thus he created no vow and no prohibition.

He can instead say, "This, to me, is like that." For example, if he says, "This bread to me is like the meat of a disqualified offering," – he is then forbidden to eat this bread.
<br />
<br />
Rami bar Chama asked a question: if one says, "This bread to me is like the meat of a peace offering," – what happens then? For most of the lifetime of the peace offering, it is prohibited to eat, so maybe his vow takes effect. But in the end, after its blood has been thrown on the Altar, the meat is eaten by people and guests, so maybe he meant this permitted state, and therefore the vow effects no prohibition?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries to compare this case to various others, where the answer is known but still does not come with a resolution.

The Torah said, "One who vows a vow..." – why did it have to repeat the word? To teach us that if one connects his vow to some other prohibited thing, this thing must become prohibited through a declaration and not be already prohibited. For example, he can say, "This is like a sacrifice to me," because an animal is not born a sacrifice, but rather someone designates it so. If he says, by contrast, "This is like a firstborn (animal) to me," then no vow is created because a firstborn becomes consecrated as a sacrifice at birth by itself. Some make exceptions only for the firstborn, but the rule holds true otherwise.
<br />
<br />
Another essential rule to remember: vows are valid only for material objects. For example, one cannot say, "I vow not to talk to you," but he can say, "I vow for my mouth not to talk to you."

He can use the words, “I am making a vow (neder),” but he can also say, “This is prohibited to me as  a sacrifice (“korban”). He can use a synonym, such as “konam” instead of a “korban.” Finally, he can say an incomplete vow, such as “I am separated from you” or “I am distanced from you,” and as a result, he will not be able to derive any benefit from his fellow who was the subject of his vow.
<br />
<br />
The same rule applies to oaths as well. But how is an oath different from a vow? – Vow is usually directed at an object (bread), but an oath talks about the person's action (eating this bread).
<br />
<br />
For the following ten pages, we will discuss incomplete vows, and now the Talmud discusses why the teacher chose to discuss incomplete vows, which were mentioned last, and not synonyms, which were mentioned first. Examples of word sequences are brought from all areas of law, such as adornments that women can wear on Shabbat, flour sacrifices in the Temple, and inheritance laws.

He gave the following advice: one who wants to press his friend to eat with him should say, "Any vows that I will make will be void," and then tell his friend, "I vow that you will eat with me."
<br />
<br />
But this could not be: once his friend hears the annulment, he will pay no attention to his vow and surely won't eat with him!
<br />
<br />
Instead, Rabbi Elazar was hiding something. This is what he meant: if one uses a vow to press his friend to eat with him, then this is just a vow to create motivation, which is automatically invalid. On a different theme, if one wants his vows for the coming year to be ineffective, he should stand up at the beginning of the year, on Rosh Hashana, and say thus: "All vows (Kol Nidre) that I will vow throughout the year should be void!" Then, when he, later on makes a vow, it is void, provided that he remembers his initial stipulation.
<br />
<br />
But no, just the opposite; if he remembers, why is he making a vow now? – it is to overturn it! Instead, he should NOT remember, and his vow is null and void, according to his "Kol Nidre" declaration.

Although one can annul all his vows for the upcoming year by saying "Kol Nidre," the teacher left it unsaid, and only special people knew through careful reading what he meant. One Sage wanted to publicize the device, but Rava rebuked him: the teacher hid it, and you want to reveal it!?
<br />
<br />
Talmud also wants to know whether other Sages agreed with this teacher (Rabbi Elazar ben Yaakov). After multiple unsuccessful attempts, it finds clear proof that other Sages disagreed. Yet, the law follows Rabbi Elazar ben Yakov, and the annulment of all vows at the beginning of the year is permitted. 
<br />
<br />
We saw that when one presses his friend to accept an invitation and even vows to forbid something should the friend not accept, such a vow is not taken seriously – it is just a matter of speech, designed as motivation to accept.
<br />
<br />
There is another similar category: if one says that he just saw as many people on the road as those that went to Jerusalem, that is, 600,000, and if not, he is taking a vow to forbid himself something, this is just an exaggeration, and the vows does not need annulment by the Sage. A similar vow will be if he says, "I just saw a snake like a beam of a vine press!"

<br />
<br />
For example, one can say, “I swear, and let all the fruit of this world be prohibited to me if I have not seen on the road as many as pilgrims going to Jerusalem!” 
<br />
<br />
But perhaps he saw ants and called them “pilgrims,” and is thus swearing truly!? – No, that cannot be because anyone who takes an oath does so on ordinary people's understanding of words, not on his terms.
<br />
<br />
But if so, why do the standard formulas mention “swear on our understanding, not on yours?” – That is to prevent incidents like the following. One person was going to swear that he returned the money to his fellow, who left it for safekeeping. He put the coins in a walking stick, asked the depositor to hold the stick while he himself was holding the Torah scroll, and swore that he returned the money and that it was in the depositor's hands. At which the depositor became so infuriated that the broke the stick, the money fell out, and it came out that man swore truly. 
<br />
<br />
But did not Moses himself say, “Keep in mind that you swear today to observe the Torah and do this on mine and God's understanding of this?” The Talmud then discusses all possible ways Moses could have put this into the oath to make the contract unbreakable but finds ways to misinterpret them and get out from under the obligation. In the end, the Talmud finds unbreakable verbiage, which is more complex, so it tells that Moses just used the shortest way.

Nedarim 26 – Clear mistakes

One can make an obvious mistake in his vow; if so, the vow does not count, and he does not have to fulfill it. For example, “This food is prohibited to me by a vow if I ate anything today – or if I drank today” – and then he remembers that he did eat or drink.
<br />
<br />
Another example: “Let my wife be prohibited to me by a vow since she stole my wallet – or since she hit my son” – and it turns out that she did not do such a thing.  Yet another example: he sees people eating his dates and vows the dates to be prohibited to them, and then discovers that his father or his brother were with these people  – all such vows are void.
<br />
<br />
In the same way, mistaken oaths are void. For example, Rav Kahana and Rav Asi both took an oath that their teacher said something, and their oaths clearly contradicted. When it was found out that one of them was correct and supported by others, the oath was still not false because, as far as the other one could ascertain, he believed to be telling the truth.

Nedarim 3 – Do not delay
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLROcoeM7fJaNJ53w9ozqxqa17UzUiWETn8KUMt0DQR86F64T80I3r1vhGweSAWCYMy0PmSFicQ73lTzlOWWo-I5XBNdSTbdlitUD4xqUBnyC_Pt5LmZTA5YkchYgJqrhajtqq0UUEvVzN/s1600/A+seated+Peasant+eating+a+Meal+by+German+School.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLROcoeM7fJaNJ53w9ozqxqa17UzUiWETn8KUMt0DQR86F64T80I3r1vhGweSAWCYMy0PmSFicQ73lTzlOWWo-I5XBNdSTbdlitUD4xqUBnyC_Pt5LmZTA5YkchYgJqrhajtqq0UUEvVzN/s320/A+seated+Peasant+eating+a+Meal+by+German+School.jpg" width="237" /></a><a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/nedarim-2-what-is-vow.html">On the previous page</a>, we were left with the question of why the teacher sometimes chooses to explain the concepts out of order, while sometimes he does present them in the order of introduction. The answer is that the teacher loves complicated and non-obvious derivations and prefers to explain them first.
<br />
<br />
Just as one can vow not to eat, drink, or use an object, one can vow to become a Nazir so that he won't drink wine, cut his hair or go to a cemetery. The laws of vows and of Nazir are parallel: one should not violate his vow, nor should he delay it. 
<br />
<br />
However, how can one violate a "do not delay" to become a Nazir? All the time that he is not a Nazir, he is not, and there is no requirement to become one. And once he vows to be a Nazir, he is, and he is not delaying anything.
<br />
<br />
This situation can be found when he says, "I will be a Nazir before I die." Since he does not know when he will die, he should become a Nazir immediately because he might break his vow the next moment. He violates the "do not delay" prohibition when he does not become a Nazir. This is similar to the one who says to his wife, "Here is your divorce (Get) an instant before I die." Suppose, for example, she is married to a Kohen. In that case, she is immediately prohibited from eating Kohen's portion (terumah) since he may die the next moment, and it would come out that she ate terumah illegally. <br />

Nedarim 33 – He paid off your debt? – You don't owe him anything!

How could it be? – By paying off B's debts,  A is simply "chasing a lion away from B's property." That is, he is precluding B's creditors from running after him at some future date, which is not a benefit.
<br />
<br />
But wait, it is a benefit, after all!? – This follows the opinion of Chanan, which we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/ketubot-108-one-who-puts-his-money-on.html">learned earlier</a>: if one goes overseas and leaves his wife without sustenance, and his fellow provides her with money on his own, the husband is not obligated to repay.
<br />
<br />
Are there any other opinions? – Yes, those who disagree with Chanan say it is a benefit. Or, if you want, I can explain that the rule about paying off debts is universally accepted. I can say that loan B does not have any fixed date for payment. Then the creditors will never come to B because the "future date" mentioned above does not exist! So A provided no benefit, and even though he vowed against B, he is still allowed to do this service.
<br />
<br />Another thing that A is allowed to do is pay the half-shekel obligation. Everyone had to pay the half-shekel yearly to provide money for daily sacrifices, but even if he did not pay in the end, he still gets the atonement; thus, paying it for one's fellow is not a benefit.
<br />
<br />
Finally, he is allowed to return the fellow's lost object because he is doing a mitzvah. If in his place, they pay for the trouble of bringing the lost object, he should donate this money to the Temple.

Nedarim 35 – How strong are your vows?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgw8Tix6ZjwEad4ORnvjCvkJyK6XsAn_pppLy36TiGZcMNHZvmfKSYsonrIg8DVf2b8r_xaRikx4-qE88QsS9lHsBxKrvpbiay6tiWNxzNkfFyjx22iXTPIGDMtgRN7lolYOfKuTkZsHrCB/s1600/Studies+of+bread+by+Spanish+School.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="207" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgw8Tix6ZjwEad4ORnvjCvkJyK6XsAn_pppLy36TiGZcMNHZvmfKSYsonrIg8DVf2b8r_xaRikx4-qE88QsS9lHsBxKrvpbiay6tiWNxzNkfFyjx22iXTPIGDMtgRN7lolYOfKuTkZsHrCB/s320/Studies+of+bread+by+Spanish+School.jpg" width="320" /></a>If one declares some object forbidden to himself by a vow, just like a sacrifice, is the prohibition really that strong? For example, if he uses this object after all, does he need to bring an additional sacrifice (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/search/label/Me%27ilah">"Me'ila"</a>), just as he would have for misusing a sacrifice?
<br />
<br />
Perhaps we can prove this is so from the previous ruling. There,&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/06/nedarim-33-he-paid-off-your-debt-you.html">one was allowed to return a lost object even to someone he vowed not to provide any benefit</a>. However, he could not take the reward for this but had to give it to the Temple treasury. Does this not prove the point?  – Actually, this is indeed strong proof. 
<br />
<br />
We find that Rabbi Meir and the Sages argued about this exact point. And since every Sage in the Talmud builds a system of consistent teachings without contradictions, we can rely on them to verify that both points of view are logical and can be valid. 
<br />
<br />
And what did Rabbi Meir and the Sages argue about? – If one prohibits himself from a loaf of bread by a vow and then eats it, he has to bring a Me'ila offering to atone - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that since this loaf is not equally prohibited to all, the concept of Me'ila does not apply. And yet, since the previous rule proves that Rabbi Meir is right, the final law follows him.

Nedarim 36 – Sorry, I cannot teach you Torah

<br />
<br />
Basically, why should Torah be taught for free? Moses said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5016">Look, I taught you the Torah, for free, just as God commanded me</a>," – and you should also teach for free. Then if so, why is teaching Torah considered a benefit, which one should not confer on his fellow if he vowed against him? – We mean teaching the written Torah, and one takes money for teaching the melody, not the words. Alternatively, the art of reading the written Torah is usually taught to small children, and one receives money for being their babysitter rather than a teacher. However, moral lessons are for adults, and one cannot take the reward.
<br />
<br />
The rule says one can teach the fellow's sons and daughters. This rule is the source for the view that Torah should be taught to women as well as men.<br />

Nedarim 37 – Making money on the Torah?

We also noticed that when this teaching is for singing the notes of the Torah, as sung in the synagogue, or simply for watching the kids so that they don't run out during lessons, then getting paid for this is acceptable.
<br />
<br />
But which of these two reasons is the real one? Some say that the singing notes were actually given to Moses together with the rest of the Torah: when Ezra read Torah to the people, he made them "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b08.htm">understand the reading</a>," – which is achieved with proper notes; thus, no money can be earned for teaching that.<br />
<br />
Others argue that "understanding the reading" refers to proper pronunciation since there are places in the Torah where the words should not be read the way they are written. However, the notes were introduced by the Sages of the court of Solomon later, and reward may be taken for teaching them.
<br />
<br />
According to the first point of view, one is not paid for singing but for watching the children. This sounds reasonable; what will the opposing side say? They will answer that boys and girls are equally taught and that little girls cause less trouble and don't run out of the room – so one is not paid for watching them, and we are back to paying for singing.

Rabbi Yose, the son of Rabbi Chanina, said, "The Torah was given only to Moses and his descendants" because it clearly states, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34">Carve for yourself</a>"&nbsp;and "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2521">Write for yourself</a>." However, Moses was friendly and gave it to all of Israel.<br />
<br />
Now, how could it be? Aren't all Israel obligated to fulfill the Torah? Moses himself said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5016">I was commanded by God at this time to teach you the laws and statutes</a>." – Sure, Moses was commanded, he alone, but he chose to teach to all.
<br />
<br />
But what about the song Moses wrote so that "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=31#P5742">it will be for God a testimony</a>?" What testimony is needed if they were not commanded to keep the Torah?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud concedes the point and explains that the Torah was given to all of Israel. However, only Moses and his descendants were initially given the power for logical analysis and deductions. Out of the goodness of his heart, he taught this to all.

Moses said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=16#P4221">If these people die like all men and are visited</a>...” – and from here, we see that usually when people get sick before they die, it is expected that they should be visited. 
<br />
<br />
If one vows against a fellow, he may still visit him if the fellow gets sick, but he should stand and not sit. What are we talking about? If the visitor is prohibited from benefiting the sick one, then the visitor should  be allowed to sit: he is doing a mitzvah. And suppose the visitor is prohibited from receiving benefits from the visitor. In that case, no visits should be allowed since the visitor inevitably derives some benefit by entering the house, which is more protected than being in the street!?<br />
<br />
Really, possessions of the visitor are prohibited to the sick. So the visitor should be able to enter and even sit with the sick person. However, the visitor may sit more than necessary, going beyond the bounds of the mitzvah and providing the sick person with the extra benefit, for which one could even claim a reward. By doing this for free, the visitor would be violating the vow. Therefore, the Sages allowed him to stand – since he would leave on time – but not to sit.

We even found a particular case when it would apply – when one says, "I will be a Nazir before I die."
<br />
<br />
However, is that even true? After all, the laws of Nazir are an unusual innovation not found in other parts of the Torah. What is unusual? – The fact that one can complete his vow of a Nazir by offering only one of the three required sacrifices; is not ideal, but acceptable. You might have thought that just as the laws of a Nazir are more lenient here, so too they are more forgiving in regards to the "Do not delay" requirement. For that, we have to rely on the rule of similarity: vows and Nazir are similar; as such, all laws of vows apply to the Nazir.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, maybe applying the rule of similarity is an overkill? Perhaps a simple rule of "context" would work? "Context" means if we find a law in one case, it applies to all other similar areas. For example, the father can annul a vow of his daughter. Therefore, he should be able to annul other similar vows, such as if she wants to be a Nazir (technically, "Nazirah"). – No, that logic would not work: vows are stricter in that they have no limit, but a usual Nazir is for thirty days. So maybe that's why the father needs the power to annul a vow but not a Nazir vow. Thus, we are back to using the rule of similarity.

Nedarim 40 – Curing the sick

How so? Does it mean that the reward for it is limitless? – Why, all mitzvot are that way! Instead, even a person of great importance should visit people of more diminutive stature. Or it could mean that there is no limit to how many times one may see a sick person, provided that it does not tire the sick one.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva noticed that one of his students did not attend the classes. He visited the student and found him sick and in a dirty, dusty room. Rabbi Akiva cleaned the room and cared for the student – some say that because of this visit, the innkeeper started watching for the student more – and the student recovered. The student told Rabbi Akiva, "Teacher, you brought me back to life!" Rabbi Akiva then taught that one who does not visit the sick is as if he spills blood.<br />
<br />
When Rava would get sick, he first told no one – so that his luck would not turn to the worst through the people wishing him ill. But after three days, he would announce it, saying, "Whoever does not like me will rejoice, and then God will have mercy on me, just as He does for anyone over whom enemies rejoice, and my friends will pray for me."

When the Torah says, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=28#P5653">Because you did not serve God when you had everything and lacked nothing, now you will serve your enemies in hunger and cold and nakedness... without anything</a>,” what does “without anything” mean? What does it add? – Without a wife, he has been without joy, blessing, goodness, Torah, protection, assistance, atonement, peace, and life, and he is considered only half-man.
<br />
<br />
Others say that it means without assistance, others - without understanding. One born with understanding has everything within him, but one born without it should work hard to achieve it. If he mastered it, what does he lack? And if he did not achieve understanding, what has he acquired?
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef got sick and forgot his learning. His student Abaye often reminded him, "This is what you taught us, and you derived it from here."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who compiled and wrote down the Mishnah, initially had thirteen complete versions. He taught seven of these to Rabbi Chiya. Later he got sick and forgot the other six. However, a certain laundryman heard Rabbi Yehudah repeat them out loud, so now he taught them back. Rabbi Yehudah then said, "You made me!" - anyone who teaches a fellow Torah is as if he made him, just like Abraham and Sarah, who "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=12#P304">made souls in Charan</a>."<br />

B can go to a storekeeper whom he frequents and tell him, "A does not have what to eat, and I don't know what to do about it." The storekeeper can take the hint and feed A, and B can then repay him. This is allowed since B never explicitly promised to repay, so the storekeeper acts on his own accord.
<br />
<br />
If they are traveling together on the road and A does not have what to eat, B can give food as a present to other travelers, and they can feed A. If there is no traveler with them, B can put the food on a rock and say, "This food is ownerless, and anyone can take it," and A can then eat it.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose does not allow B to feed A by putting food on a rock because it is evident that he is giving food as a gift. Some say that even passing through other travelers is not permitted by Rabbi Yose.

Nedarim 44 – Because of the cheats

In this way, they would not need to part with about 22% of the crop.
<br />
<br />
To counteract this, the Sages changed the nature of the ownership and decreed that anyone who declares his field ownerless is allowed to change his mind and get it back within the next three days. Now, he still owns the field and has to give tithes. So that people would take this decree seriously, the Sages had to allow one to get the field back even if someone had already taken possession of it. 
<br />
<br />
Why is this mentioned here? Because it seems to answer who is right in the previous question of feeding one who does not have what to eat – there Rabbi Yose <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/07/nedarim-43-vagaries-of-vows.html">did not allow the circumvent a vow by declaring the food ownerless</a>. If at least after three days, one cannot retract, then such declarations are to be taken seriously, and the food in question is really ownerless and not subject to a vow, and the hungry person can eat it – despite what Rabbi Yose said.
<br />
<br />
However, the Talmud finds a way to explain this rule, even according to Rabbi Yose. Thus we do not have a definitive conclusion.

Since the courtyard is not divided, each portion of it is jointly owned by both. Thus, when one treads on the ground, he is partially transgressing the property of his fellow, which is prohibited to him by a vow.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Elazar ben Yakov says that each one enters his own property when he enters the courtyard. When people buy property in common, they divide the ownership of it for use by area and in time. Exactly which portion and at what time belongs to each is determined by the future event of him entering it. So, when he comes into the courtyard, we say that this is precisely what they had agreed to, and now his action clarifies their agreement. This idea of retroactive designation, that is, "I see what happens, and I say that in the past we had actually agreed to exactly this division," is called "breira" or "clarification." 
<br />
<br />
Thus, the argument between the Sages and Rabbi Elazar ben Yakov is whether or not we can apply "clarification" in this case. The Sages do not permit it, but Rabbi Yakov uses it because there is no other choice. Should the courtyard be larger so that they can divide? Even he would not allow them to use it until they split. 
<br />

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/nedarim-4-or-perhaps-do-not-delay-does.html">We learned earlier</a> that one can formulate a simple vow, “I am separated from you,” and the vow will take effect. However, who is forbidden to do what? This is now subject to interpretation. 
<br />
<br />
Shmuel says, “He has to specify what exactly is forbidden.” If he does not, there is no vow at all. This is because Shmuel follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah about a Get: It is not enough to put into the Get “You are hereby permitted to all men.” This may still mean that he divorces her with the verbal statement and treats the Get as a confirmation. Instead, he needs to write, “This will be for you the document of removal, bill of release, and letter of abandonment.” 
<br />
<br />
In other words, it does not help that we understand what the one who makes his vow wants to say. (Technically, his vow is called “partial but sufficient declaration.”) According to Shmuel, this is not enough and must be put into words.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, why do we pay so much attention to legalese in the case of vows? Because vows represent the power of words that existed before the Torah was given.

His daughter Rachel saw Akiva, who was an unlearned shepherd forty years old, and made a deal with him: she would get engaged to him if Akiva promised her to go study Torah. Akiva pledged to, and they got engaged in secret. When Kalva Savua found out, he vowed against her getting any benefit from him and his possessions, and Rachel had to leave the house. They lived in poverty, and Akiva cried, removing a straw from her hair, and promised to give her a gold diadem in the form of Jerusalem if he ever got rich.
<br />
<br />
Once Elijah, the prophet, appeared as a poor man asking for the straw to cover his wife, who had just given birth. This was to console Akiva, who could tell Rachel that they at least had straw.
<br />
<br />
Rachel convinced Akiva to study at an academy, so he left the house and studied for twelve years. As he was coming back, he heard Rachel's neighbor saying to Rachel, "Your husband is not your equal, and moreover, he left you for twelve years – your father did right to disinherit you!" Rachel answered her, "If he listened, I would want him to study another twelve years." On hearing this, now a Rabbi, Akiva went back for another twelve years. He came  back as the leading scholar of the generation.
<br />
<br />
Eventually, Kalba Savua was able to annul his vow because he would never make it had he known that Akiva would become a scholar of such level. Rabbi Akiva became rich from Kalba Savua and because of the other five incidents. Here is the one.
<br />
<br />
A Roman by the name of Tinneius Rufus kept losing arguments with Rabbi Akiva in front of the Roman Emperor. The wife of Tinneus, who was extremely beautiful, suggested this: if the husband gives her permission, she will go and seduce Rabbi Akiva. Since Jewish God hates promiscuity, Rabbi Akiva will lose God's favor, and Tinneus will win over him. She got permission. When Rabbi Akiva saw her, he spat, laughed, and cried. She asked, why? He said he would tell her two reasons, but not the third one. He spat because, beautiful as she was, she came from a putrid drop. He cried because even her exceeding beauty would one day rot in a grave. He did not tell her that he saw that in the future, she would convert and marry him. She then became remorseful and asked him if she could repent her previous misdeeds. He answered, "yes." She converted and eventually married him, bringing him wealth.

But the Sages disagree since they estimate that people mean the complete house, including the attic. However, if he specifically said that he won't enter the attic, all agree that he meant that, and he can still enter the house.
<br />
<br />
If one vowed <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/rules-order-quotes-2.html">not to sleep in a bed</a>, he is still allowed to use a special bed called "dargash," - which is again the opinion of Rabbi Meir. But what is dargash?
<br />
<br />
Ulla said that this was a bed of good fortune. It was customary to designate a bed for a good angel protecting the home to elicit good luck for the house. Since this "dargash" is mentioned in many other rules, the Talmud argues that it could not be the good fortune bed and that dargash means a bed with a leather interior and loops in which the ropes were tied and could be untied. So the bed of good fortune is not disproved, but it must go under a different name.

When he compared his prohibition to sacrifice, he implied the same laws. Just as for a sacrifice – its exchange and its fruit (offspring) are forbidden – so too the fruit he forbade on himself.  
<br />
<br />
However, if he vows against a specific type of fruit, he can exchange it for something else and eat it. This is true for fruit whose seeds decompose in the ground. But those that partially remain, such as onions, are forbidden even as offshoots. 
<br />
<br />
If one is upset with his wife's going to visit her family's home and vows that any benefit from him is forbidden to her in case she does go, we need to look at time limits. If he said that his vow was until Passover, she has to watch not to go before Passover or not to derive any benefit from him. But if he said that the benefit is forbidden until Passover if she goes anytime this year, until Sukkot (which is seven months later), then if she still plans to go, she should be careful not to derive any benefit from him before Passover, because is she finally went, she would violate his vow retroactively.

<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZ4bqMzMZE6cEj6BFd0ythyphenhyphen7B1pnryN0lB83d8A8Q1MlEElbZWpWPIG01kfi_Fm9XuFojMDaNkDAKX4Vnw0-JEwJ33uIos9Srbrxnq-RSKPFebv0objtHY0UoVjVfCtpYm3NiCwNNuAgXh/s1600/Sardines+suspended+from+twine+and+onions+on+a+stone+ledge+by+Giuseppe+Recco.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="235" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZ4bqMzMZE6cEj6BFd0ythyphenhyphen7B1pnryN0lB83d8A8Q1MlEElbZWpWPIG01kfi_Fm9XuFojMDaNkDAKX4Vnw0-JEwJ33uIos9Srbrxnq-RSKPFebv0objtHY0UoVjVfCtpYm3NiCwNNuAgXh/s320/Sardines+suspended+from+twine+and+onions+on+a+stone+ledge+by+Giuseppe+Recco.jpg" width="320" /></a>Rabbi Ishmael from a village by the sea asked a question about an onion, and some say that he brought an actual onion. This onion was picked up in a Shmita year and thus was <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-26-seventh-year-sheviit.html">prohibited from trading</a>&nbsp;to keep after there were no more such onions in the fields, and so on. However, it was replanted in the next year, experienced significant growth, and now the question is: does this new permitted growth nullify the prohibitions of the base onion, or does the new growth itself have the limitations of the Shmita produce.
<br />
<br />Rabbi Ishmael asked about the complete onion and not just the new growth because the answer to this question would automatically give him the answer about the new growth. So he preferred to ask one question that combined the two.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud attempts to find the answer by comparing this to other contemporary or older rulings but finds differences; for example, in our case, the onion does not entirely decompose in the ground, but other rulings may be talking about cases where a seed does decompose.
<br />
<br />
So far, the question is unresolved. The question is unrelated to vows (Nedarim), but it is discussed here because, on the next page, the Talmud will attempt to derive proof from a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/07/nedarim-57-i-am-not-eating-this-fruit.html">law of vows we just learned</a>.

Nedarim 59 – Vows are bad

In this last case, all that grows from that fruit was forbidden, which must prove that new growth does not nullify the old one.
<br />
<br />
However, even this proof does not stand. Vows are different because they are inherently wrong, and no common laws can be derived from them. Why are vows wrong? – Just like Rabbi Nathan said – one who makes a vow is like one who builds a private altar for sacrifices (which is now forbidden, there should be only one Altar in Jerusalem), and one who fulfilled his vow is as if he brought a sacrifice on this altar.
<br />
<br />
To explain, one who builds a private altar probably thinks he does a mitzvah by worshiping in this manner. And one who makes a vow also feels that he did a great thing by creating another prohibition for himself. In truth, the argument should be just the opposite: there are enough prohibitions already, and one should not make more.

Nedarim 6 – Never mind what I said

But this is the same as Rabbi Yehudah and his opponents argued about Get, where <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/nedarim-5-how-to-properly-vow.html">Rabbi Yehudah required a complete formula of "this is for you the document of removal, etc.</a>"<br />
<br />
Why would Rava and Abaye, who lived later, argue about the same question? They could just take sides! Rava would be on the side of Rabbi Yehudah and Abaye – his opponents. No! Abaye will say that even Rabbi Yehudah agrees with him, like so: Rabbi Yehudah required the complete formula only for Get, which should be a complete separation between the husband and wife, but in other cases, he too would say that we understand what is meant, precisely as Abaye!
<br />
<br />
However, later on, we find a refutation for Abaye: in another teaching, even in general, someone required all the details spelled out, and Abaye had to admit it was Rabbi Yehudah. So how could he previously say that everybody agrees with him, and now – that some disagree!? – Abaye changed his mind and admitted that Rabbi Yehudah was always strict and never agreed with Abaye's point that we understand things from the context.
<br />
<br />
Here is an interesting question: can one do a vague Kiddushin? Can he say to one woman, "You are hereby consecrated to me," and to another one - "And you..." Does he mean "And you too," or "You should consider the possibility"? This was left unresolved.

Nedarim 65 – How to cancel (annul) a vow
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigIEzOBOA6AL8p07Zq4Z9xdGP2gNQOf7QI2XTZb1qs4MLFyfNgH-mmX2lYGzRCeLA6FBUSXAdK9r0KcLO5L603S1v7Sq6xasobj3MS8kDUoPWdR4mFaf6DEbg3jHvsjLsFwiBhGNQneyri/s1600/Portrait+Of+The+Artists+Wife+by+Kazimir+Severinovich+Malevich.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigIEzOBOA6AL8p07Zq4Z9xdGP2gNQOf7QI2XTZb1qs4MLFyfNgH-mmX2lYGzRCeLA6FBUSXAdK9r0KcLO5L603S1v7Sq6xasobj3MS8kDUoPWdR4mFaf6DEbg3jHvsjLsFwiBhGNQneyri/s320/Portrait+Of+The+Artists+Wife+by+Kazimir+Severinovich+Malevich.jpg" width="267" /></a>One may want to annul a vow which he took hastily and which causes him inconvenience. Or, one may realize that a vow is not a good thing to do. In either case, he should go to a Sage and petition for his vow to be annulled.
<br />
<br />
The Sage will ask about the circumstances. If it transpires that the man who made the vow did not realize some special circumstance that existed when he made the vow, and had he known about it, he would never have made the vow, the vow is considered a mistake from the beginning, and the Sage annuls it.
<br />
<br />
For example, a man came to Rabbi Akiva and said that he made a vow against his wife, so that she should not be able to benefit from him. Since he is obligated to give her benefits, in order not to transgress now he had to divorce her. Rabbi Akiva told him that: “Divorce and pay the full amount of the Ketubah.” The Ketubah was 4,000 dinars. The man then said, “I inherited 8,000 dinars from my father, and half of it went to my brother. Of the remaining 4,000, couldn't my wife take half and I – also half?” But Rabbi Akiva told him that he would have to pay it all, even if he has to sell his hair. The man then said, “Had I known about this, I would never have vowed!” And this was exactly what is required for his vow to be annulled.<br />

Nedarim 66 – I will not marry this girl!

Initially the rule was that if a part of a vow is annulled, one still has to fulfill the rest of it. Let's say someone vowed against drinking wine, or eating meat. They tell him, did you realize that on Shabbat and Yom Tov one is not supposed to deprive himself? He says, “Had I known that, I would never have vowed” - and he can drink on Shabbat. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Akiva extended this: once is permitted to drink on Shabbat, he is also permitted to drink on other days, the vow is void. How did Rabbi Akiva derive that? – From the phrase, “The full vow that you pronounce you should fulfill.” The other side of this is: once you don't have the “full vow” obligatory on you, you don't even have a part.
<br />
<br />
If one says, “I am not marrying this girl because she is ugly” and she turns out to be beautiful, his vow is annulled, because it was a mistake. We assume that he just did not see her beauty at first. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ishmael takes this further: even if she was ugly and was made beautiful - so that this is something unforeseen, not something that he did not realized - his vow can still  be annulled. Once a man vowed that he will not marry his niece because she was ugly (she had a bad-looking false tooth). Rabbi Ishmael paid the dentist to fix it, provided beautiful clothes to her, and then asked the man, “Is it this one that you vowed against?” The man said, “Had I known that she will be so beautiful, I would never have taken the vow!” Rabbi Ishmael cried and said, “All daughters of Israel are beautiful, it is only poverty that makes them sometimes  homely.”

Nedarim 7 – I am excommunicated from you!

<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva struggled with this case, and even though he might rule stringently and maintain that this creates a vow, he still remained in doubt. This meant that there would be no punishment for violating such vow. Most of the time, when people use the word “excommunicate,” they mean a religious disciplinary measure, not a vow to abstain from dealing with one's fellow.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, a Sage who hears bad words from his fellow should excommunicate him. But it is not appropriate for a Sage to excommunicate anybody, so what is he to do? – He should then annul his excommunication. Or, he can be like Mar Zutra, who would first excommunicate himself and then the student when he needed to excommunicate one of his students. On coming home, he would annul excommunication for himself and then for the student.

However, this veto power only lasts for one day, after which the  vow becomes valid like any other vow. Similarly, if a married woman makes a vow, her husband has veto power for one day.
<br />
<br />
If a young girl is engaged (this is a complete engagement, requiring a proper divorce Get) for dissolution) but not living with her husband yet, then both the husband and the father have the veto power, which they would exercise jointly. 
<br />
<br />
What happens if a girl in this situation took a vow, then divorced, or her husband died, and then she got engaged again on the same day? The answer does not change even if she divorced and got engaged a hundred times on this day – her father and her last-in-row husband can jointly cancel her vow during this day.
<br />
<br />
We see thus that the veto power does not go over to the father on the death of the husband, but rather the father and the last-in-row husband can jointly cancel the vow; as long as the girl was not fully married, she remains in part under the jurisdiction of her father.

Since he knows that he cannot revoke the vow any longer after divorce, is he affirming it by his action? Or he does not care and offers no comment.
<br />
<br />
What is the difference? If she made a vow and a day passed, her vow is now binding anyway!? – The difference is in the case where he remarried her on that same day. Since the day has not passed, then if we say that he offered no comment, he can still annul the vow. But if his divorce was a confirmation, he could no longer change his mind.
<br />
<br />
Can we resolve our question from our <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/08/nedarim-71-father-and-his-son-in-law.html">previous ruling</a>? There the husband could still revoke the vow, so it must be that divorce is tantamount to silence and expresses no opinion! – No, perhaps our ruling only discusses the case where the husband did not hear her vow. The ruling just gives us the fundamental law that if the father heard about the vow and the groom did not, they only have one day to veto it. About our question, the ruling may be offering no opinion whatsoever. 
<br />
<br />
A custom of the learned people: before the wedding, the groom would annul all his bride's vows while being betrothed to him. Could he annul even those that he had never heard about? – This will be researched on the next page.

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/08/nedarim-72-why-did-he-divorce-her.html">Earlier, we learned</a> that knowledgeable people annulled their brides' vows, whatever they were. This indicates that a vow can be annulled even without hearing what it is. However, this is not really so. The rule may be that the husband inquires about every vow and then annuls it.
<br />
<br />
Let us try to approach this question from another side. A deaf husband cannot annul his wife's vows, because "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=30#P4653">and the husband hears</a>..." cannot be fulfilled. Does it mean that a regular husband also needs to hear the vow? – Perhaps not: a deaf husband cannot hear at all, that is why "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=30#P4653">and the husband hears</a>..." is impossible, so he cannot annul. However, if he can hear, then maybe actual hearing is not required. 
<br />
<br />
Once the groom marries his wife under the huppah, he alone, not her father, has veto power for her vows. What if he is supposed to make a wedding feast but delays it. He is already obligated in her support, so maybe he can annul the vows – or perhaps since he is not fully married, he cannot? – This question is also not resolved because related rules can be interpreted as supporting or disproving this fact.

Nedarim 8 – Good advice from Rav Gidel

Let us see some more of Rav Gidel's advice.
<br />
<br />
It is commendable to take an oath to do a mitzvah. Even though one is already under oath to do mitzvot, since the Jewish people have accepted this oath as a whole, it is still OK to do more. We learn it from King David, who said, “I swore, and I will perform Your righteous mitzvot.”
<br />
<br />
He also said that one who saw in a dream himself being excommunicated should find ten scholars to lift the ban from him. These should be people able to reason, not just retell the laws. But if one can't find such scholars, those who know the law will also do. And if one cannot find even these, he should sit on the crossroad and greet every person with “Peace be unto you.” After ten passersby return his greeting with “Peace unto you,” his ban is lifted.<br />

Nedarim 84 – What's allowed when everything is forbidden
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPm0stk4Y31Ibw_fjD8oPvA8mB11qKkk-7XFLLFXBo3ujCaoaZhHLEGGX2NFlwcX8j8mgC_VXMyfbZljOekqigap1DPERIEhxIazThDSnTfP5blGUwj6EVffpUizk146M5ZZD_MS6hm4_W/s1600/Harvesting+the+Sheaves+by+Sandor+Nagy.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPm0stk4Y31Ibw_fjD8oPvA8mB11qKkk-7XFLLFXBo3ujCaoaZhHLEGGX2NFlwcX8j8mgC_VXMyfbZljOekqigap1DPERIEhxIazThDSnTfP5blGUwj6EVffpUizk146M5ZZD_MS6hm4_W/s320/Harvesting+the+Sheaves+by+Sandor+Nagy.jpg" width="282" /></a>As we have seen, a husband has veto power over his wife's vows – but this is only if it concerns him in some way. For example, if she vows not to benefit from any human – he cannot annul that because she can still avail herself of "owner-less" produce, which includes fallen grapes, forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the fields. All these are left by the field owner for the poor in the "owner-less" state.
<br />
<br />
Why did this ruling leave out the tithe left for the poor? Do people leave over this 10% tithe at all? They do – because anyway, they have an easy loophole to keep it: just declare all your possessions owner-less, then you are considered poor and can appropriate the poor men's tithe, and then reclaim your possessions. Thus those who want to be good and leave the tithe can be relied upon. Another view is that they can't avoid the tithe easily since they are afraid that someone will claim their owner-less possessions. Regardless, there is a group of people who do leave the poor man's tithe.
<br />
<br />
The question then is back, why not the tithe? – That is because he distributes it in his gates to whomever he wants. Thus&nbsp;she is benefiting from his goodwill, which she forbade herself. She could take even that if he distributes it in his granary by leaving it over for all.

Nedarim 85 – I am not giving anything to Kohanim and Levites!

After he separates from his crop those tithes that are due to them – he does not own them any longer. Therefore, they can take tithes against his will. Even though he usually can choose which Kohen or Levy to give it to and even accept a small tip for it, now that he forbade this produce to them anyway, he has no right to it either. Thus, he is not providing them with any benefit whatsoever.
<br />
<br />
However, if he specified which Kohanim or Levites he is vowing against, they indeed cannot take his tithes. Others should come and take that. 
<br />
<br />
If a woman is upset with her husband and makes a vow that the product of her work will be forbidden to him, the vow does not take effect – because he is entitled to this product. However, Rabbi Akiva says that he better revoke it anyway: she might make more than required, and that would actually be forbidden to him. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri gives another reason for annulling such a vow: what if he divorces her? – Not being able to revoke the vow now, he would be unable to re-marry her.

Nedarim 86 – Who made the vow?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhG8ZPQzOJrPsP1cFkGJGTjosbtbDQziymV04ad5pXA9tS-JW6gyc3oNpYFpYq0C-ELOHgnDdZ7tEc1T9UkYbxkmn8HMYpoFQv2K3xbWtjxbCB3IwugQTBCpBZWXJH1qNc_RDp9Slpnqigt/s1600/Mourning+And+Melancholia+by+Charles+Zacharie+Landelle.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhG8ZPQzOJrPsP1cFkGJGTjosbtbDQziymV04ad5pXA9tS-JW6gyc3oNpYFpYq0C-ELOHgnDdZ7tEc1T9UkYbxkmn8HMYpoFQv2K3xbWtjxbCB3IwugQTBCpBZWXJH1qNc_RDp9Slpnqigt/s320/Mourning+And+Melancholia+by+Charles+Zacharie+Landelle.jpg" width="320" /></a>If one thought that his wife made a vow, and he revoked it, and then it turned out that it was his daughter who made this vow – he must now revoke it for his daughter. His original revocation for this wife does not count. Similarly, if he thought that his wife vowed to abstain from grapes, and it turns out that she wanted to abstain from figs, he needs to do the revocation once more. 
<br />
<br />
That is strange because you can compare this case to one where he heard that his father died – and he tore his clothing, as required – and then they told him that it was his son who died – he does not have to tear his clothing again. Thus we see that he is not required to know the precise identity!<br />
<br />
What is the difference? – in the case of tearing, they actually did not tell him who it was, and he tore without specifying the relative. This is why it worked for another relative. But usually, one has to be aware of the identity. 
<br />
<br />
Another possible explanation is this: they did tell him who died; he tore the clothing, but then they informed him about a different identity – within a few seconds of the first statement. Thus, their correction is a continuation of the statement, and his tearing applies to a new relative. And how many seconds is required? – Enough to say “Peace to you, my teacher.”

Nedarim 87 – The husband against grapes but not against figs
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdjV5wSeA26VMjSCkoVjpumiwgTa6bYHujWw4n07MZdaEzrxXiZMR_Hnzel61lyPYkqHHTsrd4_0AkhEpLuhJpCs8zFtcqToBS-CedC1nprEwKt4qE7XE-QNwjN8UurjGlvQ1tpaX07JvE/s1600/A+Still+Life+Of+Grapes+In+A+Basket+by+Frans+Snyders.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="254" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdjV5wSeA26VMjSCkoVjpumiwgTa6bYHujWw4n07MZdaEzrxXiZMR_Hnzel61lyPYkqHHTsrd4_0AkhEpLuhJpCs8zFtcqToBS-CedC1nprEwKt4qE7XE-QNwjN8UurjGlvQ1tpaX07JvE/s320/A+Still+Life+Of+Grapes+In+A+Basket+by+Frans+Snyders.jpg" width="320" /></a>If the wife makes a vow to not eat grapes and figs, and the husband confirms only the grape prohibition, then the figs prohibition is also established. This is because the Torah said, “The husband hears (and confirms) about it,” which can be translated as “even a part of it.” However, if he annuls only the figs part, he still needs to revoke the grapes. Some say that he needs to rescind the complete vow  – because the Torah said, “Revokes it,” meaning the whole vow needs to be revoked. 
<br />
<br />
We thus see that confirming the vow and annulling it are different. There is another way to look at it. Since the Torah said that “The husband will confirm and the husband will annul,” we compare the two: just as in confirming it, once he confirms part, the whole is confirmed, and so is annulment: once he annuls part, the total is annulled. This is indeed the view of Rabbi Akiva. 
<br />
<br />
Moreover, if she says, “I am not eating grapes, and I am not eating figs,” – these are two separate vows that need to be annulled separately. This is the view of Rabbi Shimon, who requires separate legal statements about everything. That is why our rule above forbidding grapes and figs is considered a single vow. Those who disagree will consider the initial statement as two separate vows, and the above discussion about separate annulment would not even apply.

Nedarim 88 – The husband did not know

Therefore, once he finds out that he has this capability, he has a day to revoke the vow or confirm it.
<br />
<br />
However, if he knew about revocation, just did not know that a specific vow could be revoked by him – then it's his problem. Even if he revokes this vow, just to be on the safe side, this revocation does not work because he lacks complete knowledge. And later, it would be too late because the first day had passed. Why is this case different? – He should have gone to a Sage to clarify on that very day. This is the view of Rabbi Meir.
<br />
<br />
The Sages, however, disagree: since he knew about vow revocation but just did not know that this particular vow could be revoked by him – and he revoked it just in case – it works. The Sages consider partial knowledge the same as complete knowledge. Afterward, he cannot revoke it any longer since the first day of the hearing has passed.

So why are these words necessary? – This teaches the following case: if she took a vow while being a widow – for example, if she said that she would have something prohibited to her after thirty days – and then she got married. Such a vow the new husband will not be able to annul.
<br />
<br />
Conversely, if she vowed while being married, and her vow was to take effect after thirty days, and the husband annulled it but later divorced her. Even though by the time thirty days pass, she is no longer married, his annulment is valid, and her vow is ineffective. 
<br />
<br />
If she vowed, then divorced, and then her husband re-married her, he can no longer annul her vows. Therefore, this is the general rule: if she has been on her own even for one minute, the husband can no longer annul her vows.

Careless people were swift to make vows or swear, in anger or just to convince, and this man, disapproving of them, still followed their example. This is an incomplete vow, which nevertheless takes effect.
<br />
<br />
But this vow is too incomplete, he in fact said nothing binding! – Really, he then added, “on me.” But what precisely is his vow? What limitation did he put upon himself! – A Nazir was passing in front of him, or he added, “Of this, I will not eat.”
<br />
<br />
If he has specified so much, what new information has the teacher told us? Of course, the vow should work! – Well, although he did not enunciate, “I hereby take a vow,” his declaration of “Like the vows of the careless” still took effect. 
<br />
<br />
If he said, “Like the vows of the righteous,” it is as if he has not said anything because the righteous don't make vows. However, if he said, “Like their free-will offerings,” he should follow a good example of the righteous and do what he promised. 
<br />
<br />
King Solomon said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3105.htm">Better not vow at all than vow and not pay</a>.” What about one who vows and does pay? Some say that it is still better not to vow at all, but some – say that vowing and fulfilling the vow is better than anything.

Suppose, however, she makes the following vow: she will be prohibited to derive any benefit from her husband if she ever does any service to his father. This vow does not yet exist. Nevertheless, it can be annulled for the following reasons: it involves self-affliction and is bound to happen.
<br />
<br />A man prohibited himself from any benefit from the world if he married without first learning the laws of proper behavior. Ultimately, he could not learn, and due to his vow, he could not get married. Rav Acha tricked him into marrying by telling him the vow was invalid. Then, after the vow became valid, he pushed him into the dirt – so he needed a cleaning service, which his vow prohibited. 
<br />
<br />
In this state, Rav Acha brought the man to Rav Chisda, a Sage empowered to annul vows. Who can be as wise as Rav Acha to act like this? Why did Rav Acha have to do this? – Because he disagreed with the ruling above that an inevitable vow can be annulled before it happens. Instead, according to him, the vow had to exist before anything could be done about it.

We are talking about the situation where a wife of a Kohen was violated. Unlike a regular Jew, the Kohen cannot remain married to her.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, if she says, "Heaven between us," – this is a euphemism to say that he is impotent – she is likewise believed and gets a divorce and Ketubah. And a similar law applies if she says, "I am removed from all Jews." This is because she finds cohabitation painful. He cannot annul such a vow but instead has to divorce her and pay a Ketubah.
<br />
<br />
All these rulings were changed when the Sages saw that people were applying them to cheat others. Therefore, for all such claims, the wife is not believed. For impotence, they make a "polite request." However, there are many ways to understand this: a husband makes a banquet for his wife to convince her to be silent about this, or the court makes such a request, etc.
<br />
<br />
One time a husband entered a house where a man, known for his adventures with women, was hiding. The husband wanted to eat some cress, but the hiding man saw that a snake had tasted it, so he warned the husband. The question arose: Was the man's wife now prohibited to him because of possible adultery? Rava said that she was permitted, for had infidelity really happened, the man would instead prefer to see the husband dead. Rava supported his view with the quote, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1223.htm">They committed adultery, and the blood is on their hands</a>." 
<br />
<br />
Why did Rava need a quote? His logic seems right!? – There is an opposing idea, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2809.htm">Stolen waters are sweet, and the bread of secrecy is pleasant</a>." So perhaps the lovers would prefer occasional meetings in secret to full availability. – This is why Rava needed his proof.

If a young girl whose time to discharge blood has not yet arrived – that is, she has not reached the age – discharged blood, then the first time she has the presumption of ritual purity, and all foods that she handled prior remain pure. After the second time she is still not given retroactive impurity, and only after the third time she has the law of all other women, and the foods that she handled become retroactively impure, back to the time of a previous check, but no more than twenty-four hours back. If she then misses three periods, she has the presumption of purity again. This, however, is only the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who states that three missed periods remove her from retroactive impurity.
<br />
<br />
It once happened that such a case came to the court of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, and he ruled the foods pure, which agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. Afterwards, Rabbi Yehudah recalled that the Sages disagreed with Rabbi Eliezer, and it bothered him. However, he then confirmed his ruling, saying that Rabbi Eliezer is great enough to rely on his opinion at the time of pressing need. What was the pressing need? Some say that it was the time of a famine, and the foods that she handled were such that they could not be eaten should they become impure. Others say that she has handled massive amounts of food, and making them impure would result in a large loss.

And yet, even such woman, if she handles ritually pure foods, has to examine herself at regularly scheduled times, morning and evening. The exceptions to this rule are a woman who had a discharge (niddah) and is waiting to become pure by going to a mikvah, and the one who is, on the contrary, pure after having given birth.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, a woman with a fixed period, if she handles ritual foods, needs to examine herself before and after having relations with her husband. An exception to this rule is a virgin who just married and whose blood is considered pure.
<br />
<br />
A daughter or a wife of a Kohen has an additional stringency, since she eats the priestly portion (terumah), which requires an additional level of purity. Because of this, she needs an examination at the time they wish to eat terumah. Rabbi Yehudah said, “And also after eating it,” to remove the doubt from what is left.

Rabbi Zeira inquired, “Can she be more stringent and examine herself anyway?” Ravi Yehudah answered, “No.” Rabbi Zeira asked, “But what would be wrong if she does, out of piety?” Rav Yehudah answered, “No, she should not, because it may put a strain on the relationship.”
<br />
<br />
Donkey drivers and itinerant workers, as well as those who return from the house of mourning or the house of feasting (a wedding), when they come back after a period of absence, can be with their wives without asking them about their purity status – provided that they left them in the state of purity. Why is that? Couldn't it be otherwise? – Since the husband comes after a period of absence, he will make prolonged overtures to his wive, and this will lead the wife to recall if she is forbidden to have relations with him.<br />
<br />
Rav Kahana wanted to know if that was indeed the law. He asked the wives of two Sages, Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, “Do your husbands require you to make an examination, after they come home on Fridays after a week of teaching in the study hall?” and they answered, “No.” Why didn't he ask the husbands themselves? – Because they would tell him the actual law, but not the personal stringency, if they had one, while the wives would not be so careful about keeping the private stringency secret.”

What is the difference between a woman and a man? A woman does not experience a titillating sensation when she examines herself, but  a man does. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer said, "Whoever grasps his organ when he urinates is as if he brings a flood upon the world," - since the generation of the Flood wasted their seed. The Sages said to Rabbi Eliezer, "If he does not hold his organ, droplets may fall on his feet, and he will appear as one who has a cut organ – who is incapable of having children – and thus people may suspect that his children are not his own." Rabbi Eliezer answered them, "Let him stand on a high place and urinate, but if this is not possible, better cast aspersions on his children than be bad in front of God for even a moment."<br />
<br />
One who wastes semen is compared to a murderer and to one who worships idols. But where is this prohibition in the Torah? Some say it is implied in "do not commit adultery," and some - in "be fruitful in multiply."<br />
<br />
Does the "hand to be cut off" mean the literal law, or just a curse? The Talmud tries to find proof from many laws and stories but then leaves the matter unresolved.

The pious ones had a new cloth for every cohabitation, if there were multiple cohabitations. 
<br />
<br />
If blood was found on his cloth, then she indisputably had blood during cohabitation, and each one is now obligated in a sin-offering.  Regarding her cloth, there are three time periods. If blood was found on her cloth immediately after cohabitation, both need a sacrifice. If it was found after a time (enough to reach under a pillow and pull out  a cloth), both bring an offering of uncertainty. If it was found after that, there is not more consequence than making the foods that she touched ritually impure retroactively.
<br />
<br />
But why is the above true? Maybe it was the blood of a louse on the cloth? Rabbi Zeira said, “That place is considered inspected with regard to a louse” – meaning, lice never visit the genital area. Others say, “It is too crowded for a louse,” - meaning, lice are usually not found in the genital area, because it is too constricted for them to enter. What is the practical difference between the two explanations? – Where  a crushed louse was found on a cloth. According to the first explanation, it must have come from elsewhere, and the blood came from the woman. But according to the second, perhaps the louse was in the genital area, and then the organ crushed it, so the man and the woman are in doubt about their transgression.

Niddah 15 – The Wife is Always Pure

The checks that were learned about before were only instituted for women involved in preparation of ritually pure foods, in the time of the Temple and for some time afterward. Furthermore, the husband does not have to ask his wife if she is a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/definition-of-term-niddah.html">niddah</a>. Those man who come home from a journey can also presume that their wives are pure.
<br />
<br />
What was the need to teach the second part of the ruling, for men who come from a journey? You might have thought that the above ruling only applies when the husband is in town and can return home any time, and that's why we assume that the wife already performed any examination she might need to do, but, however, when he is out of town, she may not be so careful – the teacher had to tell us that the rule applies in both situations.
<br />
<br />
In explaining this rule, Rav Huna said that it only applies if the time for her fixed period has not arrived – because Rav Huna consider the needs to be more careful on this day as a Torah requriement given at Sinai. However, Rabbah bar bar Chanah said that when the time for her fixed period arrived, she is still permitted to her husband, because he considers this need as only instituted by the Sages, and here it is unknown if the examination was already performed.

<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai say that she must use two clean examination clothes for each and every act of cohabitation, or she must cohabit by the light of a lamp. That means, she must wipe herself before and after the act, and set the cloth aside for later examination. If she only has one cloth, she must inspect it by lamplight each time. Actually, one should not cohabit by lamplight, but only use it for the inspection. Beit Hillel, on the other hand, say that two examination clothes suffice her through the entire night.
<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: “According to your view, it is possible that the blood is covered by later wiping.” Beit Hillel answered, “Even according to you, it might still be diluted with semen and dissipate!” Beit Shammai replied, “One-time dilution is not comparable to two-times dilution.”

Engaging in marital relations while it is light is considered vulgar. There are exceptions to this rule, such when one has no other time or is too tired at night. A scholar may cover his bed with a cloak.
<br />
<br />
What is the source for general rule? Rabbi Yochanan said, from the book of Job, “Likewise the night that declared: A man has been conceived” – night is given for conception, but not day. But Resh Lakish derives it from Proverbs, “One who degrades his way...” and “way” is an euphemism for marital relations. According to Resh Lakish, “night that declared” means something different: there is an angel called “Night,” or “Laila.” That angel takes the drop from which the child will be conceived, places it before the Holy One Blessed is He, and asks, “Master of the Universe! This drop, what is its destiny? Mighty or weak; intelligent or foolish; wealthy or poor?” However, he does not ask, “Wicked or righteous?” This agrees with the lesson that Rav Chanina derived from the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=10#P5193">And now, Israel, what does God want of you? Only that you remain in awe of God your Lord, so that you will follow all His paths</a>...”<br />
<br />
One should not cohabit in the presence of other living beings. Rabbi Yehudah asked, “Even mice?” Shmuel answered him, “Smart one! I only meant a certain family who engage in relations in the presence of their slaves and slave-women.” And what was the family's justification? – Since the Torah said, “Stay here by yourself with the donkey,” some people are likened to &nbsp;a donkey. Nevertheless, Abaye would chase away the flies, and Rava – the gnats.

Niddah 18 – A Metaphor
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgadbx0OBRQOvb8WmN7ZFU_Wvfg9Tlb23dFQcMLX8E1XvYcwe2UpTQ9rJto39263L8aJM0VeWgI-gnuhpnNdNQCd2EMQXUGZj04MBHt47S9Rzb_4cFZnYZo_jqbSj2luPBpdvAm2CsPBkiu/s1600/Peter+Vilhelm+Ilsted+-+Woman+reading.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgadbx0OBRQOvb8WmN7ZFU_Wvfg9Tlb23dFQcMLX8E1XvYcwe2UpTQ9rJto39263L8aJM0VeWgI-gnuhpnNdNQCd2EMQXUGZj04MBHt47S9Rzb_4cFZnYZo_jqbSj2luPBpdvAm2CsPBkiu/s320/Peter+Vilhelm+Ilsted+-+Woman+reading.jpg" width="276" /></a>The Sages composed a metaphor to describe the reproductive organs in the body of a woman. They spoke of the room (the womb), the corridor (the vaginal canal), and the attic (the upper cavity). There are two ways to explain “the upper cavity.” Some say that in ancient times, when there were no drugs or antibiotics, there could often be a “passageway” between the vaginal canal and such body parts as urethra. Others simply take “the upper cavity” to indicate any uncommon source of blood, such as a wound.
<br />
<br />
Blood that originates in the “room” is ritually impure, and blood that originates in the “attic” is pure. If blood was found in the “corridor,” it could have come either from the room or from the attic. However, since the room discharges blood frequently, and the attic only infrequently, the blood in the corridor is presumed to have come from the room, and is declared as definitely impure.
<br />
<br />
The practical consequence of this rule is that if the woman touched ritually pure foods, such as the Kohen's portion, or “terumah,” the food is declared definitely impure, and is burned because of that. Should it be only a doubt, the food would not be burned, but would not be eaten either, but the rule resolves this uncertainty.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan said that there are three places in this Tractate where the rule of majority was used to resolve uncertainty, and ours is one of them. The Talmud then investigates what the other ones are, and why yet additional ones were not included.

<br />
<br />
What is red? – Similar to the blood of a wound. What is black? – Similar to black pigment used in creating ink. In truth, black is presumed to have been red initially, and then change colors, so it is not a new color. If we didn't say this, we would five colors, and not four. A “corner of a crocus” means the most brilliant, or the brightest, part of the crocus. “Earth waters” are obtained by taking earth from the valley of Beit Kerem, and floating water upon it. By diluted wine the rule means two times water and one part wine, as was the custom in the early times, when the wine produced was extremely strong.
<br />
<br />
How do we know that not every color of blood is ritually impure? Because in describing how a rebellious Sage disagrees with the Sanhedrin, the Torah uses the words, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=17#P5367">If there be hidden from you a matter of judgment, between blood and blood</a>.” They must have been arguing about the colors of blood from the womb.
<br />

How do we know to include exactly four shades of red? Because the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=20#P3334">her bloods</a>” and then again “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=12#P3049">her bloods</a>,” the first plural counting as two and the second also as two, to the total of four.

Niddah 2 - Presumption of Ritual Purity

That is true even if the blood has not yet descended through the vaginal canal to the outside of her body. In other words, if a woman performs an internal examination by wrapping a cloth around her finger and by carefully wiping it against the sides of the vaginal canal and finds blood on the fabric - she may have been impure for some time before that.
<br />
<br />
Shammai says that, nevertheless, only those foods that she touches from now on become impure. That is because there is a rule of preserving the status quo: the woman was pure before, so we can assume that she only becomes impure from the moment when she actually sees the blood. Hillel, however, says that we go all the way to the previous examination, even days back, and declare all foods that she touched potentially impure – since the blood may have appeared right after her last examination. Hillel agrees to the status quo principle, but in this case, there is something that weakens the presumption - she sees actual blood.
<br />
<br />
The Sages take an intermediate position: the food she touches is declared impure retroactively – either to the last examination or twenty-four hours back, whichever is shorter. The Sages agree in principle with Hillel, but they say that the blood cannot remain in the vaginal canal for longer than twenty-four hours.

Rav Yehudah explained, “Like the blood of a slaughtered ox.” Ami the Beautiful said, “Like a wound of a little finger that was cut, then healed, and then cut again, and not the little finger of any person, but only a man who has not wed a wife, until the age of twenty.” Rav Nachman said, “Like the blood of bloodletting.”
<br />
<br />
Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi all went for bloodletting. When they extracted the first tube of blood of Ameimar, he said, “That blood color is just like in the rule (above) about a woman.” On the second tube he mentioned, “The color has changed.” Rav Ashi after this remarked, “I, who cannot tell the difference between the two shades, should never rule on it, even for such an important matter as to permit a woman to her husband.”
<br />
<br />
Ifra Hurmiz, the mother of the Persian king Shapur, observed the laws of niddah. She once sent her blood to Rava, who said, “It is the blood of desire, and it is not like other bloods, but it is pure.” (Some say, it is impure, and Rava was demonstrating his deep knowledge.) She said to her son, “Look how wise Jews are!” He said, “Maybe he just stumbled upon the answer.” She then sent Rava sixty types of blood, and he identified them all, except for the last one, the blood of a louse. He had help from Above though, since together with his answers he sent her a fancy comb used to kill lice. She exclaimed, “Jews, you dwell in the chambers of the heart!”

Niddah 21 – Miscarriage

However, after this begins her period of purity, and even if she sees blood, this blood is pure. This period lasts for thirty-three days for a male child, and sixty-six for a female. This purity is only in regards to her relations with her husband; in order to go to the Temple, she needs to wait out the complete time above, and then bring a childbirth offering.
<br />
<br />
If she miscarries a formless mass, it is not considered birth at all. Consequently, she is only impure if together with the mass she expelled some blood; otherwise she is pure. Rabbi Yehudah declares her impure even in that case.
<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? Actually, they argue in a narrow case. If the expelled mass was one of the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-19-four-colors.html">four colors discussed previously</a>, all agree that she is impure. They only argue about the case where she misplaced the mass before it could be examined. Rabbi Yehudah says that since statistically the miscarriage has one of these colors in the majority of cases, we have to assume that hers was the same way. However, the Sages disagree about this statistics and say that it is not a proven fact.

Therefore she is definitely not impure with the impurity of childbirth. However, these items may be coagulated menstrual blood, and then she would be impure with the regular impurity of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/definition-of-term-niddah.html">niddah</a>.<br />
<br />
In that case, she should test them by placing them in water and soaking them there. If they dissolve, this is menstrual blood, and she is impure, but if not, she is pure. In the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-21-miscarriage.html">previous case of a formless mass</a>, the teacher did not prescribe this test, because he is of the opinion that menstrual blood does not coagulate into a large mass, but only into a small object the size of midge or hair.

If she aborts something resembling domesticated animal, wild animal, or fowl, then Rabbi Meir says that she observes the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-21-miscarriage.html">waiting periods as if she gave birth to a human</a>, but the Sages say that only a human-like form considered birth for the purposes of ritual purity.
<br />
<br />
We can understand the Sages, but how does Rabbi Meir arrive at his point of view, and why does he not include the likeness of a fish? Some say, this is because the term “created” was used in conjunction with human and with animals. But “created” is also used in “And God created large sea creatures!?” – This is a difficulty that the Talmud explains by analyzing the use of the extra word, “created” in different context. Other say, this is because animal eyes resemble those of humans.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yirmiyah asked Rabbi Zeira, “According to Rabbi Meir, who considers the shape of an animal like a human in some way, what if this animal is a female, and its father accepted a marriage proposal money from a man for it – can that man marry her sister?” 
<br />
<br />
Rav Adda bar Ahava asked Abaye, “What if – the other way around – an animal gives birth to someone resembling human, would Rabbi Meir say it is a human?” What difference does it make? – In the case where the mother animal was slaughtered before giving birth, would her ritual slaughter allow to eat this creature, like it does for normal animals?

There is, however, a point of view that an animal that is terefah actually can survive. According to this view, the child is viable, and the mother has the impurity of childbirth.
<br />
<br />
The sons of Rabbi Chiya went to inspect their fields. When they came back, their father asked them if they were presented with any questions. They said, “They asked us about a child with unformed face, and we ruled this a viable child and assigned to his mother birth-impurity.” Rabbi Chiya said, “Go back and retract your ruling. You thought to rule stringently, just in case, but you cannot do this here, because this stringency leads to a leniency in the end, when she is given a long period of purity following childbirth.”
<br />
<br />
If a woman aborts a child having the semblance of Lilith, the mother of demons, who have a human face and possess wings, then the mother has the impurity of childbirth, because it is a human child, only it has wings.

There is no need to suspect that perhaps there was a more fully developed child, but it got disintegrated. However, if the limbs of the baby began to be developed – but the gender cannot as yet be determined –  she must observe the overlapping periods of childbirth impurity, then childbirth purity with the stringency of both a female and a male child.
<br />
<br />
Abaye said rhetorically, “How much wine does the mother have to drink for the child to dissolve?” He meant that it is impossible, and there was no child. Abba Shaul said, “I was a gravedigger, and I saw that bones of those who drink very strong wine get burned, bones of those to who drink overdiluted wine are dry, and bones of those who drink proper wine are well lubricated.”
<br />
<br />
He continued with a fantastic story. “I was a gravedigger and once ran after a deer, and entered into a thighbone of a corpse. I pursued the deer for about ten miles, and I never reached the deer nor the end of the thighbone. I retraced my steps, and was later told that this was the thigh bone of <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=3#P4984">Og, the King of Bashan, the last of the race of giants who lived in the Land of Israel in early Biblical times</a>.” Talmud concludes that one should not think that Abba Shaul was a midget, for he was the tallest man of his generation. The Talmud then continues to recount previous generations who were even taller. There is allegorical meaning in all these stories.

That is, if a woman expelled an afterbirth without a sign of a fetus, we must assume that there was a fetus but it died and disintegrated after it emerged, transmitting ritual impurity of a corpse to everything in the house. Rabbi Shimon says, “The child disintegrated before it emerged from the mother. A dead fetus does not contaminate while it is inside the mother, and by the time the afterbirth appeared, the fetus was no more, so everything in the house is pure.”
<br />
<br />
To be considered afterbirth, it must have the size of no less than a hand-breadth. Incidentally, there are five laws where the measurement is a hand-breadth, and afterbirth is first. Also there is the shofar, which must be no less than a hand-breadth to be visible; a lulav – a palm branch taken on Sukkot, which must extend at least a hand-breadth over the other species; the walls of a sukkah, since we learned that a sukkah needs at least two full walls, and a third one no less than a hand-breadth; and a hyssop, used to purify a spiritual leper or the ritual impurity of a corpse.

After Rav's death, his student Rav Yehudah and his other students went to study with Shmuel, and were telling him the statements of Rav. Rav Yehudah said, “For the first three days after the birth of a child, the emergence of an afterbirth is attributed to that child that was born. There is no concern for another child that might have dissolved, and no ritual impurity associated with it – nor any special laws for the woman. After three days, we must be concerned with the possibility that there was another child.
<br />
<br />
However, as the other students of Rav added, that's only if she first had a miscarriage, and then the afterbirth, and not the other way around. This is also only true when the first child was sufficiently developed that had it been a full-term baby, it could have survived. Since Rav Yehudah did not relate these details accurately, Shmuel looked at him with displeasure. Besides, sometimes even an afterbirth that comes up to twenty three days after a miscarriage may be still attributed to it.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose ben Shaul asked, “If a woman aborts a fetus in the shape of a raven, and an afterbirth after that, do we attribute the afterbirth to the raven-shaped fetus? Rabbi Yehudah the Prince answered, “No, since ravens don't have afterbirth, we do not attribute it.” Rabbi Yose continued, “But what if the afterbirth is attached to it?” Rabbi Yehudah said, “It is impossible.” However, he was proven wrong by a teaching that considered just such a case.

Earlier we saw <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-26-afterbirth-in-house.html">the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that an afterbirth containing a dissolved fetus is ritually pure</a>. In explaining it, Resh Lakish said, “It is similar to a corpse whose shape was obliterated, which is pure.” Rabbi Yochanan told him, “You seem to derive your opinion from the rule that a corpse that kept its shape is impure. But perhaps its ashes are even more impure!” Incidentally, how can a corpse keep its shape after cremation?  Abaye said, “In a mold of fireproof leather.” Rava said, “In a mold of a marble slab.” Ravina said, “If it was completely charred but not reduced to ashes.”
<br />
<br />
If a woman aborts either a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-14-doubtful-gender-takes.html">tumtum (indeterminate gender)</a> or an androgyne, she needs to observe the periods of birth impurity followed by a special period of purity for both a male and a female child. However, if she aborted twins, either a tumtum and a female, or an androgyne and a female, she only observes the purity periods for a female, because these are twice as long and overlap those of a male child.

If the fetus comes out dismembered or in a breach position, it is considered born when the majority of it appears. However, if it comes out in the usual manner, it is not considered born until most of its head comes out of the womb – that is, its forehead.

Niddah 29 – Abortion of Unknown Nature

That means that she is ritually impure for two weeks, like for a female child, and not one week, like for a male. 
<br />
<br />
Now this is followed by the period of ritual purity, even if she sees blood. However, the purity for a male child would start after a week and continue for forty days. Since she already observed two weeks, she is left with only twenty six days of purity. Also, we can not give her the eighty days of purity, as she would have for a female child, and this explains why we use forty days in this calculation. Thus, she receives the stringencies of both possibilities.
<br />
<br />
If it is not even known if it was a child or not, since the discharge was lost before its nature could be determined, she does not receive neither the forty pure days for a male, nor eighty for a female.

Niddah 3 – Learning the Laws of Purity from Suspected Wife

<br />
<br />
This is a situation of doubt: it is not known if she was unfaithful or not. Since seclusion is only possible in a private place, we have a rule: any doubt about purity that arose in a public place is declared pure, and in a private place it is impure. For example, if dead mole was found next to a piece of sacrificial meat, so that it might have touched it, then if this happened in a public place, the meat is pure, but in a private place it is ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
If there was a mikveh, which initially had forty seah of water (about two by two by six feet) but then was found lacking the complete amount, the purity of all objects that were dipped in it is now in doubt. First of all, this rule seems to contradict the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">retroactive impurity rule we learned before</a>. Secondly, in this case the Sages declare the objects impure – and compare this to suspected wife, who is forbidden to her husband until she proves her innocence. Rabbi Shimon also compares this to suspected wife, but derives that the objects in the public domain are pure. This leads to seeming multiple contradictions, and the Talmud resolves all of them.
<br />
<br />
<b>Definition of the term "Niddah"
</b><br />
<br />
A woman becomes a "niddah" through the discharge of uterine blood. There are two separate areas where this is important.
<br />
<br />
In the time of the Temple and a while later, when people were careful with the laws of ritual purity, she would have to guard against touching ritually clean foods, so as not to make them ritually impure. Incidentally, a man can also have a discharge which will give him a similar legal status, and this discharge is called "zivah," while he himself in this state is called a "zav."
<br />
<br />
Secondly, a niddah is prohibited to her husband with a strong prohibition of prohibited relations, and if they cohabit, they both become liable to being cut off from the spiritual source.

Niddah 30 – A Forgetful Woman

Imagine the following situation. A woman went away pregnant, but returned later without a child, and she does not recall when her pregnancy got terminated. Then she experienced three pure weeks, and afterward – ten alternating weeks, where she saw blood one week, and no blood the next week. She may cohabit with her husband on the thirty-fifth day of her arrival, and she must go to the mikveh ninety-five times in this thirteen week period – these are the words of Beit Shammai. Beit Shammai's rule is that it is a mitzvah to go to a mikveh exactly on the day when it is needed, and because of the interplay of multiple uncertainties, there ninety-five days when it might be needed. Beit Hillel don't agree to this rule, but they still find enough possible uncertainties to require her to go to the mikveh thirty-five times.
<br />
<br />
If a woman miscarried on a fortieth day after conception (which she knows because it is forty days after she went to the mikveh), she need not be concerned that it was a child, and therefore the laws of ritual impurity of childbirth do not apply to her. If, however, it is the forty-first day, she must observe all the limitations of the birth of a male, and all of the female, and a regular niddah law, as if there was no birth.<br />

The Sages argued with him based on Cleopatra's experiment when two of her maidservants were sentenced to death for an offense against the crown. She had them cohabit on the same day, then examined them on the forty-first day: one had a male, another a female, both formed. Rabbi Ishmael answered, “I am bringing a proof from the Torah, and you are responding with a proof from imbeciles!”
<br />
<br />
What is the Torah's proof? Just as the days of the mother's purity after giving birth to a female are eighty days, so too is the formation of a fetus, while it is forty days for a male. And the Sages? They say, “You cannot compare the formation of a fetus to the laws of ritual purity.” What did Rabbi Ishmael answer to the experiment? He said, “Perhaps the woman with the female was pregnant from before.” The Sages said, “Cleopatra appointed a guardian for her!” Rabbi Ishmael answered, “There is no guardian against promiscuity.”
<br />
<br />
In a different version of the story, the positions were reversed. Rabbi Ishmael was quoting the experiment, which was reported to have eighty days for a female, and the Sages were arguing against his proof.
<br />
<br />
A lamp is lit for an unborn child in its mother's womb, and he peers and sees from one end of the world to the other. They teach him the entire Torah, but as soon as the child emerges into the world, an angel comes and strikes him on the upper lip, causing him to forget it all. However, the child cannot be born until he gives an oath. They tell him to promise, “Be a good person, and don't be a bad person. However, even if the whole world tells you that you are righteous, view yourself as having achieved nothing at all.”

Niddah 32 – Cutheans

Since then lived in Samaria, they are also called Samaritans. While in Israel, they were attacked by mountain lions, and they decided to convert to Judaism. They basically followed the written Torah the way they understood it, and in these areas they were even more meticulous than the Jews. However, they differed in matters of interpretation, which caused them to observe some laws incorrectly. Eventually, it was discovered that they still served idols, and they were declared to be non-Jewish, but prior to that they were a subject of long-standing disagreements.
<br />
<br />
The Sages gave all of the female Samaritans the status of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/definition-of-term-niddah.html">niddah</a> , even while they are still very young, and all male the status of ritual impurity of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a>. &nbsp;They also considered all Cuthean males as though they cohabited with their wives while in the state of niddah.  Why is all that?
<br />
<br />
Since the Cutheans did not accept the interpretation of the Torah by the Jewish Sages, they took no notice of the repetition “Woman... woman.” The Sages understood this to mean that even a young girl may become a niddah. Therefore, if it did happen, Jews would immerse the girl in the mikveh, while the Cutheans would not. The situation with the males was the same.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Cutheans considered a woman a niddah when she had blood of any color, not just any of the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-19-four-colors.html">four colors we learned above</a>. They thought this to be an additional stringency. However, that really was a leniency: if their woman saw, for example, yellow color of blood, she would start counting her seven days – which was wrong. If she then saw red blood, it would be included in the seven-day count, which would thus finish earlier than it should. Thus, she would immerse while still a niddah, and the immersion would be infective.

Niddah 33 – Cutheans' Purity

In the same vein, if a woman had intercourse and later emitted the man's seed – as long as the seed is viable – she too becomes ritually impure for that day. We learn this from the giving of the Torah. Men were required to separate from their wives for three days in advance. Really, one day would be enough, but since seed remains alive in a woman's womb for three days, we learn from the law about a woman who emits man's seed.
<br />
<br />
Rami bar Chama asked, “What if a woman emits man's seed while she is counting her pure days, does it ruin her count?” Rava commented, “Because of Rami's sharpness, he asked a meaningless question.” However, the Talmud proves that the questions indeed had meaning.
<br />
<br />
Rav Pappa once came to the city of Tavach. He said, “If there is a smart scholar here, show him to me.” One elderly woman said, “We have a scholar, by the name of Rav Shmuel, and you should be like him.” Rav Pappa concluded, “If people bless me in his name, he must be truly a God-fearing person.”  
<br />
<br />
Rav Shmuel slaughtered an ox for Rav Pappa,  and then asked a question about Cutheans's purity that left Rav Pappa perplexed: why are their garments only doubtfully impure, while the garments of an ignoramus are definitely impure? Rav Pappa answered that we are dealing with a Cuthean Sage, but Rav Shmuel pointed out that from <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-32-cutheans.html">the rest of the story</a> it did not look like that.

Niddah 34 – Purity of Idolaters
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5nLi2tKZTmv3yTHNzxUshobpD7DQPGKr4eT55XrDOJ5yCsNRC_r_DRk_L2Re9nka3xmUEBOLQbssvPkcuuLGngrhzVHqzv1v4kVkZays8Aik3HSPx2aDX6jpgjbgJCbUEEoGGWbw8m1PU/s1600/Edward+R.+King+-+London+Street+Children.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="271" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5nLi2tKZTmv3yTHNzxUshobpD7DQPGKr4eT55XrDOJ5yCsNRC_r_DRk_L2Re9nka3xmUEBOLQbssvPkcuuLGngrhzVHqzv1v4kVkZays8Aik3HSPx2aDX6jpgjbgJCbUEEoGGWbw8m1PU/s320/Edward+R.+King+-+London+Street+Children.jpg" width="320" /></a>By Torah law, idolaters do not have the strict ritual impurity of the Jews. However, in order to distance Jewish children from the children of idolaters, the Sages decreed to treat all idolaters and idolatresses as ritually impure because of zivah, as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-32-cutheans.html">we have seen before</a>. This was not, however, a real impurity, and if holy foods came in contact with such decreed impurity, they could not be burned – since in general it is forbidden to destroy sacrificial foods. 
<br />
<br />
Therefore, the Sages now had to make a clear distinction between the ritual impurity of idolaters, which was only a decree, and that of Jews, which was the Torah law. They did it by declaring only some of the discharges of idolaters impure, but not all of them, so that it would serve as a reminder. Beit Shammai say that the uterine blood of an idolatress is pure, whether moist or dry. However, Beit Hillel gave it the impurity of other secretions, such as saliva and urine, which is impure only when moist but not when dry.
<br />
<br />
The semen of a Jew is ritually impure, and if it comes out of an idolatress, it makes her impure. The semen of a non-Jew is pure, and if it comes  out of a Jewish woman, it does not make her impure. Rav Pappa asked the question about the semen of  a Jew inside of an idolatress. But we just answered it!? He meant, after three days. We know that inside a Jewish woman it&nbsp;putrefies&nbsp;in three days and is thus pure, perhaps because she is always worried about mitzvot, which adds internal heat. This is not true about an idolatress. On the other hand, an idolatress eats various crawling creatures, and maybe that too adds heat? The question remained unresolved.

Niddah 35 – First Discharge

However, occasionally it can be caused by one of the seven conditions: food, drink, carrying a load, jumping, illness, or a sight or thought of a woman.
<br />
<br />
Rav Huna said that even when it is caused by a stimuli, it has all the laws of a regular zivah, and causes one to be ritually impure, just like semen emission, based on the Torah phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=15#P3198">This is the law concerning the zav and one from whom semen was emitted</a>.” Rav Huna's opinion is challenged with four different challenges, but he successfully answers all.
<br />
<br />
So how is zivah defined? Rav Huna gives the criteria: it is similar in consistency to water of barley dough; it issues from a limp organ, whereas semen issues from an erect one; it is runny and resembles the white of a spoiled egg, whereas semen is viscous and resembles the stark white of an unspoiled egg.
<br />
<br />
<b>Definition: Niddah and Zavah Cycles
</b><br />
<br />
A woman's initial monthly discharge renders her a niddah. Seven days after that she may immerse in a mikveh and be again permitted to her husband. 
<br />
<br />
The next eleven days after that are potential “zivah” days. Any discharge during these days renders her a “zavah.” If the discharge lasted for one or two days, she is called “minor zavah” and needs only to wait for another day free of discharge, and can go to a mikveh. However, three days of discharge render her a “major zavah.” She needs to observe seven clean days, immerse in a mikveh, and in the time of the Temple bring an offering. After that, the new cycle begins, where the next discharge will render her a niddah. 
<br />
<br />
This is the Torah law, but in later generations, due to the difficulty of observing the day counts of niddah and zivah, the custom has become to treat any discharge as requiring seven clean days after it.

In fact, she can become a niddah only in the first seven days of her cycle. Then she can go into a mikveh and be again permitted to her husband. After that begin the eleven days when blood gives her a different status, “zavah”. These 7 + 11 day cycles are <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">described here</a> for reference. Today the law is more strict, and she waits for seven days after any blood.
<br />
<br />
However, before the law changed, if a woman was giving birth not in the days when she become a niddah, then her blood does not automatically make her impure. Rather, if we are sure that this blood is due to childbirth, she remains pure. If, however, she sees blood while giving birth, and then the labor stops, this tells us that the blood was not due to imminent childbirth, and she is ritually impure as a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">zavah</a>.<br />
<br />
How long should the interruption in labor be? Rabbi Eliezer says, twenty-four hours; Rabbi Yehoshua says, a complete day, like Shabbat, from evening till next nightfall. Both derive their law from the same phrase in the Torah. We thus see that a woman can have blood during childbirth, and not acquire &nbsp;any type of ritual impurity. The Sages required her to observe one day of niddah impurity, to prevent possible counting mistakes.<br />

Niddah 37 – Rav Assi Excommunicates Shila bar Avina

<br />
<br />
However, Rav, Shmuel, and Rav Itzchak disagree on the additional limitations in the case when her labor stopped. According to Rav, she would be forbidden to her husband for that one day only. Shmuel says that she needs to observe another day free of discharge, while Rav Itzchak's opinion is that she is permitted to her husband even the same day.
<br />
<br />
Shila bar Avina ruled like Rav in an actual case. When Rav was dying, he said to Rav Assi, “Go and supress the ruling of Shila. I changed my mind and agree with Rav Itzchak: she need not wait at all. If Shila does not listen, persuade him by logic (garei). “ However, Rav Assi thought that Rav told him to excommunicate Shila (gadiei) if he does not listen. When Rav passed away, Rav Assi said to Shila, “Retract your opinion, because Rav changed his.” Shila answered, “If Rav really retracted, he would have told me himself.” Rav Assi excommunicated Shila.
<br />
<br />
Shila said to Rav Assi, “Aren't you afraid of a wrong-doing?” Rav Assi answered, “I am like a copper mortar (assisa) that is not subject to decay. Shila said, “I am analagous to an iron pestle that cracks a copper mortar.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Assi became sick, going from heat to cold and back, and ultimately passed away.  Shila said to his wife, “Prepare burial shrouds for me, as I must leave the world along with Rav Assi, so that he should not go to Rav alone and tell him derogatory things about me,” then he too passed away. At the burial, the biers of the two scholars were side by side, and people saw myrtle branch fly back and forth from one bier to the other, and said, “We see that the Sages made a reconciliation.”

Niddah 38 – The Term of Pregnancy

The normal pregnancy term in either 271 days, 272, or 273, so the birth would occur on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday. But – asks the Talmud – cohabitation on Thursday, Friday, or the Sabbath also cannot lead to a birth on the Sabbath!? – True, understand “only on Wednesdays” as “from Wednesday onward.”
<br />
<br />
What was the reasoning of the pious ones of old? In the book of Ruth it says, “And God granted her pregnancy.” Pregnancy in Hebrew is “Herayon”, הריון, with the numerical value of 5+200+10+6+50=271, to allude that the term of pregnancy is 271 days.
<br />
<br />
After giving birth to a girl, and observing the fourteen days of labor-caused ritual impurity, the woman is pure for the next sixty-six days, even if she sees blood. What happens if she became pregnant at the beginning of these pure days, but then had a miscarriage before they were up? Is the blood of this second childbirth also pure? The Sages says that indeed all her blood during those eighty days is pure. Of course, when she actually delivers a fetus, she has a different ritual impurity – that of giving birth. However, Rabbi Eliezer says that only normal blood is excluded, because it is connected to the first birth, but not this blood, which is connected to the second birth.

Not only she is permitted to her husband, without checks or doubts, but even in the times of the Temple, when those women who handled ritually pure foods, had to check themselves, this requirement was suspended during those eleven days.
<br />
<br />
However, for a man who had a zivah discharge or for a woman who had the same, this presumption is not true, and they are assumed to be ritually impure, unless they checked themselves to ascertain purity. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, if she did not check herself, she is still presumed to be pure. This last rule seems to imply that checks are needed, whereas the first rule told us that they are not!? – One explanation is that the last rules talks about the first seven days, not eleven days that follow. Talmud gives three more explanations of this difficulty, some of them ascribing this complete ruling to the stringent opinion of Rabbi Meir.

Niddah 4 – The Reasons of Shammai, Hillel, and Sages

What were their reasons?
<br />
<br />
Shammai said that if a woman sees blood, there is absolutely no ritual impurity applied to her retroactively, and that only ritually pure foods that she touches from now on will become impure. The Talmud found four possible reasons for his opinion. In the fourth approach, Shammai told to Hillel that if he declares a woman ritually impure retroactively, then he will also affect propagation and increase, because the pair will always be afraid that any blood she sees later will make her a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/definition-of-term-niddah.html">niddah</a> retroactively, and they will have transgressed.
<br />
<br />
Hillel answered that he is only talking about ritual food, something that would not apply outside the Temple or related requirements, but Shammai answered that even so they will be nervous.
<br />
<br />
The Sages felt that one position was too lenient, while the other too strict. Among their reasons was the prior Sages have established for women working with ritually pure foods a requirement to check themselves for blood every morning and evening. Since this requirement was taken seriously, they could rely on it and declare retroactive impurity only back to the previous check. If she missed a few checks, they still would not extend the impurity back more than twenty four hours, since it is inconceivable that a discharge would not be noticed for longer than that.

Caesarean (in Hebrew&nbsp;literally &nbsp;“one that exits through the wall”) refers to a fetus removed through an incision in the mother's abdominal wall. Although women often did not survive these operations in ancient times, our ruling will discuss a case in which the mother was healed.<br />
<br />
If a child was delivered by caesarean, the normal counts of the day of ritual impurity after birth, followed by a period of purity, do not apply, neither is the mother obligated to bring a sacrifice – that is the opinion of the Sages. However, Rabbi Shimon says that this child is like a child born in the normal manner, and its mother is subject to all the usual childbirth laws. What are their proofs?
<br />
<br />
The proof of the Sages is from the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=12#P3044">When a woman conceives and gives birth to a boy</a>...” This implies that the rules that follow will apply only to a case when she gives birth from the place where she conceived. Rabbi Shimon, however, bases his proof on the phrase that follows, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=12#P3047">If she gives birth to a girl</a>.” The words “gives birth” are extra, and they include caesarean.

However, as explained Rabbi Yochanan, Rabbi Shimon gives this law only to people. An animal born by caesarean is not considered normal birth, and such animal cannot be consecrated as sacrifice. Why not? Rabbi Shimon compared this to a firstborn animal: just as a firstborn “opens the womb,” so too a sacrificial animal should be born by “opening the womb.” And why does Rabbi Shimon compare the two laws at all? – Because in the description of both the term “birth” was used.
<br />
<br />
But Rabbi Shimon should rather compare the birth of animals to that of humans, because there also the term “birth” is used! The result would be that an animal born by caesarean will qualify as a sacrifice. No! Rabbi Shimon compares the sacrifices to first-born animals, because they are similar in that the term “mother” is used for both, and the laws of wrong thoughts, wrong time, and impurity apply. And still, he should compare to humans, since the words “male,” “consecrated,” and “gift” was used for both, and because their laws apply to regular, not consecrated beings. Comparison to animals wins by count of five-to-four.

However, while his impurity comes when the semen leaves his body, her impurity  comes while the semen is on its way out, even before it leaves her body. Why? About the blood the Torah said, “in her flesh” - that is, already in her flesh, before it leaves the body, and about semen it said, “it will be,” giving it the same law. However, Rabbi Shimon says that her law should be just like his, that is, she does not become ritually impure until his semen actually leaves her body.
<br />
<br />
“Swallowed-up impurity” is a ritually impure object enclosed in a hidden bodily cavity, such as the stomach. This impurity is considered non-existent. “Concealed place impurity” is a ritually impure object places in a partly concealed such as an ear, nostril, or armpit. What is the status of a ritually impure object in “that place” of a woman? The Talmud asks, what's the difference? And it answers, swallowed-up impurity has no effect at all, but concealed-place impurity makes one who carries it impure. So if her friend inserted a peace of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a> meat there, her ritual purity status would depend on the answer to this question. Rava said, “It is swallowed up, and she is pure,” while Abaye said, “It is concealed, and she is impure when she moves.” 
<br />
<br />
A similar question: if a person's friend inserted an olive's volume of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a> meat in his mouth, is it swallowed-up or concealed? Here Abaye and Rava reverse their opinions.

What is the source for this law? The Torah said about him, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=15#P3168">Any man who will have a discharge from his flesh</a>...” – from his flesh and not in his flesh, to tell us that it has to be out “from his flesh.” 
<br />
<br />
Thus, if a Kohen was eating his holy portion (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/meila-16-how-prohibited-foods-combine.html">terumah</a>), and he felt his limbs trembling, he grasps the male organ, to prevent semen from exiting his body, and quickly swallows the terumah food. But how could he do it? We learned that one <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-13-touching.html">should not touch his member</a>!? Abaye answered, “He grasps it with a thick cloth, as it does not cause additional arousal.” Rava said, “Even thin cloth, since no additional semen will be emitted on account of it,” and those with whom it will are anyway a minority.
<br />
<br />
On the subject of “trembling of the limbs,” Shmuel said: “Any semen that is emitted without being felt throughout one's body does not convey ritual impurity.” Another version of what Shmuel said, “Any seed that does not shoot forth like an arrow cannot fertilize.” According to the second version, semen that exits without a feeling cannot fertilize but still produces impurity.

She remains in that state for seven days, after which immersion in a mikveh renders her pure. The earliest she can become a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">zavah</a>&nbsp;is on the tenth day: she enters the potential zivah days on day number eight, and three days of discharge then would render her a zavah.
<br />
<br />
A boy can become ritually impure as a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a>&nbsp;also on his first day: a male becomes a zav through two or more discharges of special sort of gonorrheal emission. Both male and female infants can become a metzora (spiritual leper), or receive ritual impurity of a corpse on the first day of their lives.<br />
<br />
A child of one day releases his mother from yibum (levirate marriage): if a man dies childless, his brother should marry his wife, now a widow, or release her with a formal procedure of removing a show and spitting, known as chalitzah. A child, even if it was born after his father's death, and even if it lived for a short time, makes his father not childless, and makes his mother free to marry anyone she wants. Conversely, if the child's brother died, that child binds his brother's widow with the yibum obligation, and she will have to wait till he becomes thirteen, to give her a halitzah. It is enough for them to co-exist in life for even one day.<br />

The preferred way is for the girl to grow up and decide on her own, but this legal right gives her father a way to arrange the marriage early, which in view of persecutions and short lifespan was often beneficial. Thus, a minor girl may be legally considered a married woman, even while she continues to live with her family until she grows up.
<br />
<br />
At the age of three, she creates a legal responsibility for anyone who cohabits with her – he is liable for adultery, although she is not, until she reaches the bat mitzvah age. In the same vein, if her prospective husband dies, his brother has an obligation to take her as a wife, effected as yibum (levirate marriage), and that can happen even when she is a minor. If she does not want him, she can give him a release (halitzah), but only when she is a bat mitzvah.
<br />
<br />
A boy can effect yibum from the age of nine: if his adult brother, who has the legal capacity to marry a woman, does so, but then dies, then this woman is connected to him because of his older brother, and this connection is what allows him to marry her. However, to receive a halitzah, or to give a Get (divorce), he needs to be a bar mitzvah.
<br />
<br />
The vows of a girls are binding one year prior to her bat mitzvah, if it is clear that she understands the consequences of her words. For the boy this age starts at one year before bar mitzvah.

Niddah 46 – When Does One Become Bat- or Bar-Mitzvah
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeotc14LLcHmgTFouvxKpBp_ODElgZYkMRFHaTfQTWohD2x_tThgTUo-bwvfDV0frEfjTQ40jGGBnT0IyZeg5sGO6tn4GWzsSw24lZBLCF9GjD9-sNlna1mWalENweaHknL6CSIwtJllqn/s1600/Albert+Anker+-+Portrait+of+a+Young+Boy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeotc14LLcHmgTFouvxKpBp_ODElgZYkMRFHaTfQTWohD2x_tThgTUo-bwvfDV0frEfjTQ40jGGBnT0IyZeg5sGO6tn4GWzsSw24lZBLCF9GjD9-sNlna1mWalENweaHknL6CSIwtJllqn/s320/Albert+Anker+-+Portrait+of+a+Young+Boy.jpg" width="252" /></a>A boy becomes an adult (bar mitzvah - son of the mitzvah) at thirteen years and one day, while a girl becomes a bat mitzvah (daughter of the mitzvah) at twelve and one day – these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. However, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds just the opposite: a girl at thirteen, and a boy at twelve. What are their respective proofs?
<br />
<br />
The reason of Rabbi Yehudah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=2#P53">God built the rib that he took from the man into a woman</a>...” The word “built”, “vayiven” is connected to “binah” - understanding, to tell us that women are inherently more intelligent and reach the level of mental maturity earlier than men do. And Rabbi Shimon, how does he explain this word? He says, “built” means that God braided Eve's hair, and indeed in cities by the sea they called a braided coiffure a “building.”
<br />
<br />
In addition to being thirteen, the boy, to be considered a bar mitzvah, must have grown two pubic hairs.  If he grows them before he is thirteen, they are not considered as anything, and are presumed to have grown from a mole in his skin. If he grows them after he is thirteen, then he is a full-fledged adult. If it is not known when the hairs grew, then – if we don't use the view that if he grew them before thirteen, they count even now – his real status is in doubt. However, since a majority of boys do grow two hairs after they become thirteen and one day, we can presume that the boy in question is the same. This majority-determined status is sufficient for most laws, save for the some exceptional cases.

Niddah 47 – Metaphor of a Fig

These are childhood (legal minor), girlhood (intermediate, quasi-adult stage, “naarut”), and full adulthood (“bagrut”). Childhood for a girl ends at twelve years and one day, and similarly for a boy it ends at thirteen and one day. Then, if she has the signs of maturity (two pubic hairs), the girl becomes semi-adult (“naarah”). Full adulthood begins six months after that. What are the sources for this metaphor? Bud is mentioned in the Song of Songs, “The fig tree has formed its buds.” Small fig – from a ruling on when one has to give tithes from figs. A ripe fig, “tzemel” is an abbreviation of “yatzata maleah” - she went out full.
<br />
<br />
Which are the signs of full legal adulthood? Rabbi Yose HaGlili says, “From when a fold forms under the breast.”Rabbi Akiva says, “When the breasts hang down.” Ben Azzai says, “When the areola darkens.” Rabbi Yose says, “When the breast is large enough so that if she puts her hand on the nipple, it sinks and delays return.”
<br />
<br />
The Talmud gives four more signs of maturity. They asked Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, which sign of maturity should be used to determine full adulthood? He answered, “All of them, to determine a stringency in the law.” For example, with any of these signs, father loses the right to annul his daughter's vows.

Niddah 48 – A Minor That Never Grows Up
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqh9_GxITUdwGXZiXZ7prTJ6gurUdPt9A0y8uRPJ3vAMoFm3XqFWs-J1lxZuAyPX9MBEIZkrS3gErx_M5ZCm2gOB_8CJ3_SbhQ322su2-wQKambb-O8DI5RLNCCKcU5fDXwimavymfFhoI/s1600/Rembrandt+Van+Rijn+-+A+youth+in+a+cap+and+gorget.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqh9_GxITUdwGXZiXZ7prTJ6gurUdPt9A0y8uRPJ3vAMoFm3XqFWs-J1lxZuAyPX9MBEIZkrS3gErx_M5ZCm2gOB_8CJ3_SbhQ322su2-wQKambb-O8DI5RLNCCKcU5fDXwimavymfFhoI/s320/Rembrandt+Van+Rijn+-+A+youth+in+a+cap+and+gorget.jpg" width="270" /></a>In some rare cases a male or a female never completely matures. This changes some marital laws for them, thus, if a female is twenty but has not sprouted two pubic hairs, she must bring a proof of her age, and will then be considered as forever immature (“aylonit”): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a> &nbsp;(levirate marriage) cannot be done to her, and she does not require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a> and can marry anyone if her husband dies. Similarly, a man who is twenty but has not sprouted two pubic hairs, must bring a proof of his age, and he then need not perform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a> or be the subject of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a>.
<br />
<br />
The lower sign (two pubic hairs) always comes before the upper sign (breast development). When the lower sign is present, the girl can do either halitzah or yibum, and when the upper sign (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-47-metaphor-of-fig.html">small fig stage of development</a>) is present, we can presume the same – these are the words of the Sages. However, Rabbi Meir disagrees on two counts. If the upper sign is present, according to Rabbi Meir it means nothing, so she cannot halitzah, which only adults can do. And although minor can do yibum, Rabbi Meir does not allow it for a different reason: a minority of people never mature, and Rabbi Meir, who always takes a statistical minority into account, is apprehensive that the girl or a boy will never mature, and their yibum would retroactively violate a serious prohibition, so according to Rabbi Meir they must wait till they fully mature.
<br />
<br />
When an examination of a girl was required, it was done by a woman.<br />

By analogy, if a vessel lets water in, it surely lets water out, but there can be a vessel that lets water out but not in. What's the difference? If it lets water out, it is still a vessel, albeit a leaky one, and can be used to hold purification water of the ashes of red heifer, to remove the impurity of the dead body. However, if it lets water in, it is not a vessel anymore, and will not purify.
<br />
<br />
An extra finger, if it has a fingernail, surely has a bone, but there can be an extra finger with a bone but without a fingernail. To what law does this refer? If it has a fingernail, then even if it is very small, it is a full-fledged limb, and transmits the impurity of the dead body when under the same roof. However, if it does not have a fingernail, then it it only transmits impurity because of the bone in it, which is the impurity of touching and carrying it, but not of the roof.
<br />
<br />
Any vessel receptive of impurity from a man who had an emission (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a>) sitting on it, is also receptive to the impurity of the dead body. However, the other way around is not true: if a vessel is so large that it is not designated for sitting, it does not become impure when a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a> sits on it, since they can tell him “stand up, and let us do our work.”

<br />
<br />
If a woman checks herself for blood before and after marital relations, then this check also counts to prevent retroactive food impurity. If the teacher did not tells us this rule, we could have thought that before relations she is rushing “to her house,” that is, to be with her husband, and won't inspect properly. After relations, we could have thought that a small drop of blood the size of a mustard seed may be covered by semen. Therefore, the teacher had to tell us both cases.

<br />
<br />
Everyone who is qualified to judge is qualified to testify, but there are some who are qualified to testify but not to judge. Who is they? – One who is blind in one eye – he cannot be a judge. However, this is only the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who derived it from the Torah's use of the word, “on the day” talking about the laws of money judgments and of spiritual leprosy: just as the leper must be examined with “the entire sight of the Kohen,” so too the judge must have complete vision.
<br />
<br />
Anything that is subject to tithing (that is, food), can also convey ritual impurity of food. However, there are types of food that convey impurity, but they are not subject to tithing, namely, meat, fish, and eggs – because they don't grow from the ground.
<br />
<br />
Anything that is subject to pe'ah (leaving over the corners of a field for the poor) is also subject to tithing, but there are things that are subject to pe'ah but not to tithing, that is, figs and vegetables. Why not these? Because pe'ah is only left from food that is collected in one harvest (not figs) and that does not spoil when stored (not vegetables).

Every seven year in Israel there is&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;– no plowing or&nbsp;harvesting (there are different opinions as to whether it applies nowadays). One can collect fruit and vegetables for his own use though, but when there is no more of that species available in the fields, he has to take his supply into the street also, and declare it ownerless, free for all to take. Any species that one is obligated to make ownerless (this is called “removal”), he is also obligated to observe other&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;laws with, such as not&nbsp;using it for commerce and treating them in a special way. However, mint root, for instance, is always available, because it is underground, so although there are&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;laws for it, there is no “removal”&nbsp;requirement.

There are multiple opinions on where these hairs must be, but the accepted view is that they must be in the pubic area. At this time, the girl can perform the ritual of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a>, and the boy becomes eligible for the punishment of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/04/sanhedrin-69-age-of-wayward-and.html">rebellious son</a>. He stops being punishable as a rebellious son when his beard grows around. This really means the bottom (pubic) beard, and only a first ring of hair there, but the Sages employed a euphemism.
<br />
<br />
Two hairs are also found in the laws of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/09/avodah-zarah-24-making-of-red-heifer.html">red heifer</a>, where the cow must have no more than two non-red hairs, and in the laws of spiritual leprosy, where two hairs in the affected area turning white indicate the affliction. How long do the hairs have to be? Enough to bend their top to the root – these are the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Elazar says, long enough to be grabbed by a fingernail. Rabbi Akiva says, long enough to be removed with a scissors. And the law? It follows all views for stringency. This means that once the shortest length is reached, the child is not a child anymore, but to become full adult, they wait till the hairs are of the largest size of those mentioned above.

The characteristics of these cycles are summarized for reference <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">here</a>. If a woman finds a blood stain on her clothing, and she does not know when it happened, then her count is messed up. 
<br />
<br />
Since she is unaware on which day the blood was discharged from her uterus, she does not know when her seven-day niddah period begins, and consequently, cannot know when her eleven-day zivah period will start. She would have to wait out seven days after she finds a stain, and then begin her eleven-day count, but if more discharges happen during this time, there are multiple possible counting scenarios, and it is not known which one is true. Therefore, she will have to wait for enough pure days to be out of all doubts.
<br />
<br />
The idea of a stain impurity was established by the Sages. From the Torah, the woman is only ritually impure as a niddah and forbidden to her husband if she felt the sensation. Thus, if she finds a stain and does not know when it happened, obviously she did not feel it, and thus the Torah would not consider her a niddah. The Sages, who established this law, also limited it to stains larger than a lentil, because smaller sizes can be attributed to other sources.

Niddah 54 – Twilight

We have also seen an <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-52-stain.html">example of a confusion that may arise</a> when we don't know, in which of the two periods an event has occurred.<br />
<br />
Another example of such confusion leading to a messed up count is the case of a woman who experienced a discharge during the twilight of the eleventh day of her zivah period. Twilight is that period when the day ends and the night begins, and a twilight moment might belong to the previous day, or already to the next day, since <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=1#p5">night is the beginning of the day</a>. If her discharge occurred during the day, then it would belong to the last, eleventh day of her zivah cycle, when she only needs to wait one day after a discharge. However, if her discharge occurred at night, it would belong to the next, seven-day cycle of possible niddah. In that case, she will have to wait seven days before going to the mikveh. Since it is impossible to determine the nature of twilight, she will have not choice but to wait out seven days.
<br />
<br />
However, even after that, there is still a possible confusion. If she discharges blood on the eighth day, this might be the first day of the zivah, and then she has only to wait one day, or it could be a beginning of the new niddah period, if the previous wait was really unnecessary. Because of all these factors, she has to wait for seventeen days. However, there is never a need to wait for longer, as we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/arachin-8-minimum-and-maximum-amounts.html">mentioned in the Tractate Arachin</a>.

These include the emission of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a> (a special white discharge from a male member), his phlegm and saliva, creepy crawly animals (such as rats), an animal carcass, and human semen. Others, however, convey impurity both while moist and also when dry, and this includes the blood of a niddah, and the flesh of a corpse.
<br />
<br />
Even those substances about which we said that they loose their capacity to convey impurity when dry (such a spit of a zav), if they can be soaked and regain their nature, in such instances they continue to convey impurity even when dry. How long should they be soaked for this test? – In warm water, for a full day.
<br />
<br />
How are these laws derived? From extra words or letters in the Torah. For example, when the Torah said, “Zav and his emission,” or literally “emission of his,” the extra words “of his” teach that his emission is compared to him in the degree of impurity that it conveys.

If such a dead crawler was found in an alley, then ritually pure objects in this alley are declared retroactively impure: perhaps the crawler that is&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">found&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">now could have been there for several days, and could have touched the pure object. However, if someone can make a statement, “I checked this alley on that day, and it was free of such crawling animals,” then the retroactive impurity stops and does not go beyond this day. Also, if someone swept the alley, then there is no suspicion that the animal was there before: we have to assume that he swept away all impurities, and it could only appear there after sweeping.</span><br />
<br />
In a similar vein, a bloodstain on a tunic renders ritually pure objects impure back in time, but only till the moment that one says, “I checked this tunic, and it did not have a bloodstain on it,” or until the last time it was laundered.

These areas would include her heel or the big toe, because they can either potentially come close to the genitals or be right across. However, if the stain is on an area of her flesh that is not directly opposite the genitals, she is ritually pure. If it is on her leg or her foot, then if it on the inside (facing the other leg), she is ritually impure, otherwise, she is pure. 
<br />
<br />
If she finds it on her tunic, then if it is from the belt down – she is ritually impure, and from the belt up – she is pure. If it is on the sleeve, and that sleeve reaches opposite the genitals – she is ritually impure, if not, she is pure. If she is accustomed to take off her tunic and cover herself with it at night when sleeping, then no matter where the stain is found, she would be ritually impure, because the tunic moves around during the night (unless she tied it to her head).

However, in the end it answers for Shmuel that the Sages, who established the laws in regard to stains, formulated it similar to other laws of ritual purity, and ground does not ever become impure.
<br />
<br />
If a woman finds a stain but can attribute it to any other possible source, she should; for example, if she slaughtered an animal or a bird, if she handled garments with bloodstains on them, or if she sat next to people who handed such garments. She may attribute it to her son or her husband, if they were bloodstained or handled blood.
<br />
<br />
There was an incident with a certain woman who came before Rabbi Akiva and said, “I found a stain.” He asked her, “Perhaps you had a wound?” She replied, “Yes, but it healed.” He then said, “Perhaps if you moisten it, it will bring forth blood?” She answered, “Yes,” in he declared her ritually pure. He saw that his students were looking at each other and told them, “Why is this difficult in your eyes? The Sages who enacted the laws of stains did it with the provision to be treated leniently.”

Niddah 59 – Attending to One's Needs

However, Rabbi Yose says that in either case she is pure.
<br />
<br />
What is the logic of Rabbi Meir? He says that a woman who is urinating while standing does it out of a pressing need. In her desire to hold the urine&nbsp;back, she might have caused some of it to backwash into the uterus and bring some uterine blood with it. When she was sitting, however, this is not a concern.  And Rabbi Yose? He says that the backwashing scenario has a very small probability, and most likely the blood is from a wound in the urinary tract, which does not render her &nbsp;ritually impure.<br />
<br />
If a man and a woman urinated into the same basin, and later blood was found in the urine, then Rabbi Yose says that she is ritually pure. If in the case above, where the blood came from a woman, but the source of it was not certain, Rabbi Yose declared her pure, then all the more so here, where it might possibly come from a man, he should declare her pure. That ruling we could have deduced on our own. However, Rabbi Shimon declares her impure, since it is more common for blood to come from a woman.

This is because it might be uterine blood, and it is not known when it came. This case is thus stricter than the previous ones we discussed. To what does this ritual impurity applies? To food and drinks. However, it is only a doubtful impurity, imposed by the Sages as a precaution, thus although the foods are not eaten, they cannot be burned either – as is done with regular holy foods that became impure.
<br />
<br />
This impurity imposed by the Sages applies only to the holy foods of the Temple, but not to regular foods. Rav Huna added that it does not apply to terumah – the Kohen's portion of the produce. They challenged Rav Huna based on the following story.
<br />
<br />
It happened that a maidservant in the house of Rabban Gamliel was baking breads of the Kohen's portion. Between every loaf, she would wash the hands and examine herself. After the last loaf she discovered that she was impure, and Rabban Gamliel rules all the bread impure. She argued, “Didn't I examine myself after every loaf?!” – and Rabban Gamliel said, “If so, they are all pure.” In this story, the breads were terumah, Kohen's portion, and impurity applied! – while Rav Huna said that it should not!? Rav Huna would say, “It was the portion given to the Kohen from the thanksgiving offering.”

The other woman does not loose anything thereby: if she already&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">was</span><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;a niddah, this does not change her status, and if she was a gentile, who does not observe these laws, the Sages presumed that she is a niddah at all times.</span><br />
<br />
However, if three women who were ritually pure wore a single tunic one after another, and afterwards blood was found on it, none of them can blame the other with certainty, and not being able to shift the possible responsibility, they all three becomes ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
If they sat on a stone bench, though, they are all ritually pure, because, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-58-attribution.html">as we saw earlier</a>, any object that does not accept ritual impurity, does not affect the stains either. Rabbi Nechemyah formulated a rule: “Anything that is not susceptible to ritual impurity is not susceptible to stains.” His general rule includes even such cases as sitting on the outside of a clay vessels, since clay vessels do not receive their ritual impurity by contact with their outside surface.

If three women were sleeping in one bed, and blood was found beneath one of them, all three are ritually impure. Since the blood could have come from any one of them, we have no reason to attribute it to one rather than to another. However, if one examined herself and found blood, then only she is impure, but the other ones are pure, since they both attribute it to this one. If one was pregnant and not normally menstruating, the other two are impure, but if all three were pregnant, then again, each one is ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
If three women were sleeping in a bed – but we just had such a case! – there, they were pressed against each other, but here there is some distance – and blood was found under the middle one (the bed is against the wall), then all three are ritually impure. However, if it was found under the one farthest from the wall, then two are impure, but the one next to the wall is pure.
<br />
<br />
There was a vast area in Beit Choron where the land was like rock, and people knew that someone was buried there, but could not locate the source of impurity. One Sage told them to bring sheets, spread them out, and places where a corpse was buried became wet. Incidentally, these were people killed by Gedaliah, which led to the Exile. But Gedaliah was righeous, he could not have killed them! True, but since he refused to listen to a warning of a plot, it is as if he killed them. But Gedaliah had a reason: <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/arachin-15-how-bad-is-bad-talk.html">one should not believe bad talk</a>!? – Yes, but one is allowed to suspect that it is true, and needs to check it out.

Niddah 62 – Seven Cleansing Agents

If it may come in contact with ritually pure foods, it requires immersion in a mikveh. Prior to this immersion, however, one must nullify the blood by rubbing it with seven cleansing agents. If it was indeed blood, it will be removed or it will fade out,  and if it was some kind of a dye, it will stay, but dye is not a source of ritual impurity and thus is not a problem. If he does not nullify the blood, immersing it in the mikveh does not help, since the impurity of a stain remains.<br />
<br />
The seven agents are saliva (spit before one ate anything in the morning), split bean water, urine (left for three days), alum (sodium carbonate), aloe, detergent (possibly, saltwort), and ashlag. What is ashlag? Shmuel said, “I asked all seafarers, and that said that it is found in the crevices of pearls, and is removed with an iron nail.”
<br />
<br />
All cleansing agents have to be applied in the order listed, or else the test is inconclusive. If he applied them out of sequence, or all seven simultaneously, he has not accomplished anything.

Niddah 63 – Fixed Period

However, for those women who do have a fixed period, some laws will be different. What is a fixed period? The typical fixed period is when a woman begins her discharge at the same time repeatedly. For example, if for three consecutive months the woman begins her period on the fifth day of the month, she has established a fixed period. Alternatively, if she begins her period twenty one day after the previous, she has established a pattern.
<br />
<br />
But we did learn about fixed periods <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-5-fixed-period.html">also, at the beginning of the Tractate</a>!? True, but here we are learning not only about time-based, but also about periods based on physical condition.<br />
<br />
A different form of a fixed period is one accompanied by certain physical conditions, such as continuous stretching, yawning, or belching, sneezing, feeling pain in the area of her navel or in her lower abdomen, fever or shivers, heaviness of the head or of the body. If she feels any of these, and they are accompanied by a period, and this happens three times in a row – she has established a fixed period dependent on physical factors.
<br />
<br />
In all of these cases where a woman has a fixed period, her law actually has a leniency: if she was preparing ritually pure foods and saw blood, she does not have to suspect that this blood was actually there from before, but she is ritually impure only from now on. There is no retroactive twenty-four hour period of impurity.

If it usually comes at the beginning, and she discovered blood at a later time, it is presumed that it really came at the onset of the symptoms, and therefore all ritually pure foods that she handled since then are declared impure retroactively. However, if the blood usually appears at the end of the symptoms, all the foods that she handled prior are still ritually pure.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose says that even hours count, and if, for example, she is used for her period to come at six hours on a certain day, it can be assumed every next time the blood also comes at the sixth hour. This has relevance to ritually pure food, but also to the couple's marital relations. For example, if she is accustomed to experience a discharge at sunrise, she is permitted to cohabit until sunrise. However, Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that only complete days count, so in our example, she is permitted to cohabit the entire day prior to her fixed period, but is forbidden with the coming of the night.

This blood, of course, is not menstrual blood, and it does not render her either ritually impure or prohibited to her husband. Moreover, since the wound may take some time to heal, quite often a newlywed virgin may continue to experience bleeding for some time. How long can the blood be attributed to this, and after what time must one suspect that this is blood of a menstrual cycle, is discussed in the following rulings.
<br />
<br />
If a young girl whose time to discharge blood has not yet arrives (before twelve) gets married, then Beit Shammai give her the four nights  during which all blood is deemed to be hymen blood, but Beit Hillel extend this until the wound heals. If her time to discharge blood arrived, but she has not seen blood yet (between twelve and twelve-and-a-half), and she got married, then Beit Shammai give her the first night, but Beit Hillel give her four nights, until Shabbat (as marriages usually happened on Wednesday). Finally, if she already experienced menstrual cycles before she got married, then Beit Shammai give her only the first cohabitation – which is a mitzvah – but Beil Hillel give her the entire first night.

Niddah 66 – Modern Law

Rav Chisda objected, “But it once happened that Rabbi Yehudah the Prince gave a newlywed virgin bride four nights, and these were spread out over twelve month!” The Talmud interjects – Rav Chisda should have asked from the ruling that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-65-first-night.html">we just learned</a>, which makes the distinction of age!  Rav Chisda preferred to base his question on a practical case, which is more authoritative, rather then on a theoretical ruling. But in any case, there is a contradiction!?
<br />
<br />
The answer is that Rav and Shmuel were talking about the law as it was established later, and the one that is active today. Since not everybody is familiar with all the laws of a virgin bride, and since there is also a concern that the husband's desire for his wife might overwhelm him, the Sages decided to give all virgin brides the law of the most stringent case of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-65-first-night.html">those discussed above</a>. Thus, all virgin brides are given only the first mitzvah-cohabitation.
<br />
<br />
Another stringency that arose in later generations: Rabbi Zeira said, “Jewish women have accepted upon themselves the stringency that even if they see a drop of uterine blood the size of a mustard seed, they wait seven clean days because of it.”

Niddah 67 – A Woman Immerses in a Mikveh

This is derived from the immersion of a metzora, spiritual leper, about whom the Torah says, “and he will immerse his flesh in water.” Since the immersion is done in water as a matter of course, then the word “water” teaches exactly that law, that nothing should interpose between him and the water. Thus, there is a requirement to examine one's body and hair for interposition. In addition, the Sages established that a woman should also scrub, or shampoo, her hair before immersion. 
<br />
<br />
In regards to this, Rava taught six specific laws, such as that while scrubbing the hair, she should not use anything that makes hairs stick together; that only warm water should be used, since cold water stiffens the hair and makes it more difficult to clean; and that she should wash the folds of her body, such as armpits, to remove any interposition. But we learned in the laws of mikveh that water does not need to enter folded areas! – True, but just as with flour offering, where blending is not critical, if it can be accomplished, but critical if it cannot, so here too, water does not have to enter there, but it must be able to, otherwise, the immersion does not work.

(That, of course, is the Torah law, but we mentioned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-66-modern-law.html">the modern law</a> is more uniform, though more stingent). When does she need to perform this conclusive examination?
<br />
<br />
If she examined herself in the morning of the seventh day, and found herself to be pure from blood, then she is presumed to be so later. Even if she did not perform an additional examination at twilight, and after several days she examined herself and found blood, she is presumed to be pure in the interim, and the ritually pure foods that she handled after immersion are definitely pure. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees, and requires an examination right next to the end of the seventh day, because he suspects that the flow of blood may have resumed after morning examination. However, the Sages give a definite lenient ruling: even if she examined herself at the beginning of the second day, and found herself pure, she has the presumption of purity from then on.

But – the Talmud asks – all dead bodies convey spiritual impurity through carrying!? – Well, here we are dealing with a case where a corpse lay on a massive, immobile stone. Since this stone is very heavy, then an object below the stone it does not really “carry” the corpse on top of it, and thus this object does not become ritually impure because of the corpse. However, if this corpse belongs to a zav, then the object under the stone does become ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
In truth, the corpse of a zav does not transmit ritual impurity either. It is the Sages, who decreed that it does, because this may be confused with a live zav, lying on the top of the stone. The concern was that if a dead zav does not carry ritual impurity, then people may confuse him with a live zav who fainted, who does carry impurity. To prevent this confusion, the Sages decrees that a dead zav should have the same impurity as the live one would.

They are a virgin who never saw blood, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman, and an old woman. The Talmud goes on to define the exact age and time events for them. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua said, “I heard this law only in regard to a virgin, but not in regard the other three enumerated by Rabbi Eliezer." Rabbi Eliezer answered him, “You did not hear it from your teachers, but I did hear from mine. Do we ask to testify about a new moon the one who did not see it, or the one who saw it?” While Rabbi Eliezer was alive, the law followed Rabbi Yehoshua, but after Rabbi Eliezer's passing, Rabbi Yehoshua returned the law to follow Rabbi Eliezer. 
<br />
<br />
Why did Rabbi Yehoshua do it? He reasoned that if they were to follow Rabbi Eliezer in this law, where his view was indeed the correct one, then people might follow Rabbi Eliezer even in other areas, where he might have been wrong. If that happened, Rabbi Yehoshua would not be able to stop them:  Rabbi Eliezer was under a ban and forbidden to defend his view, and Rabbi Yehoshua would not feel right to speak when he was allowed to, while Rabbi Eliezer would be forbidden it, out of respect for Rabbi Eliezer. After Rabbi Eliezer's passing, this was no longer a concern.

<br />
<br />
They asked about a woman who was divorced, married someone else, and then remarried her first husband. Since that is prohibited by the Torah, what is the status of her daughter – can she marry a Kohen? Do we compare her to a widow who married a High Priest, which is prohibited, and whose daughter cannot marry a Kohen, and do we say that our case is surely worse? Or do we say that our case is better, since a widow married to a High Priest is herself disqualified to marry another Kohen, but our divorcee, although already prohibited to marry a Kohen, can still eat the Kohen's portion, if she is a daughter of a Kohen? He answered, from the Torah's use of the word, “She is abomination when remarried to her first husband” – only she, but not her daughter.
<br />
<br />
They asked him about a moral lesson. In Ezekiel it says that God "does not desire the death of a wicked man,” but about the sinful sons of Eli it says, “For God desired to kill them?!” He answered that in the first case they were open to repentance, but in the second they were not.
<br />
<br />
They asked him a stupid question, “Does the wife of Lot transmit ritual impurity of the dead?” He answered, “She is pure salt, and salt does not have any impurity.”
<br />
<br />
They asked, “What should a man do to become wise?” He answered, “Study more, and limit his business.” They asked, “Many have done that, and yet this has not helped them.” He answered, “They should also plead for mercy from Him to Whom wisdom belongs.”

Niddah 71 – A Woman Who Died

However, it carries the ritual impurity of a stain. It also has the ritual impurity of a corpse, and has the capacity to make people and items under the same roof ritually impure. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: since it is not blood niddah, it does not have this ritual impurity. And, if there is less than a “reviit” of it, it has no ritual impurity of a dead either. The first teacher agrees that it is not blood niddah, and if so, why does he assign any impurity to it? He and Rabbi Yehudah disagree about “is vs. becomes”: is uterine blood ritually impure while in the uterus, or does it becomes so when it comes out.
<br />
<br />
A woman who has given birth and who is in her “pure” days, when even if she sees blood, this does not render her ritually impure (thirty-three days for a boy, and sixty-six for a girl) has the right to eat the second tithe, just like any "immersed today" person - who was impure, went to a mikveh this day, and is awaiting for sunset to become completely pure. This is considered her “extended day” of waiting for complete purity. Afterwards, she brings her childbirth sacrifice, goes to a mikveh, and then she resumes eating the sacrifices.

Niddah 72 – Eleventh Day

During the next eleven days, if she sees blood, she is not called a niddah, but a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">zavah</a>.  Now she only has to wait for one day, and immerse in the mikveh the next morning. However, if she sees blood on the following day, the two days now combine, and her immersion in nullified. Therefore, the correct behavior in the eleven days of the zivah period is to wait until the end of the following day, and immerse in the mikveh then.
<br />
<br />
Our ruling is concerned with the eleventh day itself, when, should the woman see blood on the day following, twelfth one, the two days would not combine, and her early immersion in the mikveh would not be nullified. In that particular case, the woman saw blood on the eleventh day, went to the mikveh at night, not waiting till daybreak, and then had relations with her husband. Beit Shammai nevertheless give the couple all the stringencies of the regular zavah: both make objects ritually impure,  and both have to bring a sacrifice. Beit Shammai extend the laws of the previous ten days to the eleventh one. However, Beit Hillel consider them non-guilty from the Torah point of view, and tell them not to bring a sacrifice. The Sages, however, had declared them ritually impure, to prevent this situation.
<br />
<br />
We will see the different sides of the argument on the next, concluding page of the Talmud.

Niddah 73 – Where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel Agree

The two schools agree, however, on the laws of the previous ten days.<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel, “Why is the eleventh day different?” Beit Hillel answered, “Because the flow on the next day would be that of niddah, not zivah, and not combined with this day.” Beit Shammai continued, “But you do give her some of the ritual impurity laws! So the eleventh day is the same as the ten days before!?” Beit Hillel answered, “We talk only about the impurity decreed by the Sages, but not an actual sacrifice obligation because you can't bring it on your own, without the Torah telling you.”
<br />
<br />
What is the actual source for the zavah laws in the Torah? - The phrase "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=15#P3185">When a woman has a discharge of blood, she is ritually impure (niddah) for seven days</a>" – teaches after the seven days she cannot be a nidah, only a zavah. But maybe a discharge during the day renders her  a niddah, and at night – a zavah? No, that's cannot be, since the Torah said, “After her niddah period.”
<br />
<br />
The Talmud ends on a teaching from the academy of Elijah: Whoever learns practical Torah laws every day (and some say, whoever learns hard, or whoever learns complicated laws like these of niddah, or whoever changes these laws every day) – such a person has their next world prepared. Why? Habakkuk says, “The ways of the world are His.” The word “ways” (halichot) can be read as laws (halachot).

In regard to this, Shmuel said, “The law in general follows Rabbi Eliezer in four cases, and the above is one of them.” But in each of these cases, the ruling itself included the words, “And the law is like Rabbi Eliezer.” Why did Shmuel have to teach us the obvious? – That is exactly what Shmuel is telling us: just because the earlier ruling (Mishna) states that the law follows a certain Sage, we cannot say  that this is necessarily true, since later rulings (Talmud) may change this, or establish it in only a specific limited situation. Thus, we cannot rely on our partial learning, but must have the totality of all the rules in front of us.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then lists the other three cases, dealing with the discharge of a woman, discharge of a man, and the outside surface of a vessel that has become ritually impure through a liquid – that it can make other liquids impure, but not foods. But aren't there more cases!? – True, but Shmuel meant only in the laws of purity. But even there, there are more!? – Shmuel meant only cases where nobody else supports Rabbi Eliezer, and the law follows him based on his authority alone.

Niddah 9 – Definitions of a Virgin, Pregnant, Nursing, and Old Women

However, this type of virgin is someone who never saw blood in her life, not one who never cohabited with a man. Actually, there are three types of virgins: virgin woman, virgin soil, and virgin sycamore tree – and the precise definitions are important for marriage contracts and contracts of sale, but our virgin is of the fourth type. Since Rabbi Meir said that “Any woman whose bloods are abundant, her children are abundant,” - it is the absence of this type of virginity that is desirable to the prospective husband.
<br />
<br />
A pregnant woman has this status when her pregnancy is noticeable. A nursing woman is one who nurses, until she weans the child – these are the words of Rabbi Meir, who says that there is a direct connection between nursing and the abeyance of blood – and therefore it may last even for four or five years. However, the Sages say the the abeyance of blood is the result of having given birth, and lasts no longer than two years.
<br />
<br />
An old woman is one whom they call “Mother so-and-so,” and in today's terminology probably “Granny,” and she is not embarrassed. Others say, until she does not resent it any longer. The difference between these two opinions is the time period when she does not resent it, because it's true, but is still embarrassed. The “old woman” of our ruling is one who is old as above, and then misses her three periods.

Pesachim 10 – Rava, mouse, bread and weasel

Therefore, it must be another bread, and one needs to search the house again to find the piece that the mouse may have hidden. Were it a child, we could assume that he just crumbled the bread and left it there – and no new search would be needed.
<br />
<br />
Then Rava asked his questions. If one sees a mouse with a piece of bread in its mouth enter his house, and then he sees a mouse with a piece of bread exit, can he assume that it is the same mouse and the same bread and therefore he need not search the house? Let’s assume it is the same mouse.
<br />
<br />
Next question: a white mouse with bread enters his house, and then a black one exits –is it for sure a different piece of bread, or perhaps the black mouse snatched it away from the white one? Let’s assume mice don’t snatch bread from each other.
<br />
<br />
Next question: a mouse with bread enters the house, and then a weasel with bread exits the house. If you tell me that the weasel took the bread from the mouse, I will answer that I would expect the mouse, not the bread, to be in the weasel’s mouth.
<br />
<br />
Next question: a mouse with bread enters the house, and then a weasel exits, and in its mouth, there is a mouse and a piece of bread. If you tell me that this is for sure the same bread, I will counter and tell you that the bread should be in the mouse’s mouth, and the mouse should be in the weasel’s mouth. To which you can still answer that perhaps the mouse got scared of the weasel and dropped the bread, and then the weasel picked up both. To this last question, the Talmud does not find a definitive answer.

Complicated as this discussion is, it is actually the accepted law, and one says a new blessing.</p><p>However, there is an exception to this ruling as well: it depends on what food they eat and what blessing follows.

Other blessings are recited together with Havdalah, and there are also many opinions on their order. The opinion of Rava prevails here, and it is abbreviated as YKNH"Z, which stands for blessings on the wine, Kiddush, light (which was not lit on Shabbat), Havdalah, and <i>Shehecheyanu,</i>&nbsp;"Who allowed us to live to this season."<div><br /></div><div>Three people were drinking wine at a meal: Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi. They differed in saying blessings over wine, but each one explained his behavior. Ameimar&nbsp;said a blessing in each cup. He would decide to stop drinking after each cup but would every time change his mind. So, a new blessing was in order. Mar Zutra said the blessing on the first cup and on the last cup, which would come after the Grace after Meal. The new wine that came after the Grace, according to Mar Zutra, required a new blessing. Rav Ashi only said the blessing on the first cup. All wine after that was a continuation of drinking.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: The Drinkers by Vincent van Gogh</div>

Pesachim 108 – Drinking wine and eating matzah

To prepare for this, Rabbah would drink wine all day. Rava, his student, explained: “How do we know that wine makes one hungry? - There is a rule that one can drink more between the first two cups of wine, should he so desire. If wine makes one satiated, this should not have been allowed, for he would not eat matzah with appetite. It must be that wine makes one hungry.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef, on the other hand, would fast before the Seder. Why was he doing this? Could it be that he combined two opinions: that one should not eat or drink before the afternoon prayer (Minchah), which is pushed back even earlier because of the Passover sacrifice? This would be a surprising opinion! – Rather, Rav Yosef was a very delicate man, and had he eaten anything that day, he would not have enjoyed matzah to the fullest.
<br />
<br />
Reclining while eating was considered a sign of a free person, while slaves ate in a hurry, barely sitting down. Therefore, to signify that we are becoming free on that day, all Seder participants must recline while eating matzah and drinking wine. Some say that they must recline while drinking the first two cups because then the beginning of freedom is discussed. In contrast, others claim that they must recline during the last two cups when reading in the Haggadah about real freedom, whereas freedom was just a promise at Exodus's beginning. To satisfy both opinions, people recline while drinking all four cups.
<br />
<br />
The wine, even if diluted, should have the taste and appearance of wine. One could even drink all four cups at once, though he would not have fulfilled the mitzvah with all its details.

Pesachim 109 – More wine

However, not everybody enjoys wine. It is also important for everyone to be joyful on a Holiday, and therefore man gladden their hearts with wine, women – with new dresses, and children are given roasted nuts and sweets. The nosh serves to keep the children awake at the Seder since “tell you son and daughter” is an important part of the Seder.  As an illustration, Rabbi Akiva never liked to say, “Let’s all stand up and leave the study hall,” except for two occasions: on the eve of Passover when one needs to make the kids have an afternoon nap, to stay awake at the Seder, and before Yom Kippur – since it is a mitzvah to eat then.
<br />
<br />
Measures (size of the wine cup, amount of matzah, amount of vegetables, etc.) play an important role in the Seder and other areas. There are two ways to specify them: one based on geometry (such as the volume of a mikvah measured as three cubic “ama” - elbow), and another based on volume (egg volume, olive volume, etc.) One would expect these two ways to agree, but in the eighteenth century, Rabbi Yechezkel Landau measured egg volumes and found a discrepancy by the factor of two. Either the people or the eggs must have changed, which leaves us with two estimates for each given measure.<br />

Pesachim 11 – When one missed his search for chametz

Rabbi Yehudah says that he can search in the morning of the next day, and even later, until midday, up until the time when chametz becomes prohibited. However, the Sages allow one search in the morning, and in the appointed time, and even after that. Why does Rabbi Yehudah stop the search after the chametz becomes forbidden? – Because he is concerned that people may accidentally put it in their mouths. And the Sages? – They say that since one is looking for chametz to destroy it, he will surely not eat it.
<br />
<br />
What is the “appointed time?” above. Rashi says that this is the time appointed for search, before Pesach. But the Tosafot say that this is the time of the Pesach celebration itself. Thus we have very divergent opinions, with Tosafot requiring to search for chametz all the way through Passover and even after that! What causes such a big disagreement? Rashi considered the purpose of the search to stop people from owning chametz on Passover; after Passover has started, chametz is legally not theirs anyway. But Tosafot say that the purpose of the search is so that people would not eat prohibited chametz, and chametz even after Passover can be prohibited if a Jew owned it.

Pesachim 110 – Bad even numbers
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbnEbTsKVh9vx4wE1jr1Oyy_hlKLOHF-gcmdEKrRnXva5kJd1nQfE9rDThpMv7n19RuAkruijamFVeysYQ8E0XdnaCGk5MnaaYQLBSb2IkqV6K-xDdpNsq5qgnQ9b3j0hBUvQqKLsQRb65/s1600/Demon+sitting+by+Mikhail+Aleksandrovich+Vrubel.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="174" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbnEbTsKVh9vx4wE1jr1Oyy_hlKLOHF-gcmdEKrRnXva5kJd1nQfE9rDThpMv7n19RuAkruijamFVeysYQ8E0XdnaCGk5MnaaYQLBSb2IkqV6K-xDdpNsq5qgnQ9b3j0hBUvQqKLsQRb65/s320/Demon+sitting+by+Mikhail+Aleksandrovich+Vrubel.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
Consuming food portions in even numbers opens one to the demons' pranks and to the witchcraft of the humans. Some say that this is patently untrue, some – that duality negates the oneness of God, and thus by avoiding it, we can quietly affirm our beliefs, and yet others  - that good and evil forces do exist in the world.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud asks, how could the Sages establish a Seder with four obligatory cups of wine to be drunk? Two of the answers are that the night of the Seder is guarded against all evil or that each cup, being a separate mitzvah, does not combine with the others.
<br />
<br />
Rava was so careful with even numbers that he mentally counted the cups he drank by marking the roof's beams in this house. Abaye, after he would drink the first cup, his mother would right away give him two more, one in each hand. One man divorced his wife, and she then married a shop owner. Every day he would come to this shop to drink wine but was very careful to count his cups and never drank an even number. Once, however, he lost count after sixteen and left, having drunk an even number; she performed witchcraft, and he burst.
<br />
<br />
The rule, though, is that only one who is mindful about even numbers and demons can fall under their influence. Another rule is that witchcraft and demons lost their power. Finally, a third rule is that one still must be mindful of it. These three rules seem contradictory, but there may still be a resolution.

Pesachim 111 – Knowledge against demons

Their favorite living places are in the trees (especially palm trees) and in the shadows. Thus, knowing how to discern and avoid such places helps. If one finds himself in these places or in dangerous situations, the Talmud gives phrases from the scriptures to recite and counteract the negative influence.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it is good to know the names or qualities of specific demons to write protective amulets. Here is a story to illustrate. A sorb tree may be inhabited by no less than sixty demons of the “shedei” variety. Once a watchman stood by such tree, the demons entered his body, and he was in danger. A certain Sage who did not know about sorb tree wrote an amulet that mentioned only one demon. He heard demons dance inside the tree, singing, “Although this young Torah scholar wears a turban, he does not even know how to say a blessing over it” (incidentally, the blessing is “… who adorns Israel with beauty.”). They meant that he is not worthy of his garment. Another Sage overheard this and wrote an amulet for sixty demons. Afterward, he heard them saying, “Remove your belongings from here!”
<br />
<br />
More advice: putting one’s hand on one’s lip leads to anxiety and putting it on the forehead – to sleep. Some explain that doing actions that are outward signs of such moods actually brings him to these moods.

One should not drink water in the dark from ponds at night because the demon by the name of Shavrirei may be found in this water.  What if one is thirsty? – If he has someone with him, he should say to his friend, “I, the son of so-and-so, am thirsty.” If he has no one with him, he should say, “I, am the son of so-and-so (talking about himself), and my mother said to me, 'Beware of shavrirei, shavrirei, vrirei, rirei, irei, rei,' and I am thirsty for water in new earthenware cups.”
<br />
<br />
Going back to the Seder, even a poor person supported from the communal kitchen is obligated to drink four cups of wine. But this is obvious since every Jew has to do mitzvot!? – True, but this is only needed because of Rabbi Akiva's teaching that one should make his Shabbat like a weekday, but never depend on other people – even according to his opinion, one should beg, borrow, or be provided. 
<br />
<br />
Actually, Rabbi Akiva gave his son seven instructions, the one above and six more, some of which are “don't live in the city where a  Sage is a mayor (because he will be engrossed in study and neglect the city),” “never enter even your own house suddenly, without giving an audible warning” and “engage in business with one who is enjoying good fortune (because his good luck may rub off on you).” The latter, however, is true only for partnership, but not to buy and sell from him – for he will get a better deal. 
<br />
<br />
Later, Rabbi Chanina met with the queen of demons, Agrat bat Machlat, and banned her from appearing to people. She asked for some reprieve, and he gave her Tuesdays and Fridays, but then Abaye banished demons altogether. The Talmud interjects, “But we do see them sometimes!” - and answers that these are stragglers.

These often come in lists. Here are some examples.
<br />
<br />
There are three categories of people about whom God declares His good opinion every day: a bachelor who lives in a metropolis and does not sin; a poor man who finds a lost item and returns it to its owner; a wealthy man who gives charity in private. Rav Safra was a bachelor who lived in a metropolis. When he heard this statement, his face lit up. Rava told him, “Not like you, who anyway spends days and night in the study hall, but someone like Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Oshaya.” They were cobblers in the Land of Israel and worked in a marketplace of harlots, making shoes. When the harlots would come, they would look at these Rabbis, but the Rabbis never raised their eyes at them (some version read, “The Rabbis would put shoes on the harlots’ feet.”) Whenever the harlots needed to swear, their oath was “I swear by the lives of the holy Rabbis who are in the Land of Israel.”
<br />
<br />
There are three whom God loves: one who does not get angry, one who does not get drunk, and one who is forgiving, does not insist on his rights, and does not keep the grudge.  
<br />
<br />
There are three whom God hates: one who says one thing but has another in his heart; one who knows a testimony that could help his friend but does not testify; and one who sees a fellow commit an immoral act and, being the only witness, still testifies against him. The latter is because one witness cannot establish a fact, so he becomes just a talebearer and does it for his own purpose.

The first cup of wine at the Seder is for Kiddush. First, he blesses the day and then the wine, since the day (Passover) is the whole reason for the Kiddush – these are the words of Beit Shammai. However, Beit Hillel school says that he blesses the wine first and then the day – since, without the wine, Kiddush cannot be said at all.
<br />
<br />
Then they bring out a small piece of vegetable, in our case, of lettuce. Even though the same lettuce will later serve him as “bitter herbs,” now he eats it just as an appetizer and to surprise his young children. Then they bring matzah, bitter herbs, and two cooked dishes. The two dishes serve to remind that in the Temple times, there were two sacrifices: the Passover lamb and the “chagigah,” the festival offering.

Should he put them all together and eat as a sandwich? Hillel said that yes, indeed, this is what should be done, since the Torah said, “matzah with maror you shall eat.” However, the Sages disagree and say that the actual commandment is “yochluhu” – meaning, “you shall eat them.” The extra word “them” tells us to eat them separately. In fact, one should not combine them at all, so that the taste of one does not nullify the taste of the other.
<br />
<br />
Who wins? That is a disagreement, and the law is not stated like either one of them. Because of this, one first eats them separately, and then combines them and eats more, this time, together as a sandwich. Only for this second eating, since the law is not clear, one should not say a blessing.

Pesachim 116 – Second cup of wine
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirZvIRugibXMOpt0QHRG7__6Y3TJ2f3isjI4RCpVt1Jfw6N4VGX85a7Z0x9yvMKO0MGLxcNBAWSTCh7s8fATZA_cX3B9xR1-IjdStQ-o2oTRXZ-8UrMW9PiC_TCMd-nDytx5W5761AIhTG/s1600/A+Ride+for+Freedom+-+The+Fugitive+Slaves+by+Eastman+Johnson.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="258" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirZvIRugibXMOpt0QHRG7__6Y3TJ2f3isjI4RCpVt1Jfw6N4VGX85a7Z0x9yvMKO0MGLxcNBAWSTCh7s8fATZA_cX3B9xR1-IjdStQ-o2oTRXZ-8UrMW9PiC_TCMd-nDytx5W5761AIhTG/s320/A+Ride+for+Freedom+-+The+Fugitive+Slaves+by+Eastman+Johnson.jpg" width="320" /></a>After the first cup of wine at the Seder, they immediately pour the second one. Now the curiosity of his son is aroused, and he is supposed to ask, “What is so different about this night that you are drinking a second cup of wine, without having even eaten?” If the son is not observant enough to notice, his wife asks him the same question. And that is the question that he was waiting for, for now, he can plunge into the Haggadah, which providers the answer: “It is because we were slaves once, and now we are free to do as we please and to server our Creator!”
<br />
<br />
Thus, the well-known “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Nishtana">Four Questions of the Seder</a>” are only for those whose curiosity is not naturally aroused in the course of daily life. However, there is also another interpretation, according to which the proper way is to ask the Four Questions exactly as they are spelled out in the Hagaddah.
<br />
<br />
As Rabban Gamliel taught, every person has to imagine that he personally was a slave and then went out of Egypt and became a free man. The Hagaddah should be read with that understanding in mind – and that is why one is supposed to praise and extoll God for all the miracles and say the collection of Psalms known as Hallel (praise).

There are many opinions about who composed those verses and when: David, Moses, the Sages, the Jews at the Red Sea, etc. There are also ten gradations of praise found there, each introduced with a special word. For example, when the psalms start with “By David, a song,” – this means that first God’s presence rested on David, and then he recited the song. On the other hand, when it starts with “A song by David,” – he recited the song, and afterward, the Divine presence rested on him.
<br />
<br />
This tells us an important principle: the Divine presence does not rest on lazy or sad or frivolous, but rather on the one who experiences a serious joy. This is illustrated in Elisha's story, who asked for music, and when a musician played, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b03.htm">God’s hand rested on Elisha</a>.”

He uses the third to enhance the blessing after the meal and the fourth - to finish praises. If he wants to drink more wine - it is OK at the beginning of the meal, but between the third and the fourth cups, he should not drink, lest he becomes inebriated (since he is not eating any longer), and not complete the praises.
<br />
<br />
Multiple lessons are derived from those praises, and they are based on the proximity of the verses to one another. For example, since it says, "Praise the One who gives sustenance to every creature," and immediately after - "One who split the Red Sea," we conclude that man's sustenance is as hard as splitting the Red Sea.

Pesachim 119 – From the psalms

In that, He is not like people. When God wanted to destroy the Jewish people, Moses stopped Him, and God reacted by saying, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a6.htm">had not Moses, <i><b>my chosen one</b></i>, stood in the breach</a>.”<br />
<br />
Various phrases in the psalms were actually said by different people and in different circumstances. King David later combined them together into one whole. For example, <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26b8.htm">here</a>: &nbsp;“I thank You, for You have answered me” was said by King David; “The stones that builders despised has become the cornerstone” was said by David’s father Ishai, and “This emanates from God” was said by David’s brothers.
<br />
<br />
The feast that Abraham made when Isaac was weaned (“gamal”) is indicative of the future feast where the righteous will celebrated the kindness (“gomel”) of God. In the end, they will give Abraham the cup and ask him to recite the blessing over the meal. But he will refuse, saying that Ishmael issued from him. They will ask Isaac, and he will refuse because of Esau. Jacob – because he married two sisters. Moses – because he did not enter Israel. Joshua – because he did not have a son. However, David will accept, saying that it indeed fits for him to bless. Why? Because in the psalms, he said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26b6.htm">I will raise the cup of salvation, and I will invoke the name of God</a>.”<br />

However, the Sages moved this time a little earlier, out of concern that the people won’t be precise with timing.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that it is easy to tell midday by the sun. He, therefore, asks to stop eating chametz an hour before noon and requires all to start burning it in the sixth hour of the day. However, Rabbi Yehudah considers that on a cloudy day one may make a bigger mistake in estimating the time. He, therefore, permits eating chametz for four hours of the day, requires to refrain from eating it in the fifth hour, and to burn it in the sixth.

Pesachim 120 – Dessert

However, there are many ways to understand it. Some say that only one’s favorite meats may not be eaten because they would overpower the Passover sacrifice's taste. Others, however, cite a different reason for the prohibition: one should not eat the sacrifice in two places, and if he were allowed desserts, then eventually he would come to eat them in a different place, and then perhaps even go to a different room with the Passover meat too.
<br />
<br />
Today there is no Passover offering, and eating matzah takes its place. Can one eat a dessert after that? Some say that since the taste of the matzah is weak, any dessert will overpower it, so any dessert is prohibited. Others, however, read the above rule differently: “No dessert is served after the Passover offering” – only after the offering can you not serve dessert, but after the matzah, you can.
<br />
<br />
If some of the members of the Seder fell asleep and then woke up, they can proceed; however, if all of them fell asleep, then on waking they cannot eat the Passover any longer, because it looks like eating in two different places, which, as we said above, is forbidden. If they merely dozed off, they can proceed. What is meant by dozing? – Not quite asleep but not quite awake; if they call him, he responds but cannot command a thoughtful answer; however, if they remind him and ask for a yes or no, he can reply.

Pesachim 121 – Two blessings

To fulfill this, there was another sacrifice at the Passover meal, called “holiday offering.” One ate this first and only then proceeded to the Passover lamb. 
<br />
<br />
Before eating each of these sacrifices, one would have to say the blessing appropriate to it, such as “… Who has sanctified us and commanded to eat a holiday offering.” However, if one said the blessing on the Passover lamb, that already includes both blessings – these are the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva argues and says that not one of these two blessings includes the other. The essence of the disagreement goes back to the way these offerings were brought in the Temple. One required “throwing the blood,” while the other – just “putting the blood on the Altar.” According to Rabbi Ishmael, pouring includes such actions as throwing, and accordingly, one blessing covers both, but according to Rabbi Akiva, these are independent actions.
<br />
<br />
Still, on the subject of two blessings, the Talmud asks about the redemption of a firstborn. Here there are two blessings, “commanded us to redeem the firstborn sons” (by giving money to a Kohen) and “allowed us to live to this time.” Rabbi Simai attended the first-born feast, and they asked him who says these blessings. Perhaps the Kohen, who gets the money, says “allowed us to live to this time?” Rabbi Simai did not know and went to ask in the study hall. They told him, “The father of the son who is being redeemed – he says both blessings.”

Pesachim 13 – Chametz sign for the people

For example, if Passover falls out on Sunday, so that one won’t be able to burn it on a day before, which is Shabbat – what is one to do with the Kohen’s portion of the bread in his possession? In this case, Rabbi Yehoshua allows him to burn it on Friday, but the Sages still require him to wait – perhaps a Kohen will chance to his house on Saturday.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua counters that if no Kohen was in town on Friday then he won’t come on Saturday – because one cannot travel on Shabbat, but the Sages say that a Kohen might be on the road close by. “If you are so careful,” – said Rabbi Yehoshua – “then why did you allow burning Kohen’s portion which may have become impure? Perhaps Elijah the Prophet will come and reveal that this bread is pure?” To which the Sages replied that it is well known that Elijah will not come on Friday when the Jews are busy preparing for Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
In the Temple, there was a sign for the people: two unused loaves of bread were lying on the roof while chametz could be eaten; one was removed when they had to refrain from eating, and the last was taken away when the time to burn chametz arrived.

<br />
<br />
What follows for the next seven pages is a discussion of this rule's ramifications, and this chapter is considered one of the hardest in the Talmud.
<br />
<br />
The subjects that will be discussed include sources of ritual impurity (humans and animals), degrees of impurity (there are five of them), objects that can become impure (humans but not animals, also vessels, clothing, food, and beverages), purification from impurity (mikveh), and consequences of impurity (none today, all were important only in the times of the Temple).

Even though normally one is forbidden to make foods impure, it is permissible to do so for the last few moments before it is finally destroyed. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva later added to this testimony, and Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua disagreed on a related topic. Rabbi Meir makes this relevant to Passover by stating, “from their words we can learn that on Passover when one is destroying chametz, he can burn the Kohen’s portion of the food, the pure and impure together.”
<br />
<br />
The problem is that Rabbi Meir did not specify whose words he had in mind. The Talmud considers what exactly did Rabbi Akiva add, and whose words did Rabbi Meir learn from. It is possible to understand the words of Rabbi Meir in many ways. Examples of such understanding will be given on the following pages.

Pesachim 16 – What did Rabbi Akiva add?

Both state that one can add to the already existing impurity when the food is anyway being destroyed? And actually, what new did Rabbi Chanina say in the first place? Food can not make other food impure anyway!?
<br />
<br />
In order to answer this, the Talmud has to introduce two new concepts. True, by Torah law one food cannot convey impurity to another. However, the Sages, out of love for the purity of holy foods, added a law that food can (as if were, by this new decree) convey impurity to another food. We thus see what Rabbi Chanina is teaching us.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva seems to be adding nothing: if you count the degrees of impurity in his example, they are the same as in Rabbi Chanina’s. We are forced to say that the lamp that Rabbi Akiva is talking about was made of metal. Metal has the law of impurity different from other materials: it acquires the same level of impurity as the person who touches it, not the usual one-degree lower. Thus, Rabbi Akiva is teaching us that the oil was acquiring two degrees of impurity in the process and that this nevertheless was permitted.

Pesachim 17 – The impurity of liquids
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7WF-gO5P3rEk3v6tsLMzboBpIP2n920qtZbFrUAFbNkXV_Ki0CefVLGVs4e3EDRby_309FJJlO0hSAfx1yFjNXCXiDT_NvmJUwuYT1TibMrNKeNip-UaXKOqD5JQyMtsBrWncznxD530l/s1600/Washing+Day+By+Edward+Stott.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7WF-gO5P3rEk3v6tsLMzboBpIP2n920qtZbFrUAFbNkXV_Ki0CefVLGVs4e3EDRby_309FJJlO0hSAfx1yFjNXCXiDT_NvmJUwuYT1TibMrNKeNip-UaXKOqD5JQyMtsBrWncznxD530l/s320/Washing+Day+By+Edward+Stott.jpg" width="296" /></a>The Torah describes the ritual impurity of foods. It also says that foods can become impure only after they were made wet with a liquid. This leaves us with a question: can liquids themselves become impure?
<br />
<br />
We can start with one fact that is certain: Rabbi Yosef ben Yoezer testified that the liquids in the Temple are pure. However, there are different ways to understand his words. For example, Rav understood them literally: these liquids are completely pure; Shmuel, by contrast, said that they are pure only in the sense that they don’t transmit impurity to other things, but they themselves can become ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
Rav explains that the Torah laws of impurity do not apply to liquids. The Sages extended them to liquids for people to be more careful, but stopped short of making the liquids in the Temple impure because the Kohanim are careful anyway. Shmuel explains that on the contrary, the Torah laws of impurity do apply to liquids – but only to themselves, not to transmit impurity to others. The Sages extended the laws of impurity further, giving liquids the power to contaminate other foods, but stopped from accepting these laws in the Temple.
<br />
<br />
There are different versions of the testimony of Rabbi Yosef: some say it applied to the place of washing the sacrifices only, while others – that he meant anywhere in the Temple. Rav Pappa complicated this even further, saying that the laws of liquids in the Temple were told by God to Moses as an exception, and thus no conclusions can be drawn from them to other areas of life.

Pesachim 18 – Who contaminates whom

On this, there are three opinions.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that the power of liquids to make other objects impure is only decreed by the Sages, and they never went as far as to forbid things out of doubt. Therefore, the object is pure. Rabbi Yehudah says that it is the Torah who gave the liquid the power to transmit impurity and therefore, to avoid any doubt in this, we must consider the objects impure. Finally, Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon divide this even further. If it was food that was possibly touched by the liquid, then – since this situation is given by the Torah – we must consider food impure. However, if it is a vessel, then – since this impurity would be only decreed by the Sages – we must consider the vessel pure.
<br />
<br />
They derive their opinions from the word “yitma” used by the Torah, which means “It will become impure.” Since this word can also be read “yitama”, which would mean that it will make another object impure, here we begin to consider exactly which other objects will become impure.
<br />

In discussing this, Rabbi Yochanan mentions that even non-edible parts of sacrifices, such as spices and woodblock, can become ritually impure. Moreover, if they are placed in a vessel, the vessel combines them, so that if a ritually impure person touches one component, they all become impure.  However, Rav Chanin objects and says that it was not the Sages who decreed it, but the Torah: when it mentioned a sacrifice of “one cup,” Rav Chanin interprets this to mean “cup makes all one.”
<br />
<br />
Also on a tangent, the Talmud discusses a needle that was found in sacrificial meat, with the result that the meat is impure, but the hands and the knife are pure. How could that be? Why would we presume that the needle is impure? – We are forced to say that it touched a dead person, and was now recognized by someone. Then the knife should also be impure! In truth, it is not, because they only suspect that this is the same needle, and all suspicion of this sort are disregarded in a public area – which the Temple Courtyard surely is.

When? – When it becomes “light” of the fourteenth, “ore” in Hebrew.
<br />
<br />
What does the teacher mean by the word “ore?” Rav Huna said that it means literally light, and Rav Yehudah said that it means night. Initially, the Talmud understands that Rav Huna means it to be really in the morning, and one should search for chametz then. Why would one use a candle in the morning? – it’s the early hours, and a candle can help. By contrast, Rav Yehudah really means searching at night, as soon as it becomes dark. 
<br />
<br />
Can we clarify the meaning of the word “ore” or “light?” For example, in the phrase “And God called the light (“ore”) day,” it seems very clear that “ore” is the day. However, you can read it differently: God called to the light and told the light to serve the day's needs, but these are not the same. 
<br />
<br />
In the end, the Talmud cannot conclusively prove from the Torah alone that “light” and “day” are the same. However, the way God explained the rules to Moses, chametz is indeed searched for at night. It's just that some people call night “night,” while others call night “light,” as a euphemism, or refined speech, trying to avoid any connotation of darkness.

<br />
<br />
But why should the meat ever become impure? Any food, to become impure, must first become wet with water. While the animal is alive, it cannot become impure, and they have just slaughtered it!? It cannot be any liquid in the Temple, because <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/07/pesachim-17-impurity-of-liquids.html">these are all pure</a>. Nor can it be the impurity declared out of love for holy things, because such impurity was only declared on object themselves, not giving them the power to transmit impurity further. Rav Yehudah gave the answer: the owner led the cow through a river on the way to the Temple, to wash it off, and this water was still dripping. Since the owner wanted this water to be on a cow, all preconditions for impurity are fulfilled.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud suggests and refutes a hypothesis about impurity. If a dead reptile is found in an earthenware utensil, it makes the utensil impure. Can we view the utensil as being full of impurity, contaminating any food that is inside? – No, we cannot. The Torah said, “anything inside,” which tells us that foods are impure by virtue of being inside. Thus, we have to say that the reptile touches the air, and the air touches the food, resulting in the transmission of impurity.

Here is the exact rule.
<br />
<br />
As long as it is permitted to eat chametz, one may feed it to domestic animals, beasts in the field, and birds, sell it to a non-Jew, and generally benefit from it. Once the time has passed, all benefit from chametz is forbidden, even lighting up a fire to warm oneself or burning it in an oven to cook.
<br />
<br />
That, however, does not look right. According to Rabbi Yehudah, there is the fifth hour when one cannot eat chametz but can still benefit from it, and according to our rule here, there is no such time. According to Rabbi Meir, it should say “as long as he eats,” for otherwise “permitted” talks to one group of people, and “one may feed” to another!?
<br />
<br />
Indeed, this ruling belongs to neither one of them, but to Rabban Gamliel instead, who permits the Kohanim to eat their portion in the fifth hour. Why does the rule mention all animals separately? Because the wild animal hides the chametz, and because with a domestic animal he may forget to remove the leftovers. And why the birds? – After we mentioned both classes of animals, it would not be right to omit the birds either.

Where does it say so in the Torah? – The words “It will not be eaten” are understood to mean, “You shall not do anything with it that can lead to eating.”
<br />
<br />
That, actually, is a general rule. Any time something “will not be eaten,” it is really prohibited for all use – these are the words of Chizkiyah. Rabbi Abahu says that the rule is even more general: anything about which the Torah says, “do not eat it,” is additionally prohibited for all benefit.
<br />
<br />
Where does Rav Abahu get his additional stringency? – From the rule about meat not slaughtered properly. Since such meat can be either “given as a present to a non-Jewish resident in Israel or sold to a non-Jew,” we understand that in all other cases, “do not eat” means “and don’t use or sell.”
<br />
<br />
The Talmud offers many challenges to both Chizkiyah and Rabbi Abahu. For example, the sciatic nerve (think filet mignon) cannot be eaten, but it can be sold to a non-Jewish butcher. Why is the benefit permitted in this case? – They will answer that it is an exception since this nerve was permitted for benefit together with the meat that was not slaughtered properly. Other cases intended to disprove them similarly end up being exceptions and special cases.

The Talmud keeps asking questions about this rule. Take, for example, the Kohen’s portion: a non-priest should not eat it, but one can use it for his eruv. Rabbi Abahu says that it is an exception: the Torah said, “This will be the priest’s portion for you,” which means that it is “for you,” you can use it, though not eat it. 
<br />
<br />
Then what about wine for a Nazirite? He cannot drink it, but we can make an <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/03/eruvin-2-houses-courtyard-alley.html">eruv</a> of wine for him?! Again, this is an exception: the Torah said, “All the days of his vow, wine is forbidden” – the word “his” tells us that it is his, though forbidden for drinking.
<br />
<br />
What about the small non-kosher animals such as rats or rabbits: one cannot eat them, but if he catches them in a net accidentally, he can sell them?! – Again, exception: the Torah said, “They will be an unpleasant thing for you,” and this “for you” teaches that they will be yours, only prohibited for eating.
<br />
<br />
After a few more such examples we cannot find where the rule of “don’t eat, don’t use” is ever applicable, and what is the difference between “don’t eat” of Rabbi Abahu and “won’t be eaten” of Chizkiyah. We finally find only one such case: an animal that was brought into the Temple and slaughtered there, even though it was not a sacrifice – and the difference is whether this meat can be sold or not.

He said, “How do we know that chametz is forbidden for all benefit on Pesach?” 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shmuel exclaimed in amazement, “We know that from ‘do not eat’ prohibition. Why do we need anything else?” The student then showed him how according to other views of Rabbi Yehoshua this derivation would not work. Rabbi Shmuel was convinced, and the student continued, “From ‘all invalid sin offerings you should burn in a fire.’” Now, this command is not needed, because the offering in question was already burned in a fire. Here we see a new fundamental rule: if there is a commandment, which seems unneeded and repetitive, one can apply it to another area of law. For example, if we don’t need to know that a sin offering should be burned, we can apply it to chametz on Passover and require it to be burned rather than used for benefit.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then finds yet another, different way to derive that any use of chametz is prohibited on Passover.

What would be an example? – If he takes that fat that is to be burned on the Altar and swallows it raw instead. A stricter version of this teaching prohibits even that and allows only an unusual manner of benefiting, such as putting this fat on a wound with medicinal purposes. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yakov said that three things one should not do, and the first one is healing himself with idolatry. But his life may be in danger!? – Yes, that is what he meant, even if life is in danger. Why? Because the Torah said, “You shall love your God with your soul and with your possessions.” This is talking about two kinds of people, for some their money is more important than life, and for others, their life is more important, and even so, there are situations where one must give up his life.
<br />
<br />
The second thing is having illicit relations, even if his health is in danger without them, and even if he is facing an ultimatum to do it. The third is killing someone. The latter is derived by logic: how do you know that your blood is redder than his, that you are willing to kill him in order to save your life?

Pesachim 26 – Incidental pleasures
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1j9N90rQ1OtNQtAnsHS-jP0XJxU4XsnctGUnnVJwiXhmiv8PQf95Edct0lMJFY2dcnZz8aBsbgdqt_fXjYMaMLGnUXhWwuXy49wMVTLY52zOOkuIIpgilofSUYyH8sGX-D7048ZJ0ryAW/s1600/The+Spice+Shop+by+Paolo+Antonio+Barbieri.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="222" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1j9N90rQ1OtNQtAnsHS-jP0XJxU4XsnctGUnnVJwiXhmiv8PQf95Edct0lMJFY2dcnZz8aBsbgdqt_fXjYMaMLGnUXhWwuXy49wMVTLY52zOOkuIIpgilofSUYyH8sGX-D7048ZJ0ryAW/s320/The+Spice+Shop+by+Paolo+Antonio+Barbieri.jpg" width="320" /></a>Consider a case where one is planning to do something permitted, but an additional forbidden pleasure comes his way in the course of it. For example, he plans to travel to a certain destination, but on his way, there is an idolatrous temple, from which there comes a fragrant smell of idolatrous spices. (Of course, we are not talking about a case where he intentionally inhales to enjoy the smell, but rather he is just passing by, and it fills his nostrils anyway). Should one avoid this nevertheless? Abaye says it is permitted, and he need not avoid it, but Rava says that it is prohibited, and one must avoid it.
<br />
<br />
Let’s take a closer look at the circumstances. If he can avoid the trip altogether, while he enjoys the smell, all agree that it is forbidden. Even if he cannot avoid the trip but still enjoys the spices, it is still forbidden. On the other hand, if he must travel on this road and does not intend to enjoy it, all agree that it is permitted. They only argue when he cannot avoid the trip and does enjoy the smell: according to Abaye, it is permitted, but Rava will require him to either avoid the trip or stop enjoying the smell.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud compares this to laws of Shabbat, of Temple repair, of the priests’ vestments, and of a red heifer, and finally refutes at least one version of Rava’s view from the sales of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatnez">shatnez</a>, as this. The sellers of shatnez are allowed to put the clothes on, as long as they don’t intend to warm themselves with them.

Pesachim 27 – Not even lit the fire

What if he did? We cannot, of course, require that he cool himself off. However, a related question may be asked.
<br />
<br />
What if he took forbidden wood (such as the peels of Orlah fruit, which has grown on a tree in the first three years of its life and is forbidden for use, or wheat stalks that have grown in a vineyard and are equally forbidden) and fired an oven with that? – Here the law is known. If the oven was new, now it has to be shattered, since the first firing improves it. If the oven was old, he only needs to wait till it cools off, to remove the forbidden benefit.
<br />
<br />
What about bread baked in such an oven? Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that the bread is forbidden – because the improvement in the bread was created by forbidden wood. But the Sages allow such bread. What could be their reason? – They say that the heat affects the bread after the wood has been burned, and thus it is not a direct result of the forbidden wood.

Pesachim 28 – Some say, chametz is allowed
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5DBssHCzkxJxvO7S_lhzI6jcvbTj87vCQre3i_ISsp53VA1YfBKkIoBw2GJJdpgVTkcBEhpm1CAODCh16ewQ4O2deotztLlofzQm_qv2Pjw3bCTCpKG8fd8BERh_90Ki6zfg_f2q6dcYB/s1600/Forbidden+Fruit+by+James+Jebusa+Shannon.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5DBssHCzkxJxvO7S_lhzI6jcvbTj87vCQre3i_ISsp53VA1YfBKkIoBw2GJJdpgVTkcBEhpm1CAODCh16ewQ4O2deotztLlofzQm_qv2Pjw3bCTCpKG8fd8BERh_90Ki6zfg_f2q6dcYB/s320/Forbidden+Fruit+by+James+Jebusa+Shannon.jpg" width="244" /></a>Rabbi Yehudah says that the only way to destroy chametz is by burning it in a fire. The Sages disagree and say to him, “You sound stringent here, but this will lead to a great leniency later on: if one does not have firewood, what is he to do?” Rabbi Yehudah tries to prove his point of view to the Sages by comparing chametz to various offerings that must be burned. Still, he is ultimately disproved by contradictions with his earlier statements. The Talmud then applies to him a proverb, “The arrow maker was killed by his own arrow.”<br />
<br />
The next rule about chametz is that if a non-Jew owned it during Passover, then after Passover, it is permitted for use. Still, if it was a Jew who owned it on Passover, then this chametz is forever forbidden for use because of the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=13#P1875">no leaven must be seen in your territories</a>.” 
<br />
<br />
This rule is strange according to whichever view you take. Rabbi Yose allows the use of chametz on Passover itself! Rabbi Shimon forbids it only during Passover, but not after. And Rabbi Yehudah, who is the strictest, should forbid any chametz that existed on Passover, regardless of who owned it. Thus, we are left with no authority that forbids only the chametz owned on Passover by a Jew.

Pesachim 29 – Eating chametz of the Temple

Now the Talmud says that it could have many sources. It could be the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who, although strict, interprets the law of “not seeing chametz in your dwelling” as telling us that your chametz cannot be seen, but non-Jewish chametz and chametz of the Temple can be seen. It could also be the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: even though the chametz after Passover is not prohibited, it could be that the Sages added a penalty and prohibited it nevertheless.
<br />
<br />
Now that we know that the Temple’s chametz is not “yours” and is less stringent, what if one does eat it after all? Does he have to bring a special sacrifice for using Temple’s property? Some say that yes: since after Passover, it is not prohibited and can be redeemed, he has used the Temple value and has to pay. However, others say that one does not bring this sacrifice: since by eating chametz, he anyway forfeits his soul, he is spared the monetary punishment.

Pesachim 3 – Trying to use clean language

From where does the Talmud derive this idea?<br />
<br />
In describing which animals went into Noah’s Ark, the Torah says, “and of animals that are not pure…” It could have said, “that are impure,” but it wanted to avoid calling them thus, and spent extra eight letters to use a lengthier but pure language.
<br />
<br />
However, in teaching, one must also express himself in the most concise and clear language possible to make it easier for students to remember. What is the conclusion then? As thus: if the two ways, the clean and the not clean, are equal in length, one should use the clean language. But if the clean language is longer, one should use the precise though unpleasant language. Why then did the Torah deviate from the rule and use a longer “animals that are not pure?” - to teach the value of refined speech.<br />
<br />
Once two students were studying with Rav. One said, “this study made us tired as pigs,” and the other – “this study made us tired as young goats,” and Rav never spoke with the first one again.

Pesachim 30 – Chametz mix

Of course, if you can feel its taste, it is the same as chametz itself, but Rav refers even to minute amounts. Why doesn't the regular law of nullification of small amounts apply? This is a special decree: since normally people are accustomed to eating chametz, and since eating it leads to being cut off from one’s spiritual source, then it is better to distance people from even small admixtures of chametz. 
<br />
<br />
However, Shmuel does not see a reason for this additional decree, and according to him, a small admixture of chametz that is not noticeable is, in fact, allowed on Passover. Even Shmuel does not allow nullification if the mixtures are of the same kind, for example, bread mixed with matzah. Finally, Rabbi Yochanan is even more lenient: he allows nullification of even bread with matzah.
<br />
<br />
Correspondingly, they will differ for chametz after Passover: some will consider the mixture with its own kind forever forbidden if owned by a Jew on Passover, while others will allow mixtures after the time of the prohibition has passed. 
<br />
<br />
Rava, who lived after them, stated the decisive law: chametz mixture is forbidden on Passover and permitted afterward.

If after Passover the Jew defaults on the loan, the non-Jew keeps the chametz as a repayment. We can say that the chametz was already in non-Jewish hand on Passover retroactively, and now it is permitted for use.
<br />
<br />
By contrast, imagine a non-Jew who borrowed money and left his chametz in the Jew's house. Now, if after Passover the non-Jew defaults on his loan, the chametz becomes Jewish retroactively and is therefore forbidden for use, as chametz owned by a Jew on Passover.
<br />
<br />
In general, Abaye says that when one defaults on a loan, the lender acquires the collateral retroactively, from the first minute of the loan. Why? Since he did not repay, it is now clear that the collateral belonged to the lender all along. If he did something with it earlier, such as selling it, it now transpires that he had the right to do so.
<br />
<br />Rava will say that since the borrower could have paid the money any time, the collateral always remained his. If the lender sold it before the loan was due, he did so illegally. It seems, though, that the rule we started with presents a problem to Rava! There, the lender did acquire chametz retroactively!? – Rava will answer that there it was different: whiskey was left with the lender who did not need to take any action to acquire it.

However, he still needs to renounce it in his heart – lest it becomes uncovered during Passover and he will want it. How deep does it have to be buried? – So that a dog cannot dig it out. And how deep is that? – Three handbreadths.
<br />
<br />
If one eats the priest’s portion (terumah) on Passover, and it was chametz, then if he did it by mistake, he needs to repay the amount he ate plus one fifth, whereas if he did it on purpose, he needs to repay nothing at all. 
<br />
<br />
This seems counterintuitive! However, let’s look deeper. If he eats terumah (2% of the crop, Kohen’s portion) by mistake, the Torah says that he needs to return the grain itself. The grain becomes terumah again, and he even adds one-fifth to be forgiven for his error.
<br />
<br />
By contrast, if he eats it knowingly, he is treated like a regular thief, who repays only what he has stolen, in cash or other goods. Since chametz on Passover is worth nothing, it turns out that he stole zero value and has to repay zero.

<br />
<br />
The answer is that Rabbi Yochanan considers grape juice as a separate liquid that happens to be contained in grape skin. As such, the skin protects the juice rather than contaminate it. When he squeezes the juice out, given that the amount of grapes is less than an egg’s volume, it cannot transmit impurity further.
<br />
<br />
Still, Rav Chisda was amazed and asked, “The impurity of the grapes, where did it go?” That is because, according to him, the grape juice permeates the grape and becomes one with it, so an impure grape skin makes the juice impure right away, and this impurity cannot disappear.

They told him, “You know for whom it is forbidden? – For all others, but not for the priests, and in fact, it is pure.” Rava rejected the answer since it would not be teaching anything new. They tried another time: “It became impure because the priests did not watch it!” – but that answer was not satisfactory either. 
<br />
<br />
When Ravin went to Israel and related this question to Rav Yirmiyah, the latter said, “Stupid Babylonians! They live in the low dark land, and because of that, their teachings are murky.” (When they don’t know a reason, they just invent it!) The real reason was conclusively proven by Resh Lakish to be this: in truth, this portion of the grain is pure, but the Sages, out of their love for holy things, decreed additional impurity on the planted grain and removed the power of the earth to purify it. Basically, however, it is pure, and thus it cannot transmit impurity further.

Pesachim 35 – What to make matzah from?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXg8zdmRmuBEmry7OOIjXMhW4ypGC9T54a0XmsH9Wdy82h0YaS1sEvvoXdTE7nlbkhPT8u9zNpBju3bAmbM8wnOXsSIfs9bINqTUVhYvqc6HCWG511794Xzui7XgEmNfv3lq4PKjhrFYz9/s1600/St.+Peter+Sleeping,++by+Giuseppe+Antonio+Petrini.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXg8zdmRmuBEmry7OOIjXMhW4ypGC9T54a0XmsH9Wdy82h0YaS1sEvvoXdTE7nlbkhPT8u9zNpBju3bAmbM8wnOXsSIfs9bINqTUVhYvqc6HCWG511794Xzui7XgEmNfv3lq4PKjhrFYz9/s320/St.+Peter+Sleeping,++by+Giuseppe+Antonio+Petrini.jpg" width="320" /></a>One can make matzah only from wheat, barley, spelt, rye, and oats. Why just these? – Because the Torah said, “With the Passover offering, you don’t eat any leaven… for seven days you will eat matzah.” Thus, only things that can become leaven can serve for matzah for the Passover Seder. What is excluded? For example, rice.<br />
<br />
Can you revert this rule and say that only things that can be made into Seder matzah are prohibited as hametz? Not quite, and here is why. Rav Pappa and Rav Huna were sitting in front of Rav Idi, who was dozing off. They said between themselves, “Why does Resh Lakish say that if one makes a dough with fruit juice and it leavens, one still has not violated Passover? – It must be because this matzah is too rich, and one needs to remember affliction and eat matzah of poverty. But, on the other hand, if one dissolves flour in water and it leavens, he is liable, even though it is not fit as matzah for the Seder!?” At this, Rav Idi woke up and said, “Kids! Resh Lakish's reason is different: dough made with fruit juice does not leaven!”
<br />
<br />
One fulfills his obligation to eat matzah even if it was made from flour that has not been fully tithed or has minor defects in the tithing procedure, but not major ones.

Furthermore, this tithe cannot be given to a bereaved, but rather it is reserved for joyful occasions. Can one make matzah out of it? – No, because matzah is called “the bread of affliction” – these are the words of Rabbi Yosi HaGlili. However, Rabbi Akiva disagrees: the Torah has mentioned the word “matzah” many times, to indicate that even the second tithe flour can be used. But matzah is called “bread of affliction!?” – fine, just don’t make it with wine, oil, or honey. Still, “bread of affliction,” “lechem oni” does hint at bereavement? – No, it does not, rather it means “bread of answer” – since over matzah we answer many questions.
<br />
<br />
Fruit and grain that ripens first is called “first fruit” and is brought to Jerusalem and is eaten there by the priests. Can the priests make matzah out of that? – No, since the Torah said, “You will eat matzah in all your dwellings,” that is, matzah must be fit to be eaten everywhere, and the first fruit flour is fit to be eaten only in Jerusalem.

Pesachim 37 – Cookies baked by Baitus

If it means bread one hand-breadth thick like they used to bake in the Temple, without giving it a chance to leaven – then how can Beit Hillel allow it? Obviously, priests in the Temple could be trusted to use dry wood, hot metal ovens, etc., but not the general populace. Rather, this particular rule is just talking about abundant bread, and Beit Shammai forbids it simply because it is too much work for a holiday. If so, it should apply to all holidays! – You are right, it is, just that our teacher was teaching it on Passover, so he used the Passover name.
<br />
<br />
In general, matzah should be baked quickly so that the dough does not get a chance to rise and become chametz. What about special cookie-formed dough for the matzah? A baker named Baitus sought permission to bake such matzot since he was doing it very fast. However, the Sages asked him, “What will the people say? That all cookie-matzot are forbidden, but that of Baitus are allowed?” Certainly, a non-professional baker cannot do it fast enough, and for her, it is forbidden. 
<br />
<br />
Some reverse this logic: a home-based baker does quick, simple cookie-matzot, and for her, it is allowed. However, a baker is going for fancy ones; it takes him more time and is therefore forbidden.

Rav Pappa objected: “Does it ever say, ‘your own’ about matzah?” Rava told him that actually, it does. The same word, “bread,” is used to describe matzah, “bread of affliction,” and challah, the priest's portion, which makes their laws the same.  This has a practical ramification: one cannot fulfill the mitzvah of eating matzah at the Seder with stolen matzah. 
<br />
<br />
The offering of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazirite">Nazirite</a> included unleavened bread. Can one use this bread for his Seder? The answer is that if he prepared it for himself, then he cannot eat it at the Seder, but if he prepared it to sell to others, then he can use it himself. This seems paradoxical. However, it is logical.<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “Watch your matzah,” that is, guard it for the sake of the Seder. If he prepared the matzah for himself, he watched it for a Nazirite, not for the Seder – thus, he cannot eat it. But if he prepared it for others, he had a thought in the back of his mind that if he cannot find buyers, he will use it for the Seder. Therefore, he watched with the intention of possibly using it for Seder, and now he can indeed eat it.

Now that there is no Temple and no Passover offering, strictly speaking, bitter herbs are not required, but the Sages instituted that they should be eaten nevertheless so that this mitzvah will not be forgotten.
<br />
<br />
What kind of bitter herbs should one eat? Any lettuce will do, but people usually use romaine lettuce. Although it is not really bitter, it would become so if let to grow and become old, and that is enough. Although any bitter herb will do, the Talmud enumerates a few specific ones whose names contain hints. For example, “chazeret,” or lettuce is “chasa” in Aramaic because God “chas” – pitied us. Horseradish can also be used, but extreme bitterness is not required, as shown by lettuce. The quality of lettuce being sweet at first and bitter later reminds us how Egyptians treated the Jews: with soft talk first, but harsh actions later.
<br />
<br />
How do we know that more than one type of herb is valid? – Because it is similar to matzah, which also can be made of different types of grain. The bitter vegetable must not be boiled or pickled because this takes away the bitterness.

Even if we are rushing to do a mitzvah, we don’t find anywhere that it should happen the night prior. Since chametz will be prohibited only from the middle of the next day, we could require the search to be done early in the morning.<br />
<br />
Rav Nachman answered that there are two reasons: first, people are usually at home at this time, so albeit a little early, but guaranteed that all will take part. Also, we really want to use a candle, and the night is best for that.
<br />
<br />
If one rents a house around the fourteenth, who is supposed to search the house for chametz, the renter (because it's his house), or the house owner (because it's his chametz)? For the mezuzah, it is the renter’s obligation. However, that is because mezuzah is for the one who lives in the house, not for the house itself. For chametz, this is exactly our question - is it for the person or for the house? Again, Rav Nachman quoted a rule that resolves this: if the renter got the keys before the evening of the fourteenth, it’s his obligation, and if later – it’s the owner's obligation.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud also considers the situation where the renter assumed the house to be checked and found that it wasn’t – can he ask for his money back? (Spoiler: no money back! The person should be happy to do the mitzvah of searching for chametz or even pay someone to do it).<br />

One should not soak bran for chicken, and of course, one should not soak the actual grain. Some say that the bran itself leavens, while others – that the problem is with the small portions of the grains adhering to the bran.
<br />
<br />
A woman should not soak bran to use it as a cleaning agent when going to the baths. She may, however,  rub it on the dry skin. Similarly, one should not chew grains of wheat and place them on his wound for a cure – because this creates chametz.
<br />
<br />
If so, how is one to behave? Here are the rules that tell us when leavening can no longer occur: If one baked, cooked, or scalded grain in hot water, then this is completely safe on Passover. 
<br />
<br />
Can one add flour to a pot that's cooking already? Some say that one must then immediately add vinegar, which stops the leavening process, but some completely allow this. (Today, a moot question; many later customs made it much more strict.)<br />

Still, if he did put flour in them – he needs to eat it right away. That is because vinegar slows down leavening, so if he eats it before it leavens, he is safe.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Meir says that it must be burned immediately. Some say this is because Rabbi Meir considers vinegar as helping to leaven, not slowing it down. Others, however, say that Rabbi Meir agrees about vinegar slowing down leavening, but he is afraid that if you allow eating the mixture, then people may be negligent and not eat it soon enough. 
<br />
<br />
As a preface to laws of cooking the Passover lamb in a subsequent chapter,&nbsp; the Talmud gives a few rules here. One should not cook it in water or in any other liquid, but only roast it on fire. However, once it is roasted, he can baste it or eat it with relishes. 
<br />
<br />
Water used by a baker to wish her hands contains flour. Such water should be poured out onto a sloping surface, for otherwise, this water itself may leaven.

Rav Nachman explained: originally, wine from Judea would not sour, due to the merit of its being used in the Temple, and to convert it to vinegar, one had to add barley. The standard vinegar of that time was the one made from Judean wine. However, now it is the wine of Edom (Roman empire and its successors) that does not sour, so they have to add barley to it, and it is called “Idumean vinegar.”

However, according to Rabbi Eliezer, they might still be permitted to eat chametz on Pesach. Why? Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=16#P5340">Do not eat any leaven, seven days eat matzah</a>.” Now we know that women are free from any Torah commandment that has a fixed time for doing it due to their busy schedules. This would include eating matzah since it is applicable only on the seven days of Passover. And once they don't have to eat matzah, the “do not eat leaven” should not apply to them either. 
<br />
<br />
A third source comes to reconcile these contradictory indications. There is an extra word “anything” in verse, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1837">You must not eat anything leavened</a>.” This extra word shifts the balance and is used by Rabbi Eliezer to obligate women to abstain from chametz. And once this is achieved, the connection between not eating chametz and eating matzah at the Seder is restored, and women become obligated to eat matzah. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Eliezer could have used the word “anything” for a different law and derive from it that other foods mixed with chametz are equally forbidden. Why didn't he? – It is reasonable to say that in the context of “eaters,” we add another group of “eaters,” that is, women, not another group of what is being eaten, that is, mixtures.

<br />
<br />
Take, for example, the&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/08/pesachim-42-unwanted-substances.html">Babylonian sour dip</a> we discussed above, which was not prohibited by the Torah and was only removed as a precaution? Rav Dimi answered, “Forget Babylonian sour dip, where the concentration of bread is not sufficient to reach an olive's bulk in normal eating.” 
<br />
<br />
This dip is meant to be eaten as a condiment. <span>&nbsp; &nbsp; When</span>&nbsp;one eats it, he does not reach the olive's bulk of bread in the normal eating period, and he is not liable from the Torah point of view. On the other hand, if he decides to gulp the dip, he is not eating like people normally eat. This is not considered an act of eating either – and Torah only prohibits eating chametz by swallowing it normally.
<br />
<br />
Abaye asked more questions, comparing this to the laws of a Nazirite who decides to soak his bread in wine, to meat cooked in milk, and to milk in which meat was cooked, but Rav Dimi was able to answer all of them, so in the end, one cannot mix bread into his food and eat it on Passover.

Pesachim 45 – Dough in the cracks of a kneading trough

If the amount of this dough is more than an olive volume, one must dispose of it for Passover. However, if it is less than an olive, then it is considered nullified due to its small size, and one can keep it there.<br />
<br />
There are qualifications to this rule, though: it is only applicable to the trough's upper part, which does not hold water. The bottom part of the trough, where kneading takes place and where water enters, needs to be strong, so there even larger dough pieces are used to strengthen the trough, and therefore they don’t have to be removed.<br />
<br />
The same rule applies to ritual impurity: if one cares that the dough is there, it stops impurity. However, this statement is not easy to understand: if anything, it is not the same. Before, all depended on the dough piece's size, and now it depends on one caring about the dough being there. The Talmud tries to give it a few interpretations and ends up understanding it as thus. If the dough is important in his eyes, such as on Passover when chametz is prohibited, it serves as a separation between the possible impurity source (such as a dead rat) and the trough. On all other days of the year, it depends upon his caring about it: if he objects to the dough being there, then it is not part of the trough. Therefore, it separates the trough impurity. If he does not mind the dough being there, it becomes as if part of the trough, and if a dead rat touches this dough, the whole trough becomes impure.

Pesachim 46 – Deaf dough

If the other dough leavened, we assume that the one in question leavened also. But what if we don’t have another dough? Then we assume that the dough leavens in the time it takes one to walk a “mil,” or about two thousand steps, which is eighteen minutes. The same eighteen minutes appear in many other laws.<br />
<br />
If one bakes dough on Passover itself, and this dough is ritually impure, as all our doughs today are, then he has a problem with “challah,” the kohen’s portion, as follows. He cannot bake it because one can only cook foods that will be eaten, and impure challah needs to be destroyed. Nor can he leave it over because it will leaven. Rabbi Eliezer suggests not declaring the challah portion until all dough is baked, and only then combine all the matzot in the basket and separate one as challah (by now, it is not chametz), and destroy it. Ben Beteira suggests putting it in a cool water place until the end of the Yom Tov when one will be allowed to bake it. Finally, Rabbi Yehoshua says that this challah can be separated, and if it leavens – let it be. Why? It does not belong to the owner because it is for the kohen. Nor does it belong to any specific kohen. Therefore, this is not chametz that was prohibited by the Torah.
<br />

The Talmud discusses why each of the disputants does not accept the solution of the other two.

Pesachim 47 – Since

If one bakes bread close to the end of a Holiday, essentially for the weekday following, then he is liable to punishment – says Rav Chisda. One is not allowed to cook during a Holiday other than for the needs of this Holiday.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbah says that since guests may happen to visit him just before the end of the day, and then he would feed this bread to them, therefore even now, he can be considered baking for a valid purpose, and thus he is not liable.
<br />
<br />
This principle of “since” has so many implications that it gets a special name, “since,” or “hoyil” in Hebrew. Therefore Rav Chisda and Rabbah begin to argue about it. For example, they discuss the following case.
<br />
<br />There is a situation where one can plow a single furrow and transgress eight times because of that. How so? – Firstly, he plows with an ox and a donkey tied together. Then, those animals are consecrated as sacrifices. Furthermore, he is sowing wheat in a vineyard. Besides, it is the seventh year (Shmita) when plowing is forbidden; moreover, he is doing this during a Holiday. He is a Kohen and a Nazirite, and he is plowing in a cemetery, which neither a Kohen nor a Nazirite can visit.  That’s eight. However, if the principle of “since” is true, then it should be only seven transgressions, and he should not be liable for plowing itself because, with the act of plowing, he produces dust, which can be used to cover the blood of a bird, a requirement of kosher slaughter. And “since” he can use the dust for this, it should not be counted! 
<br />
<br />
That is a question that Rav Chisda asked of Rabbah. However, Rabbah answered that he is plowing the rocky ground, with no dust. And the discussion continued.

On <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/09/pesachim-47-since.html">the previous page</a>, we discussed baking bread (unleavened, of course) close to the end of a holiday, when one is full and cannot eat what he will bake. However, <i>since</i> should the guests chance, they will come and eat his bread, he is not liable for using the Holiday to prepare for a weekday. The principle of “<i>since</i>” had a champion in Rabbah, but Rav Chisda did not accept this way of reasoning.
<br />
<br />
Earlier, however, we saw a similar argument about baking matzah on Passover's holiday, when the dough was ritually impure. Rabbi Eliezer allowed it. Can we say that he too agrees with the principle of <i>since</i>, and he allowed it because of this: <i>since</i> one could bake each loaf separately, it was OK for him to bake all of them together and then designate one matzah as the kohen’s portion? 
<br />
<br />
If the Talmud can, it will try to combine the disagreements and find the same root cause. However, this does not work here. Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer used the <i>since</i> principle for matzah baking only<i>&nbsp;</i>because each individual loaf is at least suited for him. However, in the case of guests, where he himself is full and cannot eat the bread, the principle of <i>since</i> would not t apply.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Rabbi Yehoshua may reverse his position. Maybe he only opposes the <i>since</i> principle in the case of matzah baking, where the impure challah portion was not fit for anyone. However, in the case of baking at the end of a holiday, where the food he is preparing would at least be good for the guests – there, Rabbi Yehoshua could agree to the principle of <i>since</i>.&nbsp;<br />

However, the Sages disagree and say that the first one begins to knead; then, when she begins to form the loaf, the other begins to knead; when the first one puts the loaf in the oven, the third one begins to knead, and so on. They disagree on how much you can trust the average person on Passover. Rabbi Akiva claims that not all women and not all ovens are the same, so there seems to be no way to decide the law. However, a general rule is simply this: if she notices that the dough begins to leaven, she dips her hands in cold water, and that’s enough.
<br />
<br />
The dough that began to leaven must be burned, but one is still not liable for eating it; however, if it is beyond the first leavening stage, it still must be burned, and one how eats it is liable. What is the sign of the first stage above? – Cracks like the antennae of locusts.  And of the second? – When the cracks interlace. These signs are given by Rabbi Yehudah. However, Rabbi Meir disagrees and says that there are many more cracks inside once you have any surface cracks, and the dough has already leavened. What then is the first stage? When the dough is pale like the face of a person whose hair stands on end because of fright.

The Talmud also discusses the deplorable state of unlearned people.

Pesachim 5 – Why stop eating chametz already before Passover?

Why? Here is Abaye’s explanation.
<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1836">For seven days, chametz should not be found in your homes</a>.” However, it also said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1832">But on the first day, you should destroy chametz</a>.” What is there to destroy if, on the first day, you can’t even find it? Therefore, it must be that by “first day” in this context, the Torah means “prior” day. Very well, but if so, it should be the whole day!? – that is the meaning of the word “but,” which comes to limit the new rule, and it is logical to limit it to a half-day. Thus, the clear result: chametz is prohibited for eating after midday before Passover, but the more serious consequence of being cut off from one’s people for one who eats chametz – that starts only when the Passover really begins.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then finds many more ways to prove that chametz is prohibited half a day prior to Passover. This need is probably due to all of the proofs having complicated derivation or because none of them is obvious.

In the Temple's times, people did not work on the day before Passover: this was a day of bringing a Passover sacrifice, and it had a character of a holiday. Later, some people adopted a custom to refrain from work on this day, while others did not. Therefore, if one is from a town where they work on this day, and he comes to a town where they don’t – he, too, should not do any work. In general, one should follow the local custom to avoid disagreements. Moreover, if he comes from a town with a more stringent custom, he is bound by it too. Therefore, one receives the stringencies of the place he left and the stringencies of the place he came to.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, on the Shmita year, one has to remove from his possession the fruit he has collected, once they are finished in the fields, and leave it for everyone to use. If he comes to a place where they are already putting the fruit into the streets for everyone’s enjoyment, he too has to do it, even if in his home town the time to remove the fruit has not come yet and vice versa.

However, here is an example of a custom adopted by the unlearned masses on their own: the people of Chozai separated the kohen’s portion (challah) from dough made of rice. This is not required at all, and Rav Yosef wanted to send a non-kohen who would eat such “challah” in front of them, thus proving that their custom had no validity. Abaye wanted to stop him, using our previous rule to not deviate from an existing custom. However, Rav Yosef replied that this does not apply to a wrong custom adapted by unlearned masses.<br />
<br />
It turns out that there are two levels of ignorance. Totally unlearned masses should keep their wrong customs because once you start abrogating these customs, they will eventually confuse all the laws. However, a custom which was initially adopted with the consent of a Sage - such custom, if found erroneous, can, later on, be argued against, because the group of people with some education will understand the difference: they will accept the eradication of the wrong custom but keep the other rules intact.
<br />
<br />
Here is an example. The two sons of Rabban Gamliel bathed together in the city of Kabul. The populace was amazed, saying, “We have not seen such behavior ever in our lives.” At which one of the brothers left the bath, but he did not wish to tell them, “You are wrong, two brothers are allowed to bathe together, it is only that two brothers-in-law are not (because this may lead one to wrong thoughts about his sister).” Why didn’t they abrogate the custom? – Because the people of Kabul,  although somewhat learned, were rarely visited by Sages.

As the Torah said, it “s<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=25#P3474">hall [also] be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land</a>.”<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar takes it literally: if one has taken such produce outside of Israel, then when the time for removing it from his home comes, he must travel back to Israel and offer it “in your land.” Rav Safra once traveled outside of Israel with a barrel of Shmita wine. He asked his companions, “What did your teacher, Rav Abahu, say about this? Is the law strict like Rabbi Shimon or no?” Rav Kahana answered that the teacher said yes, but Rav Huna told him that the teacher said no.” At this, Rav Safra said, “I will take the words of Rav Huna because he is always very precise in transmitting the sayings of his teacher.”
<br />
<br />
However, with this, he also saved himself a lot of trouble with the barrel. Rav Yosef applied to him the following verse, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1304.htm">My people use voodoo divination, and listen to a stick</a>.” In Hebrew, a "stick" is “makel,” which also has the meaning of “lenient.” That is, whoever is more lenient, that is whose opinion you, Rav Safra, prefer.

Pesachim 53 – Customs not to follow

One may sell an ox or a horse just before Shabbat, the buyer may then ask to demonstrate the animal’s prowess, and the Jew would spur it on with his voice, thus causing the animal to work on Shabbat.  (This prohibition is not in force today).
<br />
<br />
Some communities adopted a prohibition not to sell small livestock – so that one does not come to sell large livestock. Others say that the prohibition was added to prevent bestiality. However, this is a kind of custom that was not generally adopted, and one is not obligated to conform to it, even in a city where everyone else does so.
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, in some places, people had the custom to light a candle in a house on Yom Kippur's night, and in some – not to light it. However, both were intended for the good: those who lighted did so to prevent cohabitation on Yom Kippur since, in general, it is prohibited with the light of a candle. Those who did not light did so to not see the beauty of the spouse and not be aroused by it.<br />

Pesachim 54 – What happened after Shabbat

To commemorate this, people light a candle with multiple wicks and enjoy its light. The Talmud discusses ten things that were created before Shabbat, such as Miriam's well, the manna, the script, the mouth of Balaam’s donkey. Incidentally, seven things are concealed from people, among them the day of death, the day when one’s depression will lift, the knowledge of other’s thoughts, what business one will be successful in, and when the Messiah will come.
<br />
<br />
Continuing with the customs that one should observe together with the local residents, in some places, there was a custom to abstain from work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B'Av">Tisha B’Av</a>, to concentrate on mourning, and if this is the custom, one should follow it. Only distracting labor requiring significant exertion is forbidden. If the place does not have such a custom – this is valid also. However, the Sages should abstain from work on Tisha B’Av regardless of the local custom because they should feel the Temple loss more keenly than the rest. 
<br />
<br />
If one wants to behave like a Sage on Tisha B’Av, abstaining from work, this is permissible, and there is no haughtiness there – so says Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And indeed, if an onlooker sees him idle on that day, he will not necessarily conclude that the person is trying to assume the honor due to a Sage. Rather, he will think to himself, “He just does not have work. See how many idlers are out there in the street.”

In the late afternoon of this day, the Israelis used to bring the Passover lamb sacrifice in the Temple. And since the day of bringing a sacrifice is a personal holiday, the 14th of Nissan would acquire a Holiday character when work is not done. How much of a Holiday it was depended on who you ask.<p></p><p>Rabbi Meir said that a job started before the 14th day could be completed on the 14th. But the Sages say that this permission applies only to the following three crafts: tailors, barbers, and launderers. Why these? Tailors - because even during the seven days of Passover, sewing will be allowed if done non-professionally. Barbers and launderers - because even during the Holidays, people who just returned from an overseas journey or who just got out of prison would be allowed to be cut their hair and launder their clothes.</p><p>Today, in the absence of the Passover sacrifice, these limitations are largely removed, although it is still recommended to spend the 14th preparing for the Passover holiday.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Chardin.

In our case, the people there did three things that they got away with, and three other things that the Sages took umbrage with. The people grafted palm trees even in the afternoon before Passover (Jericho was the city of palms, after all). They said the Shema prayer too quick and skipped some words. They would also harvest their grain before the day when all fresh grain products (<a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/05/menachot-68-remembering-temple.html" target="_blank">chadash</a>) became permitted for consumption. They got away with it because it was not such a big deal. For example, they could promise not to consume the harvested grain.<p></p><p>However, they got into trouble for the following. They would permit for personal use new branches that grew on trees dedicated to the Temple. True, one was not liable for a penalty for using these branches, but they nevertheless were prohibited for use. They would make it easy for the poor to come on Shabbat and collect fruit under the trees. The Sages forbade it so that the people would not start picking the fruit from the trees directly, which would be prohibited on Shabbat. Thirdly, Jericho's people were wont to leave over the <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-6-so-finally-may-not-or-can-not.html" target="_blank">pe'ah</a> (corner of the field) from vegetables. The people thought that was an act of extra charity since vegetables do not have this law. However, it led to another problem. Since the pe'ah was not really required, one had to separate the tithe. The poor would assume that the tithe was already separated from the vegetables and eat this, thus inadvertently eating produce not tithed.</p><p>Art: The Apple Gatherers, Frederich Morgan, 1880</p><div><br /></div>

When a sacrifice was brought in the Temple, the hide remaining from it belonged
to all the Kohanim (priests). They used to leave these hides in a special
chamber in the Temple for later distribution. However, the bullies among the
Kohanim would take the hides by force. They tried to push the hide distribution
to the end of the week, hoping that bullies would not misbehave in the presence
of multitudes. But now, the high-ranking Kohanim would appropriate the hides.
Since nothing helped, the owners dedicated the hides to the Temple treasury. As
a result, the treasury gained much money, and soon the Sanctuary was covered
with gold plates. These beautiful plates were then displayed for the pilgrims on
the Holidays.
<p></p>
<p>
  Sometimes, the Temple courtyard itself cried out in anguish because of the
  wrongdoings. The first was "Depart from here, the sons of Eli, the High
  Priest!" The second was because of Issachar from Barkai - who wore silken
  gloves while doing the services. This invalidated the service, which has to be
  done with bare hands. But for a High Priest Yochanan ben Narbi, the courtyard
  proclaimed, "Raise your heads, O gates!" He generously served his guests three
  hundred calves for dinner, three hundred wine barrels, and the volume of
  mikveh of meat of young birds for dessert. As a result, there were never
  sacrifice meat leftovers.

All other offerings should be brought on it, that is, on the first permanent&nbsp;offering. Other offerings were often peace offerings, "shlamim".

Thus, one should complete all other offerings after the first but before the second <i>tamid</i>.</p><p>Passover offering was the only exception to this rule: it had to be brought after the afternoon <i>tamid</i>. Since the Passover offering required time and had to be ready for the Seder, the <i>tamid</i> was brought an hour earlier. If the Passover sacrifice day fell out of Friday, they needed all the time they could get - for slaughtering the sacrifice and roasting - which could not be done on Shabbat. Therefore, on such an occasion, they brought the second tamid soon after midday, and then they would follow with the Passover.</p><p>Art: Still Life with a Cut of Meat by Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin</p>

On the one hand, it said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=13#P1875">No leaven shall be seen with you in your territory.</a>“ So I might think that if I hide it, then it is allowed. I might also think that with me it cannot be seen, but if it belongs to someone else, such as a barrel of whiskey that someone left as a deposit, then it would be allowed.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the Torah also said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1836">No leaven may be found in your homes.</a>” &nbsp;This means that even hidden chametz should not be found, and even someone else’s chametz is not allowed to be deposited with me.
<br />
<br />
How does one resolve this? – It all depends on who accepts responsibility. If a Jew stores someone else’s chametz without any promises and guarantees, such that if it is stolen, he is not responsible, and in addition, he rents that place in his house where the non-Jew’s chametz is stored – then it is allowed. However, if he accepts responsibility for it, it becomes in some sense his, and that chametz should not be found in the Jew’s home.
<br />
<br />
For example, non-Jewish soldiers used to deposit flour with the residents of the city of Mechozah, and Jewish bakers would bake bread for them. The bakers accepted the responsibility, and Rava told them that this was not allowed on Pesach. However, if they could find someone else who would accept responsibility for them, then it would become allowed.

We also saw that if one changes from the right intention to the wrong one, he invalidates the offering. The question that remained was this: when did he change his mind? For example, when he said, "This is a Passover offering, a peace offering," did he change his mind during a single service, such as the slaughter of the sacrifice, or did he think or talk about Passover offering during slaughter and about peace offering during subsequent walking to the Altar with the blood in the vessel?<p></p><p>This depends on how we understand his statement, "This is a Passover offering, a peace offering." If we take both parts of his statement seriously, we say that he really wanted to change his mind. He, therefore, invested the sacrifice with both qualities. Since this is impossible: it's either Passover or peace offering, he ruined it completely - at least, as far as offerings are concerned. Practically, the animal has to graze in the pasture until it accidentally gets some blemish (<a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/12/bechorot-40-blemishes-of-tail-testicles.html">for example, in the foot or tail</a>), making it invalid as a sacrifice, and then it is sent home. That is actually the view of Rabbi Yosi.</p><p>But if we say that we only listen to the first part of what he is saying, and do not recognize the second part of his statement, then the animal is still a valid sacrifice. The change of mind must have happened on another step of the service. That would agree with Rabbi Meir's view.</p><p>The Talmud tries to decide when he changed his mind - completely inside a certain step of the service or between two steps - and remains unable to do so.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Return of the Flock by Anton Mauve&nbsp;</p>

The Passover offering must be brought, having in mind the people who can eat it, who have signed up for it, and <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/01/pesachim-59-what-did-you-have-in-mind.html">who are circumcised</a>. What if he brought it for someone who has not signed up for this lamb and who is not circumcised? The uncircumcised person cannot eat the Passover, and he is not even part of the Seder! He is so far removed from it that slaughtering it for him does not invalidate the sacrifice. Right? - Wrong, says Rav Chisda. <i>Since</i> he could circumcise himself, it is as if he can eat it now.<p></p><p>But wait, Rav Chisda! You yourself did not agree with the principle of <i>since</i>. When we talked about baking at the very end of a Holiday, Rav Chisda did not allow the logic of "<i>since</i>&nbsp;guests might still come and eat it on a Holiday, let's bake!" Here is the answer: Rav Chisda would not allow using <i>since</i> for leniency (like to permit baking). He would allow the reasoning of <i>since</i> for stringency, like to declare the sacrifice invalid.</p><p>Art: Woman baking bread by&nbsp;Jean-Francois Millet</p>

Rabbi Shimon qualifies that he only transgresses if he has the right intentions for the sacrifice. Otherwise, his sacrifice is invalid, and according to Rabbi Shimon, any slaughter that is not valid is not considered slaughter at all. Thus, he is not liable for an additional prohibition of slaughtering while owning chametz.</p><p>Furthermore, Resh Lakish says that the chametz must be with him in the Temple Courtyard. Why is that? - To be liable for any prohibition, one must receive a warning just before the act. If this chametz is not with him but is at his home, the witnesses giving the warning can never be sure that the chametz indeed exists in his possession. Therefore, their warning will be conditional, like "keep in mind that if you have chametz - then..." and conditional warnings do not count.</p><p>Art: Slaughtering by Jan Stobbaerts</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

The group comes in, the gates close, the Levites blow the trumpets. The Kohanim priests stood ready in rows. Some rows had all golden vessels and some - all silver.<p></p><p>The sacrifice owner would slaughter it (if he knew how), and a Kohen would receive the blood and pass it to the next Kohen in line. This continued until they reached the Kohen closest to the Altar, who would then throw the blood on the Altar's wall. Everybody sang the Hallel. If they had to, they would repeat it, but Kohanim were fast, and they seldom had to repeat the Hallel, and definitely not sing it the third time.</p><p>There were hooks on which they could suspend and flay the offerings. For those for whom there was not a hook, there were planks of wood. One could set the plank on his and his friend's shoulder and flay it.</p><p>Three groups of people were a requirement, but the third was called "the lazy group." This agrees with Rabbi Yehudah's philosophy that "The world needs perfume makers and leather makers (which is associated with bad odor). But one should strive to be among perfume makers."</p><p>Art: Potpourri by Herbert James Draper</p>

One can do the slaughter, throw the blood on the Altar walls, and remove the intestines and the waste. However, roasting the meat can and should be done after Shabbat.<p></p><p>Likewise, such acts as carrying the sacrifice on one's shoulders to the Temple or bringing it from afar do not override Shabbat rules. Here Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and says that they do override Shabbat because, in his view, the love of the mitzvot tells us to violate Shabbat in preparing for a mitzvah that will be done on Shabbat.</p><p>As Rabbi Eliezer got carried away defending his position, Rabbi Akiva prepared a trap for him. He constructed a logical argument that seemed to uproot the teachings of the Torah. He said, "Look at the mitzvah of purifying one for the Passover - it did not become permitted on Shabbat even though it was needed! So, Rabbi Eliezer, don't be surprised that the Torah did not allow the Passover sacrifice to be brought on Shabbat."</p><p>Rabbi Eliezer fell for it and exclaimed, "Akiva! You are ruining what the Torah said! It told us to bring the sacrifice<b>&nbsp;at the appointed time</b>!" Now Rabbi Akiva countered, "Please show me where the Torah says <b>the appointed time</b> for those other acts that you allow."</p><p>Art: Vendor of Roast Meat by&nbsp; Pietro Longhi&nbsp;</p>

After one finishes <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/06/pesachim-4-why-search-for-chametz-so.html">searching for and destroying his chametz</a>, he must also declare whatever he missed as ownerless, the dust of the earth, and not belonging to him. Why is that? He just destroyed all his chametz anyway!?
<br />
<br />
One reason is that he might find a nice loaf of bread later. Since it is nice, he will desire it and in his mind own it, at least for a few seconds, and thus transgress the prohibition of owning chametz. Declaring it ownerless helps.
<br />
<br />
Still, why does he need to declare the chametz that is unknown to him ownerless? He might as well say this declaration the minute he sees the bread!? – By the time Pesach comes, it is not in his power to declare it ownerless. 
<br />
<br />
Here we have an interesting paradox, as Rabbi Elazar puts it. There are two things that are not in the possession of a man, yet the Torah holds him responsible as if they were his. The first one is a pit in the street. If one opens it, then even though it does not belong to him, he still pays for the damages caused by the pit. The second one is chametz on Pesach: even though one cannot use it for any purpose or derive benefit from it (so technically it does not belong to him,) the Torah still considers it as if he transgressed “No leaven should be found with you on Passover” when it is found in his domain.

However, Ben Beteira thinks differently and holds that it is exactly the same as Passover offering in most respects. Even though Ben Beteira's view does not become the accepted law, the Talmud spends significant effort investigating what Ben Beteira thinks about various aspects of Passover.<p></p><p>An even more special situation is found in the next rule that talks about finding a knife and a cleaver right before Passover. The knife is for the Passover offering where, by the way, the bones are not allowed to be broken. The cleaver is for Chagigah, the Festival offering, where there is no such prohibition. But the only situation when the two will be treated the same is when the community was pure on the day before Passover and suddenly became impure the next day. And the only situation where <i>that</i> can happen is when the head of the Sanhedrin, de-facto spiritual ruler, was on the verge of death before Passover. The community was all pure, but there was an all-too-real possibility that they will all go to his funeral the next day and thus become impure. The Talmud does not comment if this combination of events ever occurred in history.</p><p>Art: Carcass of Beef by Rembrandt</p><p><br /></p>

However, if his slaughter is invalid, he has transgressed Shabbat, albeit retroactively, and now he needs to atone for it by bringing a sin-offering after the Holidays. For example, this happens when he takes a Passover offering and brings it for the sake of peace offering, which makes it completely invalid.<p></p><p>However, if he takes a peace offering and slaughters it as Passover, he has done at least some sort of a mitzvah, and Rabbi Yehoshua says that he does not need to bring a sin-offering.&nbsp;</p><p>If the animal had a blemish (which invalidates any offering), he should have checked it before the slaughter. That is negligence, and even Rabbi Yehoshua says that he is liable to a sin-offering. But if it is invalid due to an animal's internal defect, then everybody agrees that there is no sin-offering because it was like an unavoidable accident. The meat is not kosher and cannot be eaten, but he is not to blame.</p><p>Art: Butcher’s Stall by Pieter Aertsen</p>

Pesachim 8 – The light of a candle

We mentioned before that one should search for chametz using the light of a candle. Why a candle? It comes through a chain of associations. Chametz should “not be found.” This leads to remembering Joseph who “searched and found” (a divining goblet in the sack of Benjamin). The “found” leads to the words of the prophet who promises that God will look for the errors of the people of the city of Jerusalem using the light of candles, and not “find” any. And finally “candles” leads to the words of King Solomon that “The soul of a man is the candle of God, which God uses to inspect the deeds of man."
<br />
<br />
Why do we need the last connection, from “candles” to “candle?” It is already pretty clear and close by then! – Because one might think that searching with candles is leniency, and God will overlook some errors precisely because of using candles. To show that this is untrue,  we bring the last proof of the candle being the light of God.
<br />

Still, why not use a torch? First, because with the torch he will be afraid to examine nooks and crevices, since he may cause a fire. Also, a torch gives unsteady flame, while that of a candle is constant. Yet another reason is that one carries a torch behind himself, and the candle he carries in front.

It fixed the defects of sacrifices, but not all the defects. Thus, if someone brought his Passover offering and even threw its blood on the Altar, but then they discovered that the meat or the blood became ritually impure, it is the <i>tzitz</i> that effects the acceptance. What is the use of acceptance if the meat cannot eaten? At least, he has fulfilled his obligation and won't have to bring another sacrifice. He will eat matzah and other things at the Seder.<div><br /></div><div>What if they discovered that he himself was ritually impure? Here the <i>tzitz</i> does not help, and he will have to bring the Passover offering a month later, on <i>Pesach Sheni</i>. However, here is a special exception. If he was impure due to the "impurity of the depth," his Passover offering is valid, and he will not have to bring another one - all due to the <i>tzitz</i>. What is this special "impurity of the depth?" - This is something that absolutely nobody knew about, such as a corpse under the house, unknown to anybody, that was discovered later.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Study of the Head of a Corpse by Charles Emile Champmartin</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

So, if a Passover offering became ritually impure, the whole thing or the majority of its meat - it was burnt in this place. When burning the offering, one was allowed to use the Temple wood. Even though he was using Temple property for his purposes, this was allowed - to prevent people from eating disqualified meat when they faced the expense of buying the wood to burn it.<p></p><p>If only a small portion of the sacrificial meat became impure, one would take it home and burn it there, in the courtyard or on the roof, and use his own wood. That would have to happen within the City of Jerusalem, called today, "The Old City." Cheapskates would burn even small amounts of impure meat next to the Temple - to take advantage of the Temple wood.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Dutch farmworker gathering wood by Hans Heysen</p><p><br /></p>

Therefore, the marrow inside the bones cannot be removed." But any edible part of a sacrifice becomes <i>notar</i>, or leftover, on the next day and has to be burned. So leftover bones must be burned.<p></p><p>The same is true for the sinews and leftover meat of the sacrifice. They all must be burned on the next day after the Seder. If that day fell out on Shabbat, they wait till yet the next day. Although it is a mitzvah, the burning of the leftover does not override either Shabbat or the Holiday.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Still Life with a Goat Head&nbsp; Jusepe de Ribera</p>

"Enough" means the volume of an average olive. But what is considered "meat?" - Any part that will be tender enough to eat in a grown-up animal is considered "meat." But any part that will harden in a grown-up ox is not considered meat towards the olive volume.<p></p><p>We already mentioned that one is <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/02/pesachim-83.html">not supposed to break the bones</a> of a Passover sacrifice. One can even be punished for doing so (of course, the usual rules of giving him a warning not to do it, within a few seconds before the act, apply). However, one is not punished for another prohibited action - leaving the meat over till morning. Why not? Some say - because you cannot punish for not doing. Others - that anytime something is prohibited but a correction is suggested - here, by burning it, you can't punish for it.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Butcher's shop by&nbsp;Annibale Carracci</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

If it is taken out, it becomes disqualified, cannot be eaten, and has to be burned.<p></p><p>What happens if a part of the sacrifice protrudes outside this boundary? His problem is that he cannot chop the protruding portion off because he <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/02/pesachim-83.html" target="_blank">cannot&nbsp;break the sacrifice bones</a>. Therefore, he cuts into the flesh until he reaches the bone, then peels the flesh away until he gets to the join, and now he can cut off the entire bone. He does not have to take such precautions for other sacrifices but just chops it with a cleaver.</p><p>What about the doors (which, in an ancient city, could have significant depth)? The doorway, which is also called "doorjamb," is considered as outside of Jerusalem. By contrast, the windows are considered inside. Why such a difference? They should all be considered as inside Jerusalem. However, when the city was originally consecrated, the gateways were not included on purpose.

Once they are registered and the time to eat it comes, they cannot change their minds. They must eat it in the house where they started and cannot change this either. However, before starting the Seder, if they decide to separate into two groups, they are perfectly allowed to do so.<p></p><p>There was a custom to dilute the intense wine served at the table with hot water. The water would come from a kettle, and the kettle could be positioned between the groups - again, this separation created no problem. However, the waiter who would be pouring this water had to be careful to eat with only one group. When he is serving the other group members, he keeps his mouth shut until he returns to his own group. A bride who is at the Seder with her new family for the first time can turn the face away, not observing the rules of the waiter.</p><p>Rav Huna once came to a new place. His actions seemed unusual to the people there, and they questioned him about every one of them. For example, he said that his name was Rav Huna. That seemed presumptuous - just give you name, no "Rav!" - He said, I was called Rav Huna since childhood. When he drank, he did not turn his face away. That looked immodest to them.

Similarly, a half-slave cannot eat the sacrifice because it is assumed that the master only wanted to register his part of the slave, not the free part. (A half-slave is a hint to a person who is governed both by his good inclination and his even inclination.) If so, why did we learn in another source that the slave can eat the sacrifice? - That is talking about the case when the slave's two owners are at peace with each other.<p></p><p>If one sent his slave to slaughter a sacrifice for him but did not tell which we wanted, a young goat or a lamb, he can eat whichever animal the slave chose.

Can they find the precedent in the earlier case of one inviting more guests, or can he argue back and say, "You accepted me!" The Talmud goes through a few possible precedents until it finds convincing proof that the glutton can be asked to leave.</p><p>A similar story happened to Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, who sat together (not on Passover) to eat bread. While Rav Huna ate one piece, Rav Pappa ate four. So Rav Huna wanted to separate, but Rav Pappa argued that "You accepted me!" They went through all the precedents mentioned above until Rav Huna quoted a decisive one and separated from Rav Pappa. He then joined with Ravina, but Ravina ate two times faster than even Rav Pappa.

The same is true of one's room: once it is searched, one need not think that a weasel might bring it there from another room. This is true because if one is to be concerned, he would have to suspect that a weasel brought it from another courtyard or another town, and there would be no end to his worries.
<br />
<br />
However, as the Talmud notes, this rule is good only if one does not see a weasel or a mouse, going into his house <b>with bread</b>. If he does, then he has to be concerned. But why? Why not say that the mouse ate that bread?! After all, we have multiple rulings which assume that if a mouse or a weasel are found in a place where possibly ritually impure meat was dropped, then it was surely eaten, and the place is therefore ritually clean!? – True, they will eat the meat, but as for the bread, they will leave some over and hide it.
<br />
<br />
And yet, we do worry about weasels, since all food that is left over after the search for chametz is hidden and not put in an easily accessible place – obviously because a weasel may take it away. Abaye explained, “Yes, the weasel may hide it just before Pesach when soon there will be no bread available, but not earlier when there is plenty.” Rava objected, “Is a weasel a prophetess that she knows that soon there will be no bread?! – Rather, the danger is that the weasel will take it away in one's presence, and then he will have to search again.”

If one is ritually impure in the afternoon but will be pure the next day, that is, when evening comes and the Holiday of Passover begins, they can slaughter a sacrifice for him. Even though he is not pure now, he will be pure when he sits down to eat it at the Seder.<p></p><p>What could be an example of this? A <i><a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html" target="_blank">zav</a></i> (a special kind of male impurity) who experienced two discharges must count seven days without discharges and immerse himself in a flowing spring. After that, he is pure once the night begins. So, that is exactly the case we are talking about if today he counted his seventh day. Even if this zav had three discharges, which obligates him in an additional offering - they can still slaughter the Passover lamb for him. He will be pure at night, and he will bring the additional offering later on, but he can come to the Seder and eat.</p><p>Art: Waterfall in Telemark by August Cappelen</p>

Since different offerings have different laws, we cannot bring any of the animals because we don't know which is which. The solution? - Let them all graze until they develop a blemish, and sell them, and use that money to buy each type of sacrifice in the mix. Each new sacrifice must cost as much as the most expensive one in the original mix.<p></p><p>Another problem: a group of people lost their Passover sheep. They made one of them a messenger to find it. He found it and slaughtered it for them. But they, being afraid that he won't find the animal, got another one and slaughtered it. Which one do they eat now?</p><p>The answer: if he slaughtered his first, then it is the group's offering, and all eat from it. If they slaughtered theirs first, they eat the new one, but the messenger eats the original one because he slaughtered it for himself. What if they do not know which one was slaughtered first? He still eats his, but they cannot eat any because they do not know which one is theirs. However, since one of the two is definitely theirs - it's just that they don't know which - they fulfilled the mitzvah and do not bring it on Second Passover.</p><p>Now there is a whole group of attempts to rectify this situation by making all kinds of conditions, but none works in all life situations. The conclusion is that it is better to be silent and not fix it with all kinds of clauses.</p><p>Art: A shepherd with his flock by Anton Mauve</p><div><br /></div>

Rosh Hashanah 10 – The New Year of trees

Why is it important to know how old a tree is? – Because for the first three years, the fruit of the tree is called "orlah" and cannot be eaten, so we need to know when to count the first year. As it turns out if the tree is planted at least 30 days before Rosh Hashanah, this is already considered the first full year of its life. Even so, after the third Rosh Hashanah, the fruit is not permitted immediately, but only after the fifteenth of Shvat, also known as "Tu B'Shvat."
<br />
<br />
From the rule above, we see that thirty days in a year a considered an entire year. However, this is only the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. By contrast, Rabbi Meir says that even one day in a year is already considered an entire year. If so, how does Rabbi Meir explains the rule of thirty days for orlah cited above? He says that the tree indeed needs thirty days to take root, but if not for that, even one day in a year would make it a year old.
<br />
<br />
We can see that these teachers agree on the month the world was created and place it in Nisan. How? – We will see this on the next page.

"Earth send forth vegetation" means the land that is only beginning to bring forth vegetation, and this is the spring month of Nisan. So in his opinion, the world was created in Nisan.</p><p>Rabbi Eliezer places other events also in Tishrei. This month, Abraham and Jacob were born, Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered, and Joseph went out of the Egyptian prison.

There is a new year (Rosh Hashanah) for vegetables, and it falls on the first of the month of Tishrei. What are the laws for vegetables? They relate to tithes.<p></p><p>In general, one has to give tithes of the grain that he collects in the land of Israel. The Sages extended this law to vegetables and obligated one to set aside tithes of vegetables before eating them. The obligation of tithes is year by year. Thus, if one picks a vegetable on the last day before Rosh Hashanah and then another after the sun goes down and it is already a new year, he must give the titles separately. He cannot give a tithe from the vegetables of one year for the next, nor the following year's tithe from this one.</p><p>(Incidentally, he cannot pick vegetables on the Rosh Hashanah day itself, so we assume that we are talking about a non-Jew he did it for him, and even that - on his own accord.)</p><p>Some more laws of the vegetables. The obligation to give tithes starts at the moment when one harvests it from the ground. However, one can still snack from them. Later, when one bundles the produce for the market to sell, one can no longer snack from it until he separates tithes. That is for the vegetables that are sold by bundles. If the vegetables are sold in baskets, the cutoff point for snacks is putting them in a basket.</p><p>Art: Vegetable Seller by Joachim Beuckelaer</p>

But what does this mean? Imagine that one has taken a vow which prohibits her any benefit from a particular fellow. Then she should observe it for a year, until the same month and the exact date come next year. However, if she vowed "this year," then she should not derive benefit from her friend until the first of Tishrei next year. This is true even if only one day is left before the first of Tishrei. Even those people who say that one day in a year cannot be counted a year - here they will agree to one day. That is because our vower intended to cause herself some suffering, which she has achieved even in one day.<div><br /></div><div>The Talmud now goes back to the discussion of tithes.

But did the Sages know when this happened? And in general, do we need to be so meticulous? Here the answer is yes. Otherwise, these measures would make little sense.

Why is this day significant in the life of a tree? Because by then, most of the rainy days of the season have passed. In Israel, rain does not fall throughout the year but only during the rainy season, from mid-autumn through winter. These rains cause sap to rise in the trees, and the new fruits of the tree are ready to emerge.<p></p><p>But wait! Didn't we say that the <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/05/rosh-hashanah-10-new-year-of-trees.html" target="_blank">New Year of the trees is on the first of Tishrei</a>? Yes, and yet there is no contradiction. The Tishrei New Year is to count the number of years in the life of a tree. For the first three years, the tree is "orlah," and its fruit cannot be used. In the fourth, its fruit is taken to Jerusalem and eaten there.</p><p>By contrast, Tu Bishvat is for separating tithes. In different years, there are different kinds of tithes. There is tithe for the poor and tithe to be eaten in Jerusalem. Tu Bishvat serves as a demarkation telling the year the fruit belongs and therefore the tithe that should be taken from it.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Large Tree by Paul Gauguin</p>

The etrog is treated as a tree fruit for the laws of <i>orlah</i>: for the first three years, the fruit of any tree in Israel cannot be eaten or even used. For the laws of <i>revai</i>: in the fourth year, the fruit is taken to Jerusalem and eaten there. For the laws of shmita: the fruits of the seventh year are free for all.<p></p><p>However, the etrog is like a vegetable for the laws of tithing. That is, the tithing obligation begins at the moment when it is picked. That is because, as a vegetable, the etrog keeps absorbing water and uses it for growth all the time until it is harvested. This opinion is not unanimous, and there were different practices regarding the etrog. For Rabbi Akiva, this was a practical issue. Once, he separated the tithes two times, according to two different opinions. The Talmud discusses whose opinions these were and what did his actions mean.</p><p>Art: The lemon by Edouard Manet</p>

That "life" and "death" refer to the spiritual state in the World to Come. That the terms "righteous" and "wicked" do not refer to what is commonly called "good" and "bad" deeds; instead, the measure of good and bad deeds is unknown to us and is unexpected.

Another approach is that "righteous" is a person whose merits outweigh his evil deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding, one who does not insist on his rights, and drops the entire matter when being offended - such a person deserves that in judgment, his bad deeds are also dropped.

<br />
<br />
However, the above list omits the fast days in Tammuz and Tevet, why is that? – Because in the times of the Temple these days were observed not as fasts but as days of feasts and happiness. Still, since the prophets knew that the Second Temple will also be destroyed, they did not abrogate the fast days for good. 
<br />
<br />
In fact, so many miraculous salvations happened in the days of the Second Temple that the Sages had to write down a scroll enumerating these minor festivals when fasting and eulogizing the dead were not allowed. It was called “The Scroll of Fasts.” Later, with the destruction of the Second Temple, these minor festivals were also canceled. Some say that they stayed since they were not related to the Temple. All agree that the amount of trouble and suffering magnified in the subsequent generations, and people became numb to them. Hence, they did not appreciate the deliverance from them either.

The calendar for Shabbat is different. Shabbat comes on the seventh day, and the court has no power to accelerate or delay this. By contrast, the first of the following month comes either twenty-nine or thirty days after the previous. Depending on the court's determination, the exact date for every Holiday, such as Rosh Hashanah and Passover, may change. This setting of the date will affect the dates when people can or cannot do work. It will also affect the dates when they can or cannot eat chametz and should eat matzah.<div><br /></div><div>Therefore, the court would send messengers who would travel to distant lands such as Babylonia and inform the Jewish community about the date when the New Moon was declared. There were a total of six months when this knowledge was necessary. One of them was Elul - because of Rosh Hashanah that followed that month. The other was the month of Tishrei - because of Yom Kippur on the tenth day of Tishrei. Why did they have to trouble the messengers two months in a row, seeing that the month of Elul was almost always twenty-nine days, and thus the month could be calculated directly? In setting the next month, the court took the needs of the whole nation into account.
