Rosh Hashanah 2 – Four New Years

How so?
<br />
<br />
The New Year for the (Jewish) kings starts on the first day of the month of Nisan. If a king ascended the throne even one day before Nisan, this is still considered the first year of his reign, and on the first of Nisan, they begin counting his second year. This year is then used in business documents, such as loan notes, to honor the king.
<br />
<br />
Why does there have to be a New Year for the Holidays (Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot)? – for promises. If someone promises a sacrifice, he needs to bring it within the following three Holidays, but he starts counting not from the day of the promise but from Nisan. In an extreme case, therefore, if he promises the sacrifice before Shavuot, he has five Holidays to bring it: Shavuot, Sukkot, Pesach, next Shavuot, next Sukkot.
<br />
<br />
The New Year of the animals is for animal tithe: all animals born in that year are tithed together. The New Year of the trees is for counting the first three years during which their fruit is prohibited – this is known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlah">orlah</a>."<br />

However, that would be incorrect since God told Moses, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1819" target="_blank">This new moon will signify the beginning of the month for you</a>."

Rosh Hashanah 21 – Two days of fasting on Yom Kippur?

In the times of the Sanhedrin, when the Court determined the New Moon with the witnesses' testimony, the messengers of the Court might not bring the news on time, and the exact day of the Holiday in the Diaspora was uncertain. Out of doubt, they observed two days.<br />
<br />
By the same token, Yom Kippur should also be observed for two days or forty-eight hours of uninterrupted fast. However, since the month preceding Yom Kippur (Elul) was usually short, it was sure when the real Yom Kippur was on the calendar. Nevertheless, Rava was used to observe Yom Kippur for two days in a row. It once happened that the Court made Elul thirty days long, and Rava thus justified his suspicion. Rav Nachman was once ready to eat on the night following a complete Yom Kippur when a man said to him that the Court had decreed Elul to become long, and therefore the next day was the true Yom Kippur. Rav Nachman, frustrated, applied to himself the phrase "our pursuers were quick," meaning that the man had come too fast before Rav Nachman had a chance to eat.
<br />
<br />
Since the exact date of Passover was essential to know so as not to eat leaven (something for which a person deserves being cut off from his people), the messengers of the Court were allowed to violate Shabbat but bring the news on time. The same also applied to Yom Kippur because of the fast. What Shabbat violations were permitted? Some say – all, others – only walking too far (beyond the "techum" area of two thousand steps).

<br />
<br />
The calendar month could only have one of the two: either twenty-nine or thirty days. If the month was short (twenty-nine days), they made it known with torches, and if it was long (thirty), then nothing had to be done. However, this system was based on trust and open to hacking; the followers of a certain sect led by Baitus messed it up by hiring witnesses, with the desire to mislead the Sages. It was then established to accept testimony from known people. They also lit their own torches, to confuse the court, and when this was uncovered, the Sages instituted sending messengers. 
<br />
<br />
We <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/05/rosh-hashanah-21-two-days-of-yom-kippur.html">mentioned before</a>&nbsp;that the establishment of the New Moon would also determine the dates for the Holidays. This was so important that the witnesses who would come to testify about having seen the new moon were allowed to violate Shabbat. Therefore, when they came to Jerusalem, they could be outside the area of two thousand steps which one can travel on Shabbat. They would sit in a big courtyard, established for this purpose, and enjoy festival meals prepared for them. Still, it was too restrictive, and Rabban Gamliel changed the law to allow them to go to any place in Jerusalem.

Rosh Hashanah 27 – How did they blow the shofar in the Temple

Why straight? – To symbolize that on that day, the man should be honest and straightforward. Others, however, say that it should be bent to symbolize submission and humility. By contrast, the two trumpets were placed in the center on public fast days, and shofars, their mouths plates with silver, were on their sides. The trumpets blew more extended notes, and the shofar's sound was short because, on a fast day, the trumpet was the main sound.
<br />
<br />
There were times when authorities prohibited the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah. This gave rise to the following question: what happens when one blows the shofar in a cave? – If he hears the sound of the shofar itself, without the accompanying echo, it works, but if he hears the echo – it is not valid. Similarly, if one passes by the synagogue when they blow the shofar there – and he listens with attention – it counts for him. And the one who blows the shofar should have everyone in mind.

Rosh Hashanah 28 - Blowing a misappropriated shofar
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKr0Bm7k5pFkfm5NA3KOr7kvw3KVPIc_3WggnJXMl5IP8S8dxc_wT7B25idGktQ3W_qRMei3boZQbEEMz6xr3CSoUGlrn2xWvyQokXq5JSLCoZn02mFMNlOABP_GO_Z3IiZfft6HtZCu1P/s1600/The+Donkey+by+Eugene+Joseph+Verboeckhoven.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKr0Bm7k5pFkfm5NA3KOr7kvw3KVPIc_3WggnJXMl5IP8S8dxc_wT7B25idGktQ3W_qRMei3boZQbEEMz6xr3CSoUGlrn2xWvyQokXq5JSLCoZn02mFMNlOABP_GO_Z3IiZfft6HtZCu1P/s1600/The+Donkey+by+Eugene+Joseph+Verboeckhoven.jpg" width="279" /></a>If one takes a horn of an animal that has been consecrated as a burnt offering, he should not use it to blow the shofar on Rosh Hashanah. However, if he did it, the following sequence of events occurs: since he misappropriated a part of the offering, he transgressed and owes a sacrifice. However, the misappropriated horn becomes his property. His blowing is now valid. By contrast, a peace offering belongs primarily to its owner, and the laws of misappropriation do not apply to it. Thus, if he blew its horn, it remained in its consecrated status, and the blowing is invalid as a mitzvah that came through transgression.<br />
<br />
Another take from Rava: When does the misappropriation occur? - After he has blown the shofar! When he was blowing, the shofar was still the property of the Temple, and the blowing is invalid. Thus, in both cases, it is invalid. Rava then reversed his opinion: in both cases, the blowing is valid. Why? The concept of benefit does not apply to mitzvot; instead, they are a yoke on one's neck. Thus, there is really no benefit and, consequently, no transgression involved in either case and in both cases, his blowing fulfills the mitzvah.<br />
<br />
Rava also said, "One who blows a shofar just for music's sake has nevertheless fulfilled the mitzvah since doing mitzvot does not require the intent." How could Rava say this? Didn't we learn that if one passes by the synagogue and hears the shofar, he fulfills the obligation - but only provided that he has the intent!? Answers Rava: "What kind of intent is meant? - to hear the shofar!" But that's precisely what the rule says!? - Rava meant to hear the shofar as an instrument of music and not imagine that it is a braying donkey. What about the one who blows? He certainly knows that he is not a donkey but a human, blowing a shofar. - He is trying to make barking or some other unmusical sounds and accidentally produces musical sounds.<br />

Rosh Hashanah 29 - Rosh Hashanah on Shabbat

Here is an example. "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=17#P1995">When Moses would raise his hand, Israel would prevail over Amalek, but when he lowered his hand, Amalek was stronger</a>." But do Moses' hands make or break the battle? Instead, when Israel "gazed upward," concentrating on the purpose of the fight, they would win. Thus, Moses's hands were only a signal to Israel. Others explain that the concentration of Israel was giving Moses the strength to pray. Another example: "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=21#P4346">Make a fiery serpent and place it on a pole, so that anyone bitten by a snake would look at the serpent and live</a>." Instead, when Israel "gazed upwards," they were healed.</div>
<br />
Even when Rosh Hashanah occurs on Shabbat, by right, people should blow the shofar nevertheless. However, since there is a danger that someone who is not skilled in the shofar will take it in his hands and go to a Sage to learn - and carrying objects in a public area is prohibited on Shabbat - the Sages decided to cancel blowing the shofar in this case. In Jerusalem, in the times of the Temple, when the presence of many Sages would ensure that Shabbat is observed, they would blow the shofar even on Shabbat.<br />
<br />
After the destruction of the Temple, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai established to still blow the shofar on Shabbat Rosh Hashanah in the city of Yavneh, where the Sanhedrin assembled. Here is how he did it. They told him, "Let's decide first if it is proper." He answered, "Let's blow now and afterward decide." So they blew the shofar. Then later, when they said, "Let's decide now," Rabbi Yochanan answered, "It is too late - the sound was already heard, and it is improper for the Court to retract its decision at this time."<br />

<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJM0GSc-cpikFYCKSQ05eCM_8RiKZkLQNKNsraoRSH1M4y5V4Ns_MBpm4pBUk2zNwQnzAQ_2Trk4BoV8yEFNCusZ7NeC-zbL5E231gE9dbwU1Z7N6JA_xq9HOdubBzGKsWMtKQw7W9RQoa/s1600/Moses+By+Antonio+Zanchi.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJM0GSc-cpikFYCKSQ05eCM_8RiKZkLQNKNsraoRSH1M4y5V4Ns_MBpm4pBUk2zNwQnzAQ_2Trk4BoV8yEFNCusZ7NeC-zbL5E231gE9dbwU1Z7N6JA_xq9HOdubBzGKsWMtKQw7W9RQoa/s1600/Moses+By+Antonio+Zanchi.jpg" width="294" /></a>The New Year of the Jewish kings is counted from the same month as the Exodus. Why? Because of the phrase "In <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a06.htm">the four hundred and eightieth year from Exodus... in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, he built the Temple</a>." There is a comparison between Exodus and the years of a Jewish king, so they start counting from the same month.
<br />
<br />
But how do we know that the New Year of Exodus is indeed counted from Nisan? Granted that it is not Tishrei because it is mentioned as not being the first in connection to Moses' last speech. So too, it is not Iyar because Iyar is mentioned as second. Still, it could be Tammuz, Av, or Adar, which are not mentioned together with their count number. Instead, this is derived from an extra word in the story of King Solomon.&nbsp;Solomon has built the Temple in the second month. "In the second" is repeated to tell us that Iyar is the second month, and therefore Nisan is the first.
<br />
<br />
Concerning this, the Talmud also discusses the chronology of king Koresh and whether he was a righteous person. It is mentioned that a "shagel" was sitting to his right. This could mean a queen or a female dog. On the theory that he was righteous, the word is taken to mean a queen, but if not - it means his consort, a female dog.

Rosh Hashanah 30 – Innovations of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai

The Talmud continues with his other innovations.<br />
<br />
He established two new laws to remember Jerusalem: waving the lulav and eating the new grain (chadash.) As a result, the possibility of the Temple being rebuilt any day or night was expressed in applicable laws. We discussed these in the Tractate Sukkah&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/03/sukkah-41-remembering-temple-and.html" target="_blank">here</a>. This is in the class of essential teachings, which are repeated in several places in the Talmud.<br />
<br />
He also re-established accepting New Moon witnesses any time of the day. Initially, this is how the law was, but in the time of the Temple, they changed this so that the order of the sacrifices would not accidentally go awry. Now that there was no Temple, this precaution was unnecessary, and Rabbi Yochanan repealed the law. This, incidentally, agrees with the rule that even if the original reason for the law goes away, it still needs a Court ruling to be repealed.

Rosh Hashanah 31 – What happens after the end of the world
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1rB_5vIVbwsKi7RRkBdEnODpEN_A2ZcfNH46ql-bw2fBs3CYK7iO2sh2ROxgvsH_fSHU44qbPjjS5H5Fay9Hb7zMMuy4IpBh561DTu4zieJ49L4E-TyoIwsVyIRBoyXe-XCFkxb7UiwNm/s1600/Harvesters+Resting+(or+Ruth+and+Boaz)+by+Jean-Francois+Millet.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="181" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1rB_5vIVbwsKi7RRkBdEnODpEN_A2ZcfNH46ql-bw2fBs3CYK7iO2sh2ROxgvsH_fSHU44qbPjjS5H5Fay9Hb7zMMuy4IpBh561DTu4zieJ49L4E-TyoIwsVyIRBoyXe-XCFkxb7UiwNm/s1600/Harvesters+Resting+(or+Ruth+and+Boaz)+by+Jean-Francois+Millet.jpg" width="320" /></a>Earlier, we mentioned that if the witnesses who saw the new moon came late, it could lead to mistakes in the sacrifices. What could go wrong was the song that the Levites used to sing, together with the sacrifice.  In this, connection the Talmud enumerated which songs were performed on each day of the week and explains why it was fitting, according to what happened on this particular day in the order of creation of the world. 
<br />
<br />
On Shabbat, they sang, "It is good to praise God." When a man emulates God by resting on Shabbat, he can perceive God's ways more clearly. One opinion says that this is about the last thousand years of the world when it will be destroyed, and for one day, God will reign alone (God's day is a thousand years). The other opinion says that this refers back to the first Shabbat of creation, but that the world will be destroyed not for one but two days (two thousand years). The destruction and non-existence refer only to physical activity. However, spiritually all the righteous souls will exist in harmony brought about by the absence of evil. After this, according to some, the world will exist again, with people living in the presence of God. This is discussed in depth at the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/search/label/Sanhedrin" target="_blank">end of the  Tractate Sanhedrin</a>&nbsp;and is mentioned here only parenthetically.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud discusses other novel laws of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, such as making it easier for the new moon witnesses to go to the Court meeting place and not to the residence of the Head of Sanhedrin. The ninth and the last was to stop putting the strip of red wool on Yom Kippur for all to see: if people were forgiven, it turned white, but if not, they were upset – so now that they could not see it, they would not be sad.<br />

Rosh Hashanah 32 – The prayers of Rosh Hashanah

Every theme is expressed by ten phrases. When these are said, we also blow the shofar. However, often they blow the shofar later in the prayer not to disturb the people's concentration.
<br />
<br />
There is a rule that mitzvot must be perform early and without delay. How can they delay the blowing of the shofar, which is the mitzvah of the day for Rosh Hashanah? – There was once a government decree against blowing the shofar, and it was delayed, not to arouse suspicion. It was kept in place later, out of concern that a similar decree might happen again. 
<br />
<br />
With all the importance of the shofar, one may not do the following to bring it on Rosh Hashanah: carry it from afar, ride a horse, dig it up from the rubble, nor swim in water for it. One may clean it with water or wine. If a child wants to play the shofar, not only he is not stopped, but they help him learn, even on Shabbat.

Rosh Hashanah 33 – What notes to blow on the shofar

<br />
There is also another note, a whimpering sound called “shevarim.” Three shevarim equal  in length to a long sound, tekiah, and three groups for three short notes (teruah) also equal in length to the long sound. Others reverse the understanding of the broken notes, “shevarim” and “teruah.” Their disagreement is about which human emotion is this more similar to, moaning or sobbing. 
<br />
<br />
If one played a long note, tekiah, two times longer than it should be – he has not gained anything since a note without interruption is still the same long note, so it is considered just one note. For example, suppose he played tekiah – teruah – tekiah and made the last note two times longer than the first. In that case, it is still not considered if he sounded the previous note in the first group and then started the second long note in the would-be second group.

Rosh Hashanah 34 – How important is the shofar?

There is no requirement for them to be adjacent to each other. However, if he heard them simultaneously from nine people, he has not fulfilled his obligation because he could not hear each sound clearly.<br />
<br />
It is better to be with those who know how to blow the shofar than with those who know how to pray. For example, if in one city they blow the shofar but do not know the prayers, and in another city they say the prayers but do not blow the shofar, he should go to the first city. 
<br />
<br />
But this rule seems obvious; why did the teacher have to state it? After all, the shofar requirement is from the Torah. The prayer was later decreed by the Sages. Of course, we should prefer to do the Torah commandment! Still, the rule contains a novelty. Even when it is doubtful whether they will blow the shofar, one should still go and try to hear it.<div><br />

The prayer is said by everyone silently, and then it is repeated by the prayer leader. However, Rabban Gamliel states that the prayer leader's words count as the prayer for everyone so that everyone else does not have to pray. This is true throughout the year, and even more so on Rosh Hashanah when the prayer is long and was unfamiliar to many, especially when there were no printed prayer books.
<br />
<br />
The Sages asked Rabban Gamliel, "According to your opinion that the prayer leader fulfills everyone's obligation, why do people first pray silently at all?" He answers, "To give them something to do while the prayer leader reviews what he is going to say." He then asked in return, "And according to you, why does the prayer leader go down next to the ark and repeat the prayer?" The Sages told him, "For the benefit of the unlearned." He concluded, "Just as the prayer leader's prayer works for the unlearned, so it works for everyone else!"
<br />
<br />
Some say Rabban Gamliel exempted even those far away in the fields and could not attend the services. Others say that just the opposite, he exempted only them because the circumstances beyond their control stopped them from praying, but those who are in the city and attend services should say the prayers. Today, of course, there are printed prayer books, and everyone is obligated to pray using these.

He starts counting from Pesach so that he has five Holidays to fulfill his promise at the maximum. However, this was the opinion of one teacher, Rabbi Shimon. There are four more opinions, and each has its own logical explanation.
<br />
<br />
By the way, sacrifices and all other promises to the Temple are governed by the same law. The first opinion is that he has three Holidays to go, and he starts from the next one; thus, he has three Holidays at the max, and then he has transgressed the “do not delay.” The logic here is clear: since the Torah mentioned the three Holidays, Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot, one extra time – this is precisely the law it wanted to teach us.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon pays attention to the order in which the Holidays were mentioned, and comes up wit the measure of five Holiday seasons. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=12#P5240">you will come... and you will bring</a>” teaches that he must come and bring his sacrifice on the very next Holiday. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says that “do it on the Holidays” teaches the minimum of plural – that is, two Holidays. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, says that Sukkot was mentioned an extra time to tell us that it represents the cutoff: even if one promised a sacrifice shortly before Sukkot, he must bring it no later than this Holiday.

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/05/rosh-hashanah-3-five-points-of-view.html">We saw</a> that one who promises a sacrifice to the Temple should not delay it. We also mentioned that many more promises should not be delayed, not just Temple sacrifices. However, how do we know that –  the Torah said the “do not delay” only in connection with sacrifices, not anything else?
<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5516">When you make a pledge to God your Lord, do not be late in paying it, since God will then demand it, and you will have committed a sin</a>.” Every additional word teaches an extra thought.<br />
<br />
“To God, your Lord” teaches that not delaying promises also applies to any donation to the Temple treasury. The words “since God will then demand it” refer to those offerings that are not volunteered but are required, such as sin offering for Shabbat violation and Passover sacrifices. Also, the words “God your Lord” themselves are not needed, since later on, it anyway says, “God will demand it.” Therefore, these words apply to regular charity and to tithes. Finally, “you will have committed a sin” is actually positive: only you are to blame, but not your animal – it does not become an invalid sacrifice just because you did not offer it on time.<br />

However, the charity has a unique aspect to it. Whereas a promised sacrifice needs to be brought before one, two, or more Holidays pass – depending upon <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/05/rosh-hashanah-3-five-points-of-view.html">which opinion you follow</a> – the obligation to give charity is immediate. One violates the "do not delay" prohibition by not paying. Why is that? Simply because the responsibility to bring a sacrifice is active only when there is a chance to do so, but poor people are found at all times. It is thus not related to any occasion or Festival.
<br />
<br />
What about an heir? Does he acquire the "do not delay" obligation from his parent to bring a sacrifice designated by his father? On the one hand, the Torah said "when you promise," and the heir did not make a promise. On the other hand, it also said, "you will bring," and perhaps this does include the heir. Rabbi Chiya offered an answer: "God will require it from you," - which means to tell us, "from you, but not from your heir." The heir thus does not acquire the parent's obligation.

Why? – Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1819">This month will be for you the first</a>... take a lamb for each household,” we know that the Exodus happened in the first month. But how do we know that it is Nisan? – Because the Torah also said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=16">Watch the month of the first ripened produce,</a>” and this must be the spring month of Nisan. But perhaps it is Iyar, which immediately follows Nisan and which you also have ripened produce? – No, it could not be Iyar because “the first ripened produce” grows before. Then say that it is Adar, which precedes Nisan? – Also, no, because we need the majority of “the first ripened produce.” So your proof is based on that? – But did the Torah say “the majority of the first ripened produce?” – No, it did not. Thus, this proof is abandoned, and the Talmud starts another.
<br />
<br />
The other proof also does not succeed, and we are forced to admit that there is nothing in the Torah that tells us that Nisan is indeed the first of months. Instead, we resort to the books of the Prophets and say this. Nisan was always known to be the first, but this knowledge was transmitted from teacher to student and not recorded anywhere in the Torah. Then came the Prophets and recorded it in conjunction with something else. For example, Ester was taken to King Achashverosh in the month of Tevet, which is called the tenth month. If so, then Nisan, which occurs nine months before, must be the first.
<br />
<br />
An extra month is added a year when needed - always before Nisan; money is taken for new sacrifices in Nisan, and some say that Nisan starts a year for house rentals.<br />

Rosh Hashanah 8 – When do animals give birth

The owner then stands at this opening and counts, marking every tenth one with red dye. The animals thus designated are brought as offerings in the Temple. Their meat is eaten by the owner and his guests in Jerusalem. We must therefore know when is the New Year for animal tithe.
<br />
<br />
There are two opinions: first of Elul, and thirty days later, first of Tishrei. Both are based on a phrase from the psalms, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2665.htm">The meadows (really, the ewes) are covered with flocks (really, by rams); the valleys are covered with corn, they shout and sing</a>.” The first teacher asks, “When do sheep become pregnant? – When valleys are covered with corn. And when is that? - In Adar. It turns out that the sheep give birth in Av, and their New Year is in Elul.” The second teacher gives a different answer: “When do sheep become pregnant? When the stalks of corn sing with a rustling sound. This is a month later, in Nisan, and therefore sheep give birth a month later, in Elul, and their New Year is in Tishrei.” However, the Talmud finds difficulty with this reading and goes on to the second explanation.<br />
<br />
Now all agree that animals give birth before Elul. Rather, the question is, do we compare the two tithes – animal and grain – and give them the same New Year, that is Tishrei? Or, do we compare them in that their New Year immediately follows the crop – and for animals that would be Elul.

Rosh Hashanah 9 – A Jubilee year
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

What day does it start on? - First of Tishrei, which thus becomes the New Year for the Jubilee. Jewish slaves must be set free; any land bought in the last 49 years goes back to its ancestral owners; this is also a Shmita year when nobody works the land. The sign of all of this is the blowing of the Shofar at the end of Yom Kippur. Therefore, for the ten days between the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, slaves cannot go home yet, but they are already not slaves. Instead, they eat and drink and sit with their crowns (or turbans, a sign of a free man), and their masters now serve them.
<br />
<br />
There is another opinion, however, that the Jubilee year starts after Yom Kippur, and not in any way before – which results in no feast for the slaves. It also results in the fact that the Jubilee year is the fiftieth year, following the Shmita, as opposed to coinciding with the last Shmita year. 
<br />
<br />
There is an idea of taking some time away from the regular minutes or days and adding it to the sanctified time. Some derive it from the laws of Shmita – which are extended both before and after the actual year. Others use Yom Kippur as a trendsetting example: since the Torah mentioned the affliction as starting on the ninth, the day before Yom Kippur, this teaches to add a little from the day before to the Yom Kippur itself. Others, however, say that overeating before Yom Kippur is considered an affliction and is thus a mitzvah.

This principle is called "we split the testimony".<br />

Cases of lashes are decided by three judges: "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-1.htm">And they (the judges) shall judge them</a>..." gives two judges as the minimal number of "they." Since a court with an even number of judges is not acceptable, one more judge is added. Rabbi Ishmael requires twenty-three judges, based on the use of the same word "evildoer" in "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">evildoer liable to lashes</a>..." and in "...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/35-31.htm">who is an evildoer to die</a>."<br />

One who reads "external books" may lose his share in the World to Come. Some say these are all books not related to the Torah, while others say they are only heretical. Writings such as Homer's are permitted.<br />
<br />
There is a similar disagreement about the Book of Ben Sira. Ben Sira was a son of the prophet Jeremiah. Rav Yosef quoted him, "A beautiful wife – fortunate is her husband, the number of his days is doubled" (or at least it seems to him so).<br />

Said Rabbi Eliezer, "Support me, and I will hear the words of Rabbi Akiva, my student. From where do you derive this opinion?"<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva derived it from a verse. "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_kings/21-1.htm%20">Menasheh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem... and he did evil in the eyes of God</a>." <br />
<br />
Now, Chizkiah, his father, taught Torah to the entire world. Of course, he taught his son Menasheh too. Nevertheless, with all the trouble that Chizkiah took with Menasheh to teach him the path of righteousness, in the end, it was sufferings that elevated Menasheh to proper conduct: "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">God brought upon the people the king of Assyria, and they captured Menasheh with hooks and transported him to Babylon. When Menasheh was in distress, he humbled himself greatly before the God of his father, and God returned him to Jerusalem</a>". <br />

<br />
The arrogance of Yarovam was the cause of his downfall, despite his initial greatness in Torah learning. As a king who was not a descendant of David, Yarovam would have to stand in the Temple Courtyard, while the king who was a true descendant would sit. Yarovam preferred to stop his subjects from pilgrimages to Jerusalem and established two golden calves for worship instead. Any time a punishment comes to the nation of Israel, it contains a small measure of the punishment for the first Golden Calf; after Yarovam, there were two more.<br />
<br />
Rav Ashi ended his lecture on the three kings with,"  "Tomorrow, we will continue with our colleague." Menasheh approached him in a dream and asked, "You call us colleagues? Which place on the bread do you bless?" Rav Ashi did not know. "The one that is baked first," - said Menasheh." "Then why did you worship idols?" - asked Rav Ashi." "If you were in our generation, you would run to worship them yourself," said Menasheh. In the morning, Rav Ashi started with, "Let us return to the three kings, our teacher."<br />

<br />
Of the things that the evil Jewish kings used to do, Menasheh scratched out the names of God from Torah scrolls and replaced them with different pagan deities; he also tore down the altar in the Temple; Amon burned the Torah and prohibited the bringing of sacrifices. Menasheh had relations with his sister, but Amon had relations with his mother; as it states, "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/33-23.htm">Amon did ever more evil</a>."

Furthermore, I know they have a penchant for linen garments they used to have in Egypt. Therefore, set tents and place harlots in them, an older one outside and a younger one inside."<br />
<br />
When the Jews would eat and drink and be merry and go out shopping, the older harlot would say to  them, "I have linen garments outside and even better and cheaper ones inside." After a few visits, the younger harlot would tell him, "You are like a family member. Choose from our merchandise for yourself, and have a glass of Ammonite wine (same as used by the daughters of Lot)." Once he drank, passion would burn in him, and he would say to her, "Yield yourself to me!" She would produce an idol from her bosom and tell him, "Worship this!" If he refused, she said, "All we ask is that you defecate in front of him." The Jew would do it, not knowing that this was the usual manner of worship.<br />
<br />Doeg's learning was so great that he knew all the cases of the added and deleted letters in the Torah, all the logic in the Torah, and three hundred laws about a tower that floats in the air. His downfall was his envy, which led him to malign King David.<br />

God told him, "I tested them, but you, I did not test." David said, "Test me!" God told him, "I will, and I will even tell you what the test will be - women." David then increased relations with his wife, and he forgot that it only increased desire. <br />
<br />
Bathsheba was shampooing her head underneath a canopy. Satan appeared to David in the form of a bird. David shot his arrow at it, and it struck and opened the canopy, exposing Bathsheba to view. David took her and then sent her back home. Technically, Bathsheba was divorced, but it looked like David sinned with a married woman. David said, "I could have withstood the test, but I did not want people to say that a student mastered his teacher (God)." David understood that his role in life was not of a Patriarch but of a penitent human. David then suffered for six months to expiate his sin.<br />

Shem answered that they indeed endured great distress. Depending on their habits, animals had to be fed by day or night, and Noah, with his sons, was always busy. There was a small bird resembling a quail called Zikita, and Noah did not know what it ate. Once he was standing eating a pomegranate, a worm fell out, and the bird ate it. After this, Noah would prepare bran until it became wormy and feed the worms to the bird.<br />
<br />
There was a bird named Chol (possibly Phoenix), which Noah found lying in its quarters in the Ark, not outside, waiting for food. He asked, "You don't want to eat?" The bird answered, "I saw how preoccupied you were, so I did not want to trouble you with feeding me." Touched, Noah said, "May it be God's will that you will never die!" and it was fulfilled in "<a href="http://bible.cc/job/29-18.htm">I shall die with my nest intact and live for many days like chol</a>."<br />

Since twelve lunar months are less than a solar year by eleven days, and since Passover has to be in spring, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Guard the month of young grain to celebrate Passover</a>..." an extra month is sometimes inserted. The judges deciding when to insert a month must be appointed the day before the discussion.<br />
<br />
It once happened that Rabban Gamliel invited seven judges, but eight assembled. Rabban Gamliel then said, "He who was not invited should exit," on which Shmuel the Minor, who was, in fact, the greatest of them, exited, taking the blame on himself and sparing the humiliation of the uninvited one. <br />

“<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/26-11.htm%20">The sons of Korach did not die</a>” means that a place was set for them in Gehinnom, where they sat and recited God's praise for their salvation. Rabbah bar bar Chanah tells the following story:<br />
<br />
I was one walking on the road, and an Arab merchant told me, “Come, and I will show you the site of the swallowing of Korach's assembly.” He then went and showed two cracks in the ground which smoked. He took a ball of wool shearings, soaked it in water, put it on the head of a spear, and passed the spear over the cracks, and the wool was singed. Then the Arab told him to listen, and he heard, “Moses and his Torah are true, and they (we) are liars”<br />

Rabbi Eliezer, however, says that the phrase “as this very day”  implies that just as the day darkens and then becomes light, so too the Ten Tribes, for whom it is dark, will likewise one day have light. Said Rabbi Yochanan, “Rabbi Akiva has abandoned his usual generosity of spirit.”<br />

Isaiah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/5-14.htm">Therefore Sheol (another name for Gehinnom) has expanded her desire and opened wide her mouth without measure.</a>” Resh Lakish explained “without measure” as saying that whoever leaves even a single law unfulfilled is condemned to punishment in Gehinnom. Rabbi Yochanan said to him, “God, the Master, is not pleased with you saying such things about his subjects.” Rather, if one learned no more than a single law, he will be spared the punishment of Sheol.<br />

However, there are many preconditions. The subverters have to be men from this city and not their agents. People have to be subverted and not decide to worship idols on their own. Each person needs to receive a warning with two witnesses. A caravan lodging in the city, if it is not subverted, saves the city.<br />
<br />
The property of the subverted city's residents is destroyed by burning, even that of the righteous ones – for they should not have resided with such neighbors.<br />

However, Rabbi Eliezer says that they should have been burned together with other property, and since this is not allowed,  any city that has at least one mezuzah cannot be judged as a subverted city.<br />
<br />
Yehoshua said, "<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/6-26.htm%20">Cursed be the man before Hashem, who rises up and builds this city, Jericho.&nbsp;</a>He will lay its foundation with his oldest son<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="" target="_blank">, and with his youngest son, he will set up its gates</a>.”</span>&nbsp;Chiel, a close friend of King Ahab, rebuilt the city, and the curse was fulfilled in him. Elijah came to console him, and Ahab asked if he thought the curse of Joshua was the cause. Elijah confirmed. Then Ahab said that Moses had cursed everybody who worshiped idols with drought and established an idol on every hill, but in Israel, there was an abundance of rain.<br />
<br />
Elijah immediately decreed a drought, and God granted it to him. Elijah had to run away to the desert, where ravens brought him bread and meat, and he drank from a brook. Eventually, the brook dried out, and Elijah was commanded to go live in Tsarfat. When the son of his hostess died, Elijah wanted to revive him, but God said, “I have three keys – from childbirth, rain, and resurrection. It is not proper for Me to have one, and for you – two. Elijah had to give up the key to rain, and the drought ended.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose called Elijah an irascible person. Elijah hid from him for three days. When Elijah came, Rabbi Yose asked, “Why were you hiding?” Elijah answered, “You called me irascible!” Rabbi Yose said, “So you are irascible again!”<br />

Additionally, the sheep and goats may be too young by Passover, or the doves may be too tender.<br />
<br />The extra month of the leap year is always inserted before the month of Passover; thus, it becomes the Second month of Adar, when Purim is celebrated.<br />
<br />
However, a leap year is never proclaimed before Rosh HaShanah, for if it were, people might forget about it by the time the Second Adar comes six months later. Then, they might mistakenly celebrate Passover on the Second Adar and consequently transgress the prohibition of eating leavened bread during actual Passover.<br />

This is called Semichah, and three Sages are required for that. <br />
<br />
Semichah can also mean Rabbinical ordination in an unbroken chain since Moses. Once the Romans enacted that anyone who confers ordination is killed, anyone who accepts ordination is killed, and the nearest town is destroyed. Yehudah ben Bava placed himself between two mountains and ordained five Sages there. When the enemies discovered them, he told his students, "My sons, run! I will be like a rock that cannot be turned." The soldiers drove three hundred spears through him and made him like a sieve. Three Sages are required for ordination, but Yehudah ben Bava alone is mentioned because of his importance.<br />

The city nearest to where the body was found has to take a calf that was never worked and bring it to a valley of unworked ground, <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">where it is decapitated</a>. <br />
<br />
Measuring which town is nearest has to be carried out by three judges, members of the Great Sanhedrin. The decapitation of the calf is then performed by the court of the town that is nearest.<br />
<br />
However, the members of the Sanhedrin do not generally leave the Chamber of Hewn Stones in the Temple since "<a href="http://bible.cc/songs/7-2.htm">Your navel is like a moon-shaped basin; let not the strength of the blend diminish</a>." is allegorically referring to</span><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;the members of the Sanhedrin, who sat in a semicircle.<br />

If one wants to redeem it for money and its value is unknown, three people must estimate it. Three merchant appraisers are required for this and can even be partners.<br />
<br />
Items consecrated to the Temple need three appraisers to be redeemed; consecrated lands need nine appraisers and a Kohen.<br />
<br />
All cases of capital crimes require the Small Sanhedrin of twenty-three judges. If an animal is involved, like in the cases of sodomy, or when an animal kills a human, the animal is judged by the court of twenty-three, similar to human cases.<br />

Moses selected six judges from each of the twelve tribes. Then, he used lottery tickets that either said “Sage” or were empty. However, Eldad and Meidad remained in the camp because they thought themselves unworthy (alternatively, they were afraid not to be selected). Instead, they were granted prophesy.<br />
<br />
The members of the Sanhedrin must be men of height, wisdom, moderate old age, acquainted with witchcraft, and who know seventy languages so that they hear the testimony directly and not through an interpreter.

Add to this charity collectors, a doctor, a butcher, and a teacher of children.<br />
<br />
The High Priest may judge and be judged. But that is obvious!? You might think that if the High Priest kills inadvertently, he does not go into exile since accidental killers return from their exile upon the death of the High Priest, and he himself cannot thus benefit. Therefore, the rule says that he is judged nevertheless.<br />

This applies to later kings, but kings of the Davidic line may judge and, therefore, be judged; as Resh Lakish explained, "First correct yourself, and then correct others"— only a person subject to correction may correct others.<br />
<br />
But why may the other kings not judge or be judged? Because of an incident that once occurred. A slave of King Yannai killed a person, and Shimon ben Shetach called King Yannai to court - because "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-29.htm">its owner had been warned by witnesses</a>" that the king, the owner of the slave, had to be in court. Yannai came and sat down. Shimon ben Shetach told him to stand up, but the king said, "I will do as your colleagues will say." All the members of the Sanhedrin were looking into the ground. Shimon ben Shetach said, "You are men of deep thought! May the Master of thoughts exact retribution from you!" -" and they died. The Sages then decreed that a king may neither judge nor be judged.<br />

Such cases are judged by the courts of three qualified judges. Judges act based on the testimony given by two qualified witnesses. There is no concept of a jury and, in general, no concept of circumstantial evidence.<br />
<br />
Cases of robbery and bodily injury are also monetary cases, adjudicated by courts of three qualified judges. Qualified in this context means that besides knowing relevant Torah law and scientific discovery, they must also possess "semicha," an uninterrupted chain of ordination going back to Moses.<br />
<br />
However, loan cases can be adjudicated even by judges without semicha. This was an additional enactment made to " not close doors for the would-be borrowers" so lenders would find it easy to resolve loan questions and wouldn't always require ordained judges in loan disputes.<br />

The king may, however, have concubines. Tamar was David's daughter from a beautiful concubine captured in war. Amnon violated her and "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/13-15.htm">hated her with a very great hatred</a>." Why?

But Jewish women were renowned for not having pubic hair!? - Tamar was different.<br />
<br />
"<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">The king may not multiply horses</a>..." - only enough for his chariots. "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">And silver and gold he shall not accumulate overmuch</a>" – only enough to pay his soldiers' wages.<br />

No one may ride on the king's horse, no one may sit on his throne, and no one may use his scepter. No one may observe the king when he is getting a haircut (every day), when he is undressed, or when he is in the bathhouse, following "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">You shall surely place upon yourself a king</a>" - the awe of the king must be upon you.<br />

Nobody but another king can marry a king's wife. Thus, Avishag, whom David never married, was permitted only to Solomon. Why did David not marry Avishag? Because for that he would have to divorce one of his eighteen wives, and divorce is harsh.

This includes cases of disputed loans, theft, bodily injury, and monetary damage. <br />
<br />
If the defendant is unwilling to come to trial, any court of three can impose its authority. Moreover, if the defendant resides in a city with an established official court, he cannot choose a new court for judgment. However, if he is willing to be judged but does not agree to the suggested court because it is either too far or is not qualified, they can use the following procedure:<br />
<br />Rabbi Meir says that one litigant selects a judge, the other selects a judge, and both litigants select one more judge. However, the Sages say, "The two judges selected by the litigants select a third one." The judge chosen by each litigant will ensure that his position is clearly represented.<br />

However, if both litigants agree to accept their verdict, they can even preside at a trial.<br />
<br />
If a litigant declared to his opponent, "My father is acceptable to me to act as a judge," or "Your father is acceptable to me to act as a judge," or "Three cattle herders are acceptable to me to act as judges," but afterward changes his mind and wants to retract, then Rabbi Meir says that indeed he may retract. Still, the Sages say that he may not.<br />
<br />
If he wants to retract before the verdict is reached, all agree that he may. The argument is only after the verdict is reached, and the law in this case follows the Sages – that he may not retract.<br />

Sanhedrin 25 – Those Ineligible to be Judges or Witnesses

Rabbi Yehudah says, "When are the dice-players ineligible to adjudicate or testify? When they have no trade but this, but if they also have another trade, they are eligible."<br />
<br />
Those who put personal gain above the law are suspected of accepting bribes, but what is the problem with gamblers? Rabbi Yehudah supposes that if all he does is gamble, he is not knowledgeable in the law or the ways of commerce. Therefore, if he has another trade, he is eligible. The first Sage considers gambling a form of theft: his customers don't really expect to lose, so when the gambler collects his wins, he is a robber.<br />

Initially, both </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Shmita </span><span style="font-size: medium;">gatherers and traders were disqualified from serving as witnesses. However, when the ruling power began to collect tax in the seventh year, Rabbi Yannai allowed to plant on Shmita, since Shmita today is only a decree of the Sages. After this,s only merchants remained disqualified.<br />
<br />
Once, during Shmita Resh, Lakish joined Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Shimon to observe the procedure for calculating a leap year. He saw a man plowing and said, "This man is a Kohen, and he is plowing." (Kohanim were especially suspect.) They answered, "He might say that he is just a worker." He then saw a man pruning and said, "Kohen is pruning." They answered, "He may say that he needs the branches."<br />
<br />
They said, "This fellow is argumentative." When they reached the meeting place, they ascended and pulled the ladder up to prevent him from joining.<br />

Sanhedrin 27 – Disqualified Witness

<span style="font-size: medium;">Witnesses can be refuted and become false witnesses in the following way: a second set of witnesses comes and testifies that the first witnesses could not have possibly seen the incident to which they testified, since they were with them (the second set) in a different place at that very time. Refuted false witnesses get the same punishment as what they wanted to inflict on the one about whom they testified.<br />
<br />
If witnesses testified in January but were later exposed as false witnesses in July, then what happens to their unrelated testimony given in March?&nbsp;Abaye says that they are disqualified retroactively since <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/23-1.htm">they are evildoers</a>. Rava says that the law of false witnesses is such a novelty that it cannot be analyzed logically; they are false only from now on, and their March testimony is unaffected.<br />

<br />
If a witness eats non-kosher meat because it is cheaper, he cannot testify because he can be bribed. What if he eats it to make a point? Abaye says that he is an evildoer, thus, disqualified. Rava says that for disqualification, he needs to be an evildoer in money matters, not ritual.</span><br />

Relatives include one's brother, uncle, sister's husband, aunt's husband, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and sons and sons-in-law.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah says, "One's close friend and one's enemy are also disqualified." However, the Sages say that Jewish people are not suspected of bearing false witness about someone because of love or animosity.<br />
<br />
How does one understand "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Fathers shall not be put to death because of their sons nor shall sons be put to death because of their fathers</a>..."? We already know that "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">each man shall be put to death only because of his own sin</a>." Therefore, we have to understand that "Fathers shall not be put to death because of the testimony of their sons."<br />

Then they send out everyone but the most prominent witness and the litigants and ask, "Tell us how do you know that this one owes money to that one." <br />
<br />
If he says, "He told me, 'I owe him,'" or says, "So-and-so told me that he owes him," - it is as if he said nothing. Only direct observations are admissible, such as a loan taking place, whereas his statements constitute hearsay. However, it is acceptable if he says that the defendant appointed them as witnesses and then admitted his debt to the plaintiff. Then, they bring in the second witness. The testimonies should correspond.<br />
<br />
The ruling of the majority of judges is accepted, but if one says, "I don't know," they add two more judges at a time. After the verdict is announced, the judges cannot reveal individual opinions because "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/19-16.htm">Do not be a gossipmonger</a>..." <br />

However, because of the concern that a solitary judge might be chosen from commoners who are not knowledgeable in monetary law, the Sages decreed that three judges are necessary even in loan cases. <br />
<br />
But could three judges not be all commoners, not knowledgeable in monetary law? - No, at least one of them will have picked some knowledge. If so, they should not be liable for errors, like professional judges? If they were exempt, there would be even more ignorant corner dwellers.<br />
<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the verse "...<a href="#" target="_blank">the master of the house shall approach a judge</a>..." the word "judge: is mentioned three times, so three judges are needed.</span>&nbsp;However, Rebbi says that five judges are required to start, so that at least three reach the same conclusion.<br />

However, the losing litigant is entitled to a written verdict record. Rabbi Yochanan says that the verdict reads, "He is not liable," and individual opinions of the judges are not recorded because of "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/19-16.htm">Do not be a gossipmonger</a>..." Resh Lakish holds that the names of the judges are recorded with their opinions of "liable" or "not liable" because otherwise, the verdict appears to be a lie. Rabbi Elazar finds a compromise: "Through their words, so-and-so was found not liable," implying that the verdict was not unanimous.<br />
<br />
The testimonies of the two witnesses are not combined unless they witness the event together. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah says that even if they witness two separate events that occur one after another, their testimonies may be combined. The first teacher maintains that one testimony's maneh (100 shekels) is not the maneh of the other. But Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah says that they testify about a maneh in general.<br />

Even after the verdict has been issued, a litigant can nullify the verdict when he brings evidence to support his claim.<br />
<br />
If the judges found it necessary to impose a time limit and told the litigant, after issuing a verdict against him, "All evidence that you may have to support your claim, you must produce within the next thirty days," then the rule is: if the litigant finds evidence within thirty days, he can nullify the verdict, but if he finds it after thirty days, he cannot nullify the verdict.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "What should this person do? Rather, he may present the evidence even after thirty days." The law follows Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.<br />

If a litigant saw that he was about to be found liable and then produced witnesses, he is not believed because it is a desperate attempt to win the case.<br />

Inquiry refers to time and place, questioning to the particulars of the testimony. That the court proceedings should be uniform is required by "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-22.htm">There shall be one law for you</a>."<br />
<br />However, in the cases of loans, the Sages waived this requirement in order to make it easier for the borrowers to obtain funds. How could the Sages abrogate a Torah law? They utilized the power that the Torah gives to the court, allowing it to confiscate property and then award it to the winner without complete interrogation. If the court sees a possibility of fraud, the questioning is required. <br />
<br />In general, one should try to take his case to the court of more prominent Sages because in doing so, he will learn additional Torah laws.<br />

This is true whether the verdict declared the defendant liable or not liable. However, in capital cases, a verdict handed down in favor of the accused may not be reversed. <br />
<br />
What kind of error in judgment is reversible? A clear mistake in any Mishnah or a mistake in any ruling in the Talmud is considered a mistake on the part of the judge, and his ruling based on this can be reversed. What kind of error is not reversible? A matter disagreed upon in the Mishnah, then still disagreed in the Talmud, and currently having a clear consensus of the majority of the judges. If our judge ruled against this consensus, his ruling stands and is not reversible, even though it is considered a "mistake in the weighing of opinions."<br />

Sanhedrin 34 – Who Can Advance Arguments Pro and Con?

In capital cases, however, anyone may advance arguments for acquittal – even the students who are sitting in court to learn the law – but only the judges may advance arguments for conviction.<br />
<br />
In capital cases, one who advanced an argument for conviction may argue for acquittal, but one who advanced an argument for acquittal may not argue for conviction. He needs to keep thinking through his acquittal arguments till the end. In the final vote, however, he may decide on conviction.<br />
<br />
Multiple laws may be derived from one verse, but multiple verses may not be used by the same Sage to derive the same law. Therefore, if two Sages in court  bring the same argument citing different verses, it counts as only one vote.<br />

However, capital cases may be concluded on the same day for acquittal but only on the following day for conviction. The judges go home at night and consider the matter further, trying to find more reasons for acquittal. <br />
<br />
Because of that, capital cases may not be tried on Friday. If the verdict is for conviction, the man has to be executed on Saturday, and that is not possible. Waiting with the execution is not allowed so as not to prolong the agony. Concluding the judgment on Sunday is also not possible because the judges may forget the arguments. And even though scribes write down their arguments, they don't write down their thoughts.<br />

Two judicial scribes stand before them, one to the right and one to the left, and they would record the words of those arguing for conviction and the words of those arguing for acquittal. Both scribes record all words so that if one errs, he can be corrected from the other scribe's notes.<br />
<br />
Three rows of disciples of the sages would sit before them so that if the presiding judges were deadlocked, more judges could be added from these disciples. The disciples sit in the order of eminence. If the judges needed to ordain someone, they would ordain one of the disciples from the first row. One disciple from the second row would move to the first, one from the third would move to the second, and one more person from the scholarly community would be put in the third row.<br />

Perhaps you do not realize we will eventually examine you with inquiries and questions. Know that capital cases are not like monetary cases: in monetary cases, a person may pay back the money he unjustly caused someone to lose and receive atonement, but in capital cases, the blood of the accused and the blood of his descendants are the witness' responsibility until eternity."<br />
<br />Therefore, the first man was created alone.&nbsp;Also, everyone should say, "For my sake, the world was created," - and he should be careful not to bring about his downfall by committing a transgression. Now, perhaps you will say, "What need have we for all this trouble?" - <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">If you were a witness and saw the event, you must testify</a>.&nbsp;  And perhaps you will say, "What need have we to incur responsibility for this man's blood?" - be secure, for "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/11-10.htm">when the wicked perish, there is joy</a>."<br />

Said Rabbi Yochanan, "That is only concerning a pagan heretic, but as for a Jewish heretic, do not debate him, for he will become even more heretical."<br />
<br />
Continued Rabbi Yochanan, "Wherever the heretics have used a verse in Scripture as support for their arguments, the rebuttal can be found in a nearby verse." For example, it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-26.htm">Let us (plural) make man in our (plural) image</a>..." But the next verse says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-27.htm">God created man in His image</a>." Then why is the plural form used at all? To show that The Holy One, Blessed is He, never does anything unless He first consults with the Heavenly Court.<br />

Two more judges are mentioned below, and since the court needs an odd number of judges to rule by majority, the total is five.<br />
<br />
The Sages, however, say that since the word "condemn" ירשיען is written defectively, without the usual letter vav ירשיעון that one would expect for plural, it means one judge. Therefore, their count is three judges.<br />
<br />
The basic argument here is whether the pronounced form of the word (Rabbi Yehudah) or its written form (Sages) is more important. Other arguments hinging on the same "written or pronounced" premise include the number of blood applications of a sacrifice needed for atonement, the number of walls in a sukkah, and the amount of blood from two corpses that creates ritual impurity.<br />

The primary purpose of these questions is to pinpoint the time and place and allow the possibility of making them <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">disqualified (false) witnesses</a>. In fact, if there is no possibility for the witnesses to be disqualified, their testimony is not accepted.<br />
<br />
Then they would ask specific questions: "Did you recognize the victim?” and “Did you warn the accused?” In cases of idol worship, they asked, “What idol did he worship, and how did he worship it?” Whoever increases the number of supplementary questions is praiseworthy. It once happened that Ben Zakkai examined the witnesses concerning the stems of the figs on the fig tree under which the murder allegedly occurred.<br />

<br />
"Did he kill within as much time as needed to say a greeting of peace to one's teacher?" - If he commits the offense after this period has elapsed, he avoids punishment since, perhaps in the interim, he has forgotten the warning.<br />

<br />
While the condemned is being escorted to the execution grounds, one man stands at the courthouse door with a flag in his hand, and another sits astride a horse at a distance. If someone says, “I have grounds to argue for his acquittal,” the flagman waves the flags, and the horse with its rider races to the execution party and halts it. Even if the condemned himself says, “I have grounds for my own acquittal,” they return him to the courthouse to hear his arguments, even four or five times, as long as there is substance to his words.<br />

Joshua then said, "Master of the Universe, who is the individual who has sinned?" God replied, "Am I your talebearer? Go cast lots!"<br />
<br />
The lot fell on Achan. Achan, however, told Joshua, "A lot is no proof! It had to fall on somebody." "Please," begged Joshua, "acknowledge your guilt, and you will be spared. In the future, Israel is to be divided by casting lots. Please don't cast aspersions on it now." Achan confessed and was executed.<br />
<br />
Joshua then hurled the booty in front of God and told him, "Because of this transgression, the great person, Yair ben Menasheh, who is comparable to the greater part of the Sanhedrin, had to die?" God told Joshua, "Your transgression is even worse. At night, when not fighting, you should not have neglected the Torah study." The next night, Joshua corrected this.<br />

A woman remains also covered from the back – so says Rabbi Yehudah, but the Sages maintain that a woman is not stoned naked; rather, she is dressed in a single plain garment.<br />
<br />
The elevation of the stoning grounds was twice a man's height. One of the witnesses pushes the condemned man by his hips so that he falls on the side. If he dies from this fall, the court has fulfilled its obligation. If not, the second witness picks up a stone and casts it upon his chest. If he dies from this, it is sufficient; if not, all present throw rocks at him.<br />

<br />
A man is hung facing the people, and a woman is hung facing the gallows – these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer, but the Sages say, "Only a man is hung; a woman is not hung at all."<br />
<br />
How do they hang a man? They sink a post vertically into the ground, and a beam protrudes from it. The hangman brings together two hands of the corpse, one upon the other, and hangs him by his hands from the beam. Rabbi Yose says, "The post is leaned on an angle against the wall, and he hangs him in the way that butchers do""<br />
<br />
After he is hung, they untie him immediately, remove him from the gallows, and bury him.<br />

When would it make a difference? When one declares that after he dies, he does not wish his corpse to be buried. If burial is because of the disgrace to his family, he cannot refuse burial and thus disgrace his family. If it is because of his own atonement – he has clearly stated that he does not want atonement, and there would be no reason to bury him.<br />
<br />
The Talmud does not resolve this question, but the prevailing practice is that if one does not wish to be buried, his wishes are disregarded.<br />
<br />
Is eulogy delivered for the honor of the living, that is, the relatives who survive the deceased, or is it for the honor of the dead? Since the deceased receives atonement through various disgraces if they befall his corpse, it follows that a eulogy is for the honor of the dead person himself.<br />

When does this prohibition go into effect? Abaye says that the prohibition applies from the moment the item is designated to serve the needs of the corpse, but Rava maintains that it starts from the time that item is actually used in its new capacity. <br />
<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Abaye derives his view by comparison with&nbsp;<a href="#" target="_blank">the decapitated heifer</a>: just as the heifer becomes forbidden when it is led into a rocky, uncultivated valley, so too all designated items are already viewed as if serving their purpose.</span>&nbsp;However, Rava compares this with accessories to idolatry, which do not become forbidden through mere designation. What is Rava's reason? - We should derive accessory (for the corpse) from accessory (for idol worship), and not compare to heifer, which is the item in question itself.<br />

In descending order of severity, these are stoning, burning, beheading, and strangulation. <br />
<br />
What difference does the severity of the execution make? In a situation where one has committed several capital offenses, each of which renders him liable to a different type of execution – since one cannot be executed more than once - he receives the more severe execution for which he is liable. Rabbi Shimon lists them in a different order: burning, stoning, strangulation, and beheading.<br />

If, in addition, he has received authorization to judge from a government authority (The Babylonian Exilarch in the time of the Talmud), then the judge is free from liability if he rules erroneously.<br />
<br />
It is thus understandable why one needs permission to judge monetary cases. But why does he need it when judging the cases of ritual, provided that he is knowledgeable?  Because of a story that happened when one student allowed to make ritually pure dough with egg yolk (מי ביצים, mei beitsim), and the people understood him as saying marsh water (מי בצעים, mei betsaim). After this, it was instituted that one may not render decisions before he gets permission from his teacher, who will ascertain that he has clear diction and that his rulings will be understood properly.<br />

And what is the particular strictness of their transgression? - They attack the fundamentals.<br />
<br />
Stoning is more severe than beheading, as can be derived from the law of the subverted city. If most of the residents of a town in the Land of Israel followed the instigation of evil men and worshiped idols, then the residents guilty of idolatry are beheaded, but the subverters themselves are stoned. Since the subverters' transgression is greater, stoning is more severe than beheading.<br />
<br />
Perhaps strangulation is just as severe as stoning, since it is administered to one who strikes his father or mother, and the honor of parents is compared to the honor of God? - No, stoning is more severe since it is applied to an adulterous betrothed girl, whereas for adultery with a fully married adulterous woman, one only receives strangulation.<br />

Said Rabbi Eliezer in explanation of this, "With her father by burning; with her father-in-law by stoning."<br />
<br />
Suppose a daughter of a Kohen who is either betrothed or fully married commits adultery. In that case, her punishment is correspondingly more significant than that of her lover, who is punished by strangulation. But what is the meaning of Rabbi Eliezer's cryptic statement? If he meant that she commits adultery with either her father or her father-in-law, then his ruling is correct even for a daughter of Yisrael, and he did not have to state it. Instead, "with her father" means "in the domain of her father," that is, betrothed, and "with her father-in-law" means "in the domain of her father-in-law," that is, fully married.<br />
<br />
There were other explanations, but Rav Nachman said, "The law is like the first explanation." Said Rav Yosef, "The law?!? There are no capital punishments today!" Said Abaye, "Should we not learn the laws of sacrifices because they are not relevant today? We do learn them and receive a reward for learning!" And Rav Yosef meant that when the Messiah comes and resurrects the dead, we will ask Rabbi Eliezer himself.<br />

The lead descends into his stomach and burns his intestines.<br />

This procedure is for those who are beheaded: they would decapitate him with the sword, cutting off his head from the front. Said Rabbi Yehudah, "It is a disgrace for him since the Roman government does the same. Rather, they chop it off with an ax." Answered the Sages, "That would be even more disgraceful."<br />

Another explanation is so that it should not occur that an animal passes in the street, and people say, "This is the one that caused So-and-so to be stoned."<br />
<br />
But how do we know that the punishment is indeed stoning? This is derived from the use of the same words, "You shall surely kill him," concerning this man and concerning one who instigates others to idolatry, about whom it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">You shall pelt him with stones</a>."<br />

Rav Achadboi bar Ami asked Rav Sheshet, "If one copulates with himself, what is the law?" In other words, if one bends his organ underneath himself until it touches his orifice, is he liable for sodomy? Rav Sheshet answered him, "You upset us with impossible questions!"<br />
<br />
In discussing this, Rav Ashi said to Ravina, "What point is in question to you?" You should be able to resolve the inquiry on your own, as follows. In a state of erection, you cannot find such a case. Therefore, you can only find such a case when the organ is limp. According to the view which says that one is not liable when he copulates with a woman forbidden to him by using a limp organ - here, too, he is not liable. On the view that one IS liable for such copulation in the case of a forbidden woman, here, too, he is obviously liable to two sin offerings: one for committing the copulative act and one for submitting to the copulative act.<br />

The act of blasphemy is always referred to in the Talmud by the euphemism "blessing." The blasphemer is not liable unless he pronounces the Divine Name, yud, keh, vav, keh. In referring to the Tetragrammaton name of God, it is accepted practice to modify the spelling and to pronounce the letter "heh" as "keh."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah describes the trial procedure. Whenever the judges examine the witnesses, they use a pseudonym, asking the witnesses, for example, whether the accused said, "May Yose strike Yose." However, when the case is completed, they may not execute the offender based on a pseudonym. Rather, they send everyone out of the courtroom and then ask the most eminent of the witnesses, "State explicitly what you heard the blasphemer say," and he says it. Upon hearing the blasphemy, the judges stand up and rend their garments, and never repair them. The second witness then says, "I, too, have heard as he did." There is no need for him to repeat the exact words.<br />

For the violation of three transgressions, a Noahide may be executed: for sexual transgressions, murder, and "blessing” the Divine Name. Some add idolatry to this list, and some say that for violation of any of the seven Noahide laws, a Noahite is executed.<br />
<br />A Noahite is executed by one judge based on the testimony of one witness, even though he violated the prohibition without having received prior warning. A man who judges or testifies can even be a relative of the accused.<br />

<br />
A Noahite is permitted to marry his daughter. You may ask why Adam did not marry his daughter? He did it so that Cain could marry his sister, based on "The world will be built through kindness" in Psalms. A Noahite is also permitted to marry his sister. Didn't we just say that "The world will be built through kindness" allowed Cain to marry his sister, but otherwise, it would be prohibited?! True, but once it was permitted to Cain, it remained permitted.<br />

Why was he then expressly prohibited a limb torn from a living animal? - Adam was allowed to eat an animal that died of itself.<br />

Furthermore, in settlement, the would-be winner is robbed of some money.<br />

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha </span><span style="font-size: medium;">says</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> on the contrary that before the verdict, it is a meritorious deed for a judge to arbitrate a compromise - "...<a href="http://bible.cc/zechariah/8-16.htm">execute truth and judgment of peace</a>...", and "judgment of peace" means compromise - like King David, who "...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/8-15.htm">rendered judgment and righteousness</a>..."

However, if one embraces, kisses, sweeps, sprinkles water, washes, anoints, clothes, or shoes  an idol, he merely transgresses a negative commandment. If one vows in the name of an idol or swears in its name, one transgresses a negative commandment. Defecating to Baal Pe'or and throwing a stone at Markulis (Mercury) is a standard service for these idols.<br />

Rabbah met him and asked a question: we have learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/04/sanhedrin-60-idol-worship-liability.html">one who serves an idol is subject to stoning</a>. This implies that one has to actually serve the idol to be liable. But in regard to a subverted city, we have learned that if one says, “I will serve,” or “I will go and serve,” or “Let us go and serve” a certain idol, he is already liable. So is action required or is professed intention sufficient?<br />
<br />
Rav Hamnuna replied, “In the first case he does not accept the idol as deity until he serves it. In the second case, however, his statement implies that he accepts the idol as his deity as of now – and he will shortly serve it. Thus, he is liable for something else - for accepting the idol as a deity” - precisely <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/04/sanhedrin-60-idol-worship-liability.html">as we have learned</a>.</span><br />

Rabbi Yochanan told him, "Leave my study hall and teach this ruling outside; it is incorrect."<br />
<br />
What was their disagreement? Rabbi Zakkai compared the rules of idol worship to the rules of the Sabbath. About Sabbath, it says, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=35%20">Do not ignite any fire, no matter where you live</a>." Since all manner of work is already prohibited, this extra commandment teaches how to treat multiple violations – according to some, as separate transgressions and, according to others, as one single transgression. Rabbi Zakkai followed the "single transgression" rule. However, Rabbi Yochanan held that the laws of idol worship are not comparable to the laws of the Sabbath in this respect.<br />

The word "brought" is in the plural, as indicated by an extra letter vav. This means that the Jews continued to recognize the divinity of God but paired Him with another entity. Had they said "brought" in singular, those who do evil to Israel (euphemism for the Jews themselves) would have been subject to extermination – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir.<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Shimon says that whoever worships the One in Heaven by pairing the name with something else is torn from the world, for it is stated "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-20.htm">only to God alone</a>."

However, after they became attached to it, they longed for it like one longs for his son.<br />
<br />
Elijah the Righteous would seek out those bloated from hunger in Jerusalem during the time of the first destruction. He found a child, bloated, in a heap of trash. The child was the last from a large family. Elijah asked, "If I teach you something by which you will merit to live, will you learn it?" The child replied, "Yes." Elijah told him, "Say, every day, Hear, O Israel, God our Lord, God is One." The child said, "Be silent; do not mention the name of God, which my father and mother had not taught." He then brought out the statue of his deity from his bosom, embraced it, and kissed it until his abdomen burst. He fell on his deity to fulfill, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/26-30.htm%20">I will cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols</a>."<br />
<br />
During the Second Temple, the Sages prayed and fasted for three days to eliminate the power of the Evil Urge for idol worship. It appeared as a fiery lion cub out of the Holy of Holies. They threw it into a lead cauldron and covered it with lead. They then tied the Evil Urge for immorality for three days but could not even find a fresh egg when they needed it. Since they could not eliminate the urge for only the prohibited, they at least removed the desire for relatives, like one's mother and sister.<br />

Sanhedrin 65 – Molech, Ov, Yidoni

The child would remain alive, being either passed between two walls of fire, or the parent would jump with him over a fiery pit. There were other forms of worship, though, where the child was actually burned.<br />
<br />
A practitioner of Ov is a necromancer  - one who communicates with the dead – by raising the spirit of the deceased from the ground and causing it to take up residence under his armpits, from where its voice emanates. A practitioner of Yidoni takes a bone of the animal known as Yadua and places it in his mouth, from where a voice emanates. These are both liable to stoning, and one who inquires of them violates a negative commandment.<br />

One who cohabits with a young maiden is not <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">liable to be stoned</a>&nbsp;unless she is young (naarah), a virgin, betrothed, and still in her father's house. A naarah is a twelve-year-old girl who has sprouted two pubic hairs; she remains a naarah until she is twelve and a half. Virgin – but if she had intimate relations, their punishment is standard - strangulation. Betrothed – the first stage of marriage (kiddushin) has been performed, but there was no huppah, so she is yet not allowed to live with her husband. If two men cohabited with her anally, the first one is liable to stoning, and the second one – to strangulation.<br />

Thus it eats. Thus it drinks. Thus it benefits. Thus it harms."<br />
<br />
If he says his words to two persons, they are his witnesses, even without a warning, and they bring him to court and stone him. If he says his remarks to one person, that person can entrap him, saying, "I have more friends who are interested." If the instigator is clever and refuses, they arrange witnesses behind a partition, and he asks the instigator to repeat his words in private. He then says, "How can we forget our God in Heaven and worship wood and stones?" If the instigator retracts, this is good; if not, the witnesses behind the partition take him to court.<br />
<br />
A person named Yannai asked for a drink at a certain inn. He saw that the waitress's lips were moving and understood that she was engaged in sorcery. He poured off some liquid, and it turned into scorpions. He gave the waitress to drink and she became a donkey. He rode upon her and went out to the marketplace. Her friend came and dissolved the magic spell, and Yannai was thus seen riding upon a woman in the marketplace.<br />

How was he allowed to practice witchcraft if it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">You shall not learn to do it</a>?"– Because you can learn to understand and teach.<br />
<br />
However, that was the only piece of knowledge that Rabbi Akiba learned from him after Rabbi Eliezer was excommunicated for not following the law accepted by the majority. When Rabbi Eliezer was dying, he predicted that the Sages who did not realize their full learning potential because of not learning from him would die a martyr's death, and it came true.<br />
<br />
A wayward and rebellious son is a boy who commits certain sins associated with theft and gluttony. If his parents admonish him and he ignores their warnings, he is flogged in court. If he still persists in his behavior, he is put to death through stoning.<br />

This refers to the lower beard (pubic hair) and not the upper (facial) beard, but the Sages prefer to use clean language. Additionally, he cannot be older than thirteen and three months, so in most cases, this age starts at thirteen and ends at thirteen and three months.<br />
<br />
A man can be declared a wayward and rebellious son, but not a daughter because men are more given to base desires. <br />

He incurs liability if he eats a large measure of meat, called tarteimar (about 1.5 pounds), and drinks half a log (volume of three eggs) of Italian wine, which is habit-forming. Rabbi Yossi doubles these measures. <br />
<br />He must buy that meat with the money stolen from his father, and he should be a repeat offender with prior warning and flogging.<br />
<br />
If he ate it at a gathering that involved a mitzvah, or at a meal convened to publicize the intercalation of a day into a month, or as second tithe in Jerusalem, if he ate an animal that died of itself, or one that was not properly slaughtered, if he ate non-kosher birds or non-kosher seafood, if he ate something from which tithes have not been separated – for all these he does not earn the designation, as it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">A glutton and a guzzler</a>."<br />

If he stole from his father and ate in his father's domain, or if he stole from others and ate in the domain of others – he does not qualify as a wayward and rebellious son, unless he steals from his father and eats in the domain of others. Rabbi Yose says not until he steals from both his father and his mother.<br />
<br />
The boy is not declared a wayward and rebellious son until both his father and mother are willing. If one of the parents is missing a hand or is lame, mute, blind, or deaf – the son does not become a wayward and rebellious son, because the parents need to be able to “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">seize him...take him...and say</a>.”<br />

<br />
A burglar who enters a house by tunneling through its wall is judged on account of his ultimate end. He is aware that the occupant of the house will defend his belongings, and it is therefore assumed that the burglar decides to kill an occupant if that becomes necessary. Therefore, the occupant is permitted to kill the burglar.<br />

Whether the rescuer is actually executed by the courts for killing the pursuer or whether he is subject to death at the hands of Heaven – is a subject of disagreement between later authorities.<br />
<br />
If someone being pursued broke items of the pursuer, he is exempt from paying, but if he broke items belonging to any other person, he is liable. However, if the rescuer was chasing the pursuer to prevent him from committing murder and broke vessels of any party, he is always exempt, because otherwise nobody would be saving his fellow from the pursuer.<br />

<br />
If a murderer struck his fellow with a stone or with a piece of iron, or if he held him in water or fire and the victim could not escape and died, the murderer is liable to execution. But if the murderer pushed him into water or into fire and he was able to escape, but he died anyway, the murderer is not liable to execution. If he incited a dog or a snake to bite a man, and a dog or a snake bit him, and he died, the murderer is not liable to execution. Since he did not murder the victim directly, he cannot be executed by a human court.<br />
<br />
If someone took the snake in his hand and held its fangs to the victim's flesh, Rabbi Yehudah rules that he is liable to the death penalty, but the Sages exempt him.<br />

Sanhedrin 77 – No Liability for Indirect Killing

This was done thus - he made a hole in a dam that stood between the water and the victim so that the water would gush out and drown the victim. In such a case, the water is considered like arrows that he shot at the victim, and he is liable to execution. <br />
<br />
However, this is only so when the water that reached the victim fell on him immediately after the barrier was breached. If some time lapsed before the water reached the victim, it is no longer considered the perpetrator's primary force, and he is not liable.<br />
<br />As a general principle, one is liable for murder only if it was caused by his direct force, not by any removed or consequential action, and, of course, if he has been properly warned a short while before the action.<br />

<br />
If they hit him one after the other, the last nine are not liable because they struck a man who would have died anyway. The first assailant is not liable because there is a remote possibility that the man would have recovered had the others not continued beating him. If they hit him simultaneously, each one can plead that the victim might have lived if not for the blows of others. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira makes the last one liable. Both derive their rulings from "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-17.htm">if a man strikes all human life</a>." <br />
<br />
If someone struck his fellow, and the judges assumed that he would die, but he recovered somewhat and then deteriorated and died, the attacker is liable. Rabbi Nechemiah makes him not liable, since there are grounds for asserting that the victim did not die a result of the attacker's blow.<br />

While it is certainly forbidden to kill any human being, this matter is outside of the jurisdiction of Sanhedrin. If one intended to kill a premature, nonviable baby but killed a viable one instead, he is not liable to execution because the warning given to him would have been uncertain.<br />
<br />
If he intended to strike an adult with a blow not sufficient to kill an adult, but it landed on a child instead, and it was sufficient to kill a child, and the child died, he is not liable because he did not intend to commit murder, and any warning would be uncertain.<br />

The Sages say that the claim of a defamer is judged by a court of twenty-three (small Sanhedrin), because defamation cases include capital cases.<br />
<br />
A defamer usually refers to a husband who falsely declares in court that his wife was not a virgin when their marriage was consummated. He claims that she had committed adultery after they were legally married and produces false witnesses to her adultery. After the witnesses are found false, he must pay a fine of 100 shekels to her father; he is liable to lashes, and he may never divorce her against her will.<br />

Rabbi Yehudah says, "We place them in a cell where they are fed barley until their stomachs burst."<br />
<br />
Who are these others? One explanation is that a murderer whose verdict has not been finalized – even though the judges have voted for a guilty sentence - got mixed with other murderers whose verdicts have been finalized. Since the verdict has to be announced in his presence, and they don't know who he is, and since moreover, they have to say to him, "So-and-so, you are liable," and again, they can't – he is free and with him all the other murderers. Rabbi Yehudah holds that since, after all, they are murderers and cannot be executed only because of a technicality, the court causes their deaths indirectly.<br />

<br />One who has been flogged twice by the court – the court places him in a cell, and there they feed him barely until his stomach bursts. How could that be? Here, we are dealing with one who repeated the same transgression twice, provided that this transgression carries the penalty of excision from Heaven. Since he demonstrated that he wanted to die, the court just sped up his death. However, if he transgressed multiple prohibitions, but each of them only once, he just tastes various prohibitions.<br />
<br />One who killed another but not in the presence of witnesses – that is, they gave him a warning, but he just nodded his head instead of a verbal reply or a similar technical disqualification – the court places him in a cell and feeds him scant bread and water until he dies.<br />
<br />
Complete cell procedure: They put him in a cell the size of his body, then fed him scant amounts until his stomach shrinks, then fed him abundant barley until his stomach bursts.<br />

One who steals service vessels in the Temple; one who blasphemes by a supernatural force, saying, "Let the supernatural force (that is, the idol) smite him (the blasphemer's enemy), his Creator, and his Provider"; and one who cohabits with an Aramean woman – zealots may kill him.<br />
<br />If a zealot comes to ask about this ruling, he is not told about it and is not given permission. He has to know it from before and then take the risk into his own hands. Furthermore, he can only do it while the sinner is engaged in his sin. If the sinner stops, and the zealot kills him after that, the zealot is responsible for murder.<br />

The following are liable to death at the hands of Heaven: one who eats produce before tithe separation, a non-Kohen who eats a Kohen's portion, a non-Kohen who serves in the Temple, and a ritually impure Kohen who serves in the Temple.<br />

One is liable for cursing a parent only if the parent is "among your people," that is, doing the deeds of your people – observing the Torah. One is liable for striking even a non-observant parent.<br />

<br />
There were three courts in Jerusalem, one sitting at the entrance to the Temple Mount, one higher up on the Temple Mount, at the entrance of the Temple Courtyard, and one even higher up the Mount sitting in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.<br />
<br />
The dissenting sage and his disputants on the local court would come to the court at the entrance to the Temple Mount, and the dissenting sage would say before the court, "Thus have I expounded, and thus have my colleagues expounded, thus have I taught, and thus have my colleagues taught." If the court judges have heard the answer from their teachers, they tell the disputants the law; if not, they go to a higher court. There, the procedure is repeated. If the highest court has a tradition, they tell it; if not, they decide it, and it becomes binding.<br />

<br />
A disciple who instructed people to act in accordance with his opinion that was overruled by the High Court is not liable – and it emerges that his stringency (no authority to decide the questions of law) is his leniency (not being liable as a rebellious sage).<br />

Sanhedrin 88 – How is a Judge Selected to High Court

From there, they elevate the deserving judge to the court that sits at the entrance to the courtyard and, from there – to the Sanhedrin, which sits in the Chamber of Hewn Stone. An additional qualification is that he constantly learns Torah but does not take credit for it for himself.<br />
<br />
With regard to a rebellious sage, greater stringency is attached to the teachings of the Sages, like the ones found in the Talmud, than to the words of the Torah. If, for example, he says that there is no commandment of tefillin, he is exempt since it is such an obvious distortion that it cannot be viewed as a ruling. However, if he says that there are five compartments in the tefillin and not four, he is liable.<br />

<br />
* The husband comes without the support of the witnesses, but the Sages fear that witnesses to adultery might come forward when gossip spreads;<br />
* The husband claimed to have witnesses of adultery, and the court of twenty-three was convened to try this capital case, but then the husband failed to produce witnesses. The Sages rule that the original twenty-three judges should be retained for the sake of their honor;<br />
* The witnesses warned the woman that if she commits adultery, she will be liable to the death penalty, but did not specify the method of execution;<br />
* The woman was learned, and the witnesses did not give her any warning not to commit adultery.<br />

A certain disputant said to him, "Woe to you, O sinners, for you say that the dead will live. Even the living eventually die, so how can the dead come back to life?" Geviha answered, "Woe to <i>you,</i> O sinners! If the non-existent (baby before it is born) come to life, then isn't it all the more possible that one who once lived will live again?" The disputant retorted, "You dare call me (and all of us) sinners? If I arise, I will kick you so hard that I will straighten out your hump!" Geviha said to him, "If you do that, you will be called a skilled doctor and command a large fee."<br />
<br />
The Girgashites were descendants of Canaan who moved to Africa when the Jews conquered Israel. They came back with Alexander the Great to demand the land back. Geviha ben Pesisa said to the Sages, "Let me answer. If I lose, tell them I am just a commoner, so their victory means nothing. If I win, say that the Torah of Moses defeated them." The Girgashites then claimed the Land, based on the fact that the Jews took "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/34-2.htm">the Land of Canaan according to its borders</a>." <br />
<br />
Geviha asked them, "From where do you bring the proof?" They said, "From the Torah." He said, I will also bring the proof from the Torah, "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/9-25.htm">Accursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers</a>." If a slave acquired property, to whom belongs the slave and the property? Certainly to his master! So the Land of Canaan belongs to us, the descendants of Shem, and not only that, but all your fields too. They thought for three days but found no answer. They then ran away and left their sown fields, which was great because that year was Shmita when work in the field was forbidden.<br />

Because he strengthened (Chizek) the heart of Israel toward their Father in Heaven. What did he do? He thrust a sword near the entrance to the study hall and said, "Whoever does not engage in Torah study will be pierced by this sword." He then supplied the oil to light the study halls. They searched all of Israel and could not find one unlearned person who was not well-versed in the Torah. Then, they searched within the territory of Judah and could not find even a young boy or girl, man or woman, who was not well-versed in the most intricate laws of ritual purity. In this generation, people neglected their most valuable land because of the Torah study.<br />
<br />
Sancheiriv understood <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/8-7.htm">the prophecy of Isaiah</a> as referring to him conquering Jerusalem. His army then made a ten-day journey in one day. When Sancheiriv reached Jerusalem, they built an observation platform for him, and he was amazed at how small the city was compared to the ones he had previously conquered. He told his soldiers to go to sleep, rest, and be ready to take the walls of Jerusalem apart in the morning. During the night, <a href="http://bible.cc/2_kings/19-35.htm">the angel of God came and burned the soldiers</a>.<br />

Do you choose for your descendants to be obliterated or for yourself to be delivered in the enemy's hand?" David chose the second, and Satan, disguised as a deer, drew the hunting David into the land of the Philistines, where Yishbi, the brother of Goliath, captured him.<br />
<br />
Yishbi put David under an olive press, but&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="" target="_blank">the ground under him softened through a miracle</a></span>. Yishbi was still sitting on top.<br />
<br />
Avishai, one of David's officers, was preparing to shampoo his hair for Sabbath when he saw bloodstains in the water and understood that David was in danger. He reasoned, "One can not ride on the king's horse - but what about in the time of danger?" They told him that in times of danger, it is allowed. He then mounted David's mule and rode off. The road miraculously contracted under him.<br />
<br />
On the road, Avishai saw Orpah, the mother of Yishbi. She tried to kill him with a spindle, but he killed her instead. Seeing Avishai approach, Yishbi threw David up and prepared a spear to catch him. <a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/21-17.htm">Avishai said the name of God, and David hung in the air</a>. Avishai then asked David what he was doing there, and David explained that he had chosen punishment for himself. Avishai advised him to leave the punishment for his descendants and save himself from the trouble. Avishai then said another name of God, David came down, and the two started running away. Yishbi kept pursuing them until they told him, "Look at your mother in the grave," after which they killed him. <br />
<br />
After this David's soldiers swore to him, "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/21-17.htm">You must no longer go forth with us in battle, so that the light of Israel not be extinguished</a>."<br />

The king of Assyria sent him a letter, "Greeting to Chizkiah, greetings to Jerusalem, greetings to the great God!" Nebuchadnezzar, the king's secretary, ran after the messenger to rewrite the letter in the correct order of greetings. He made three steps and was rewarded with the opportunity to destroy Jerusalem. People now make three steps at the end of prayer, asking to restore Jerusalem.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://bible.cc/jeremiah/52-12.htm">The general who came to destroy Jerusalem was Nebuzaradan</a>. He had three hundred mule-loads of iron-cutting axes, but one gate of Jerusalem swallowed them all. Nebuzaradan wanted to retreat, but the Heavenly voice told him, "You always wanted to destroy Jerusalem; now is your chance." With the wooden handle of a hatchet, he destroyed all the gates, conquered Jerusalem, and burned the Temple.<br />
<br />
Nebuzaradan saw the blood of Zechariah seething on the floor of the Temple. He asked, "What is it?" They told him, "Blood of offerings that spilled." He brought offerings, but it did not look the same. He then threatened torture, and they told him the truth: Zechariah prophesied about the destruction of the Temple, and they killed him, a Kohen, and a prophet. Nebuzaradan then brought the Sages and slew them over the blood, but it did not rest. He killed schoolchildren and Kohanim and kept killing until the count came to 940,000. He then called to Zechariah, "Do you want me to kill everyone?" - and the blood rested.<br />
<br />
Nebuzaradan then reasoned, "If for killing one person God punished them so, what will He do to that man (meaning himself)?" He then sent a will to his household and converted to Judaism.<br />

Sanhedrin 97 – The Generation at the Time of the Mashiach and The Age of the World

<span style="font-size: medium;">In the generation when the son of David (Mashiach) will come, the meeting place of the scholars will be used for licentiousness, the wisdom of the scholars will decay, those who fear sin will be despised, and the face of the generation will be like the face of a dog. The truth will be absent, as in "<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/59-15.htm">And the truth will be absent, and he that turns away from evil will become foolish</a>.” <br />
<br />Rabbi Meir Abulafia (c. 1170 – 1244, Burgos, Spain), in his book “Yad Ramah,” remarks: “I am in wonderment! According to these signs, why has the son of David not come in this generation of ours?”<br />
<br />But how can we say the truth will be absent when there is a promise that the Jewish people will never be devoid of Torah scholars devoted to truth? - Truth will be divided into many small groups, each with its own truth, so it will be tough to find.<br />
<br />
The world is destined to exist for six thousand years; the first two thousand were of nothingness, without the Torah, the second two thousand were of Torah, and the third two thousand are the days of the Messiah. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/the-age-of-the-universe---a-torah-true-perspective/3097384">This, however, is only talking about the last 7-year cycle, in which we find ourselves, but according to one estimate in Kabbalah, we are at the end of sixth Shmita, at  42,000 years divine years, which translates into 15 billion human years</a>.<br />
<br />
There are many calculations of the world's end, most of which have already passed. <br />

<br />
In the generation of the Messiah, there will be denunciation among the Torah scholars.<br />
<br />
The Messiah will come to the wholly virtuous or sinful generation. If a person is somewhat virtuous, he is unlikely to repent because he focuses on his good attributes.  On the other hand, one who completely lacks virtue has no grounds for self-deception and thus is open to the realization that he must repent and merit God's redemption.<br />
<br />
The coming of the Messiah will be preceded by multiple troubles and tribulations. Ulla said, "May he come, but may I not see him," but Rav Yosef said, "May he come, and may I merit to sit in the shadow of his donkey's dung!"<br />

Shabbat 10 – Giving a gift

When God gave Jews the Shabbat, He said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=31#P2431">To know that I am God who sanctifies them</a>.” The words “to know” mean this: God told Moses, “I have a wonderful present in My treasure house, and its name is Shabbat, go and tell them.” 
<br />
<br />
In the same vein, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught that if one gives bread or other food to a child, he has to inform the child's parents. How does he do it? He rubs a little oil or rubs cosmetic paint on the child's eye – the parents will ask the child about it, and he will tell them about the present. Today, though, this may arouse suspicion, so it's better to rub some of the food that he gave.
<br />
<br />
However, Rav Chama taught that one should NOT tell about a gift, based on the phrase in the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2523">And Moses did NOT know that the skin of his face became radiant.</a>” How is this to be reconciled? – It's no problem really, Rav Chama meant a situation where the gift will become revealed in any case, and that is why one does not have to inform about it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was talking about a situation where the gift would otherwise not be revealed, and one has to tell about it, to increased the amount of good feelings and friendship among people.
<br />
<br />
However, Shabbat is known – it is a good day of rest, so why did God ask Moses to inform about it? – While it is true that the day itself is known for its rest, the reward for it in the future world is not known, and that is why God had to tell about it.

As usual, “exempt” means that the Sages prohibited it, to put him farther away from a transgression, but this is not a real violation. But why would this be prohibited? The sea is not a public area where many people walk!? – Nevertheless, it is similar to a public area in the vastness of its expanse. Such areas are called “karmelit,” as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/10/shabbat-7-special-area-called-karmelit.html">we discussed before</a>, and carrying there is prohibited.
<br />
<br />
Likewise, he is prohibited from carrying from a ship to the land, and even from a ship to a ship. However, if two ships are tied together, then carrying between them on Shabbat is permitted, because both represent private areas. If they become untied, then carrying between them is again prohibited, even if they are still together – because it is very likely that in the near future that will separate.

Shabbat 102 – Building

<br />
<br />
This rule seems to have two cases mixed up! – Rav Ashi explained that indeed, there is a missing part in this ruling, and in the corrected version there are three cases: throwing the object that a dog ate (no sacrifice), remembering about Shabbat in midair (no sacrifice), and immediately forgetting about Shabbat (there is a sacrifice and it helps).
<br />
<br />
If so, why still teach the old ruling and not the corrected one? That is because each such ruling has a spiritual secret in it, and it also has a practical application. The spiritual secret is the more important one, so when they come into conflict, the ruling is taught according to it, at the expense of the practical application, which has then to be amended.
<br />
<br />
How much does one have to build on Shabbat to be liable? – Any amount. How can any amount of building be useful? – A poor may build a small hole to keep is money in it. Corresponding to this, they would store needles in the Temple's curtain. – No, that's a bad example, because we have a Temple rule: “There is no show of poverty in the place of opulence." Rather, a poor may want to fix a very small hole. And what would be a similar labor in the Temple? – They would fix a small hole in a beam that a worm has eaten – because all prohibited Shabbat work has its source in the building of the Temple.

Although with sowing there are amounts required for violation, such as two seeds – this is because people usually won't trouble themselves to sow one seed. However, with plowing, any amount of preparing the earth is significant.
<br />
<br />
If one is cutting branches from a live tree, then if he is doing it to improve the tree – any amount of cutting is significant. However, if his purpose is to collect firewood, he is liable once he collects enough to cook a “light egg” – that is, an egg of a chicken, which is the easiest to cook.
<br />
<br />
If one writes two letters, whether with his right hand or left hand, in any language, he is liable. Rabbi Yose say that the prohibition extends even further, and that any two useful marks, not letters, already make one liable. Others say that on the contrary, the two letters must be part of a word. Another question arises when one intended to write a long word, like Daniel, and stopped after writing the first two letters, dalet and nun, thus forming the word “Dan.” Even though he did not complete his intent (the usual condition in Shabbat violations) , Rabbi Yehudah holds him liable.

And what was their wisdom? They said that “aleph”, “beth” means “alaph binah” - learn insight. “Gimel,” “dalet” stands for “Gemol dalim” – aid the  needy. They continued to expound the shape of every letter, and of every letter pair, going forward, and backward, and even combing the letter by using the “first letter – last letter method.” Why do letters of “falsehood,” “sheker” are close together in the alphabet? – Because falsehoods are common. And why the letters of “truth” - “emet” are far apart? – Because truth is rare. Why the letters of “emet – truth” stand on a solid foundation? Because in end truth will stand. Correspondingly, the letters of “falsehood – sheker” all stand on one leg (one point touching the foundation) to indicate that in the end falsehood will not endure.
<br />
<br />
When is one not liable for writing on Shabbat? – When his writing will not endure. For example, if he wrote with fruit juice, which will dry out, or he wrote in the mud or on dust. He is also not liable if he wrote in an unusual way: by turning his hand backward, by holding the pen with his mouth or with his elbow – because people don't normally write this way.

For example, in the First Commandment, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=20#P2054">I am God your Lord</a>” the word “I” has a somewhat unusual long form, “Anochi”. This stands for “Ana nafshi ketivat yahavit” and means “I Myself wrote and gave the Torah.”
<br />
<br />
If one tears his clothing in anger or for a dead, he is acting destructively, and for destructive acts one is not liable for Shabbat violation. But if he destroys in order to repair, then he is indeed liable. What is the minimal measure of destruction in this case? – The same as would be for repair.
<br />
<br />
However, we learned in another place that one is liable for tearing on Shabbat!? – This is talking about his own dead, for whom he is obligated to rend his clothes. This is also true if a Sage dies, for them everybody is obligated to mourn.
<br />
<br />
Rav Avin said that if he tears to cool his anger, then he has achieved a constructive purpose and should be liable for it on Shabbat. But is such behavior even allowed? One should never get angry, and freely venting one's anger is tantamount to subjugating oneself to its power, where one's soul burns out!? – True! What Rav Avin meant is that one only pretends to be angry, to show his displeasure with specific people.

Shabbat 106 – Traps

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/01/shabbat-105-abbreviations.html">Earlier we learned</a> that for doing destructive acts on Shabbat one is not liable. However, Rabbi Shimon finds two exceptions to this: wounding a person or burning something. Here one is liable for Shabbat violation. Why? After all, Rabbi Shimon is the one who permits unintended violations, such as dragging a bench on the ground, even though he may dig a ditch! Rabbi Shimon will tell you that since the Torah had to allow circumcision on Shabbat, this shows us that normally making a wound is prohibited. Then what about our previous learning that ALL destructive acts are not a Torah violation? – That is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. And what is the basis for it? He said that circumcision is a constructive act of rectifying the child.
<br />
<br />
Trapping an animal constitutes hunting, and that is prohibited on Shabbat. But what is trapping?&nbsp;–&nbsp;If one drives a bird into a cage or a deer into courtyard – in other words, if he makes the animal sufficiently trapped so that he can catch it in one attempt. A swallow bird is an exception: it loves freedom so much that even after being trapped in a small enclosure it will not becomes submissive, but will try to fly away instead. Therefore, a smaller than usual enclosure would make it trapped.

However, if a second person sat in that door and made the exit completely blocked, the second one is liable. The first one is not, because he did nothing.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if a person sat in the door and completely blocked it, and then the second one came and sat there also, then, even if the first person leaves and the second one is the one who is blocking the door now – only the first one is liable, because he effected trapping, while the second one again is doing nothing at all.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/01/eight-reptiles.html">The eight reptiles mentioned by the Torah</a> are different from other crawling creatures: if one bruises one of them (such as a mouse) on Shabbat, he is liable, but for others (like a snake), he is not. The difference is that a mouse has thicker hide, and a bruise leads to blood accumulation, which is taking away a life, albeit in a small measure. The hide of other reptiles is soft, akin to skin, and the reddening caused by a minor bruise soon dissipates. 
<br />
<br />
One is also liable to trapping one of the eight reptiles, because people do normally catch them, for various reasons.

That bird skins qualify as hides? – <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/01/shabbat-107-two-people-catch-deer.html">We know that</a>! One who bruises a bird on Shabbat is liable, and that can only be because birds have hides, under which the blood collects.” His student Abaye told him, “Actually, Rav Huna is teaching us a lot. Since birds skins are perforated with weathers, we might have thought that this makes them invalid for writing a tefillin, and he teaches us otherwise.”
<br />
<br />
Mar bar Ravina asked of Rav Nachman, “Can one write tefillin on the skin of a kosher fish?” Rav Nachman answered, “When Elijah the prophet comes, he will tell us.” What kind of answer is this? We see ourselves that fish do have skin. Furthermore, we know the teaching that the skin and the bones of a fish accept ritual impurity of a corpse in the house, so of course they have skin! – He meant, is that skin valid. Does the stench completely depart from it, or perhaps it never does? This is one of the unclear facts that Elijah has the authority to reveal, and that's why we must wait for him.

However, one may prepare a small quantity that will be consumed that day. Rabbi Yose challenged this: “Is brine not the same, whether in large or in small quantities? If you have a law like this one, then people will say that a small amount of work on Shabbat is permitted, and only a large amount is forbidden. Rather, all brine is forbidden to be made on Shabbat, unless one first adds oil either to water or to salt – and in this way he makes a distinction and a reminder that it is Shabbat.”
<br />
<br />
Generally it is prohibited to effect cure of minor diseases on Shabbat. The Sages accepted this decree due to the possibility that one may come to grind medicine on Shabbat, which would definitely be prohibited. However, if he eats foods that have therapeutic effect, but that are generally eaten also by healthy people, then it is not obvious that he does it for healing, and it is allowed.

On Friday afternoon close to sundown, a tailor should not go out into the street with his needle, lest he forget that has it, and come to carry it four steps in the street, when it is already dark, which would be a Shabbat violation. Similarly, a scribe should not go out with his pen. Even though a pen is much larger than a needle, he still might forget that he is carrying it, and this applies even to objects larger than a needle.
<br />
<br />
Why are the above rules true? A tailor usually carries his needle pinned to his clothing; this is an uncommon manner of carrying, and as such it is not prohibited by the Torah, but only by the decree of the Sages. A further precaution of not carrying it while it is still Friday would constitute a decree to protect another decree, and that is usually not done!? We have to admit that he is carrying it in his hand. 
<br />
<br />
But we learned a clear rule, that a tailor should not go out of Friday afternoon with a needle pinned to his garment! – That is talking on Shabbat itself. But we learned yet another rule, that he should not go out with a needle pinned to his garment on Friday afternoon!? – We have to admit that this rule is not universal, but that it is only the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who says that for a craftsman the way of carrying common in his profession is in fact prohibited by the Torah on Shabbat. 
<br />
<br />
Indeed, we learned the following rule in the name of Rabbi Yehudah: “A carpenter may not go out with his ruler behind his ear, nor a money-changer with a dinar behind his ear” – which proves our point.

For this reason, the Sages prohibited drinking any water that was left uncovered for enough time that the snake hiding behind the vessel might have appeared and drunk from. In other times and at other places this law should not apply, but it has mystical connotations, and is discussed often in the Talmud.
<br />
<br />
What is a cure for a one who drank water left uncovered? – It is made of a tree used for shepherd's staff. If one does not have it, he should take five roses and five cups of beer, and boil them together. A certain man drank uncovered water. The mother of Rav Achadvoi cooked roses in beer and made him drink it in a hot oven, and poison came out of him like a green leaf of a palm branch.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, they should bring a sweet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrog">etrog</a>, carve out a hole in it, fill it with honey, then cook it in burning coals, and he should eat it. The Talmud then discusses what to do when one swallows a snake, or when a snake enters a woman.

Vinegar strengthens the gums, and therefore sipping it, obviously done for health reasons, is forbidden. However, one can dip bread in vinegar while eating – since it was normal for people to dip their bread in vinegar – and if he is thereby cured, then he is cured.
<br />
<br />
If one feels pain in his loins, he should not smear them with wine or vinegar. These liquids are not commonly used for anointment, and thus his intention is obvious. However, he can apply oil to his skin, since normal, and not only sick people, do so. He should not use rose oil though unless he is a prince, that is, a son of a prominent or a rich person, because princes use rose oil even on weekdays, and it is not apparent that he is doing this only for therapeutic reason. Rabbi Shimon says that all Israel are considered princes, and thus they all can anoint themselves with rose oil on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
Rava said: “The law is like Rabbi Shimon, but not for his reason.” What does he mean? Rava does not agree that all Israel are princes, but he permits using rose all in those locales where it is common – and in Rava's locale it was indeed common, so he allowed everyone to use rose oil on Shabbat.

Shabbat 112 – And these are the knots...

Now the Talmud comes to give examples of which knots are prohibited: the camel driver's knot and the sailor's knot. Both are meant to be remain tied forever, and they are thus considered permanent knots. However, if one ties a knot to these permanent knots, such as a leash to the camel, then this is meant for a week or two, but not for all time, and therefore it is not prohibited by the Torah. However, the Sages prohibited even such knots, because if they were allowed, people might come to tie even permanent knots.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, knots that are tied and untied every day are not prohibited at all. For example, a woman may tie the opening of her chemise, string of a hat, or a girdle (a wide belt tied by laces), straps of a shoe or a sandal; additionally, one may tie leather bags of wine and oil, or a pot of meat, where a piece of cloth was sometimes tied to its top.
<br />
<br />
Since the rule is that any knot that is tied and untied daily is permitted, then why did the Talmud have to give us all of the last examples? – They are all necessary. For example, in the case of a woman's chemise we are talking about a chemise with two straps, where we might have thought that she will tie one of them permanently, and only tie and untie the other ones – the Talmud thus informs us that we are not concerned about this possibility but rather assume that she will tie and untie both daily.

<br />
<br />
Folding garments improves them in some measure, therefore, one may fold his garments multiple times if he plans to use them on the same day, but not if he plans to use them after Shabbat, because then he is preparing on Shabbat for weekdays. Likewise, one may make the beds any number of times during Shabbat, but not when Shabbat will end soon.
<br />
<br />
In general, on should honor Shabbat by wearing special clothing and by walking and talking in special ways, just as Isaiah said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1058.htm">If you restrain your feet and business, proclaim Shabbat a delight – then you will delight with God</a>.”<br />
<br />
When Naomi instructed Ruth for a night encounter with Boaz, she told her to <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2903.htm">bathe and anoint herself and don special garments</a>. Which garments were these? – Those of Shabbat. Ruth, however was wise, and the rule is “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2809.htm">Give to a wise, and she will become wiser</a>”, so she first went to the place of the meeting, and then prepared herself – so that the people meeting her would not suspect her of being a prostitute. Incidentally, why did Boaz ask the harvesters, “To whom does this young woman belong?” Boaz was the member of the Sanhedrin, the leading Sage of the generation, and a righteous person, and he did not inquire about every woman who came to glean his field!? – He noticed her wisdom in fulfilling precisely the laws of gleaning (two stalks belong to the poor, three should remain to the field owner) and her modestly in sitting down, not bending to pick up the stalks.

We learn from his example that one should dress up for Shabbat, prayer, and Torah study.
<br />
<br />
Torah scholar who wears soiled garments makes people dislike the Torah and is liable to a punishment. So too, it is a disgrace for a Torah scholar to go out in patched shoes. But Rab Acha bar Chanina did go out wearing patched shows!? – We mean, patches on patches, but one level of patches is allowed.
<br />
<br />
Which Torah scholar can be appointed a leader over a community? – One whom you can ask any question in learning, even in the areas rarely studied. For such a scholar the community has the obligation to provide  – but how much? – only for bread but not for luxuries.
<br />
<br />
Before the calendar was fixed, Yom Kippur could fall on Friday. In this case Rabbi Ishmael permits to fold garments on Yom Kippur in preparation for Shabbat. If Yom Kippur falls on Sunday, one can burn Shabbat offerings in the Temple on the Yom Kippur day, because Yom Kippur has lesser sanctity than Shabbat. However, Rabbi Akiva considers the two days to be of equal strenght, and fordibs preparing on one for the other. Both base their proof on the phrase from the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=28#P4585">Bring Shabbat offering on its own Shabbat</a>,” but understand it differently.

Shabbat 115 – What can be saved from fire on Shabbat
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1uTkAb3nbYddQNUl2L2c0v7VXIiEEfM-3PI650EJBjAObRnkMDuUjDuR8Fs4oYcXzotepluh-eOKPFNUd9rTr2e-wLesC1UHFhrh9HX5rP1k7dNy3QDTx4mQYBfAk4fIvOJd_HNPjZs3b/s1600/Egbert+van+der+Poel+-+A+house+on+fire+at+night+with+peasants+coming+to+rescue.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1uTkAb3nbYddQNUl2L2c0v7VXIiEEfM-3PI650EJBjAObRnkMDuUjDuR8Fs4oYcXzotepluh-eOKPFNUd9rTr2e-wLesC1UHFhrh9HX5rP1k7dNy3QDTx4mQYBfAk4fIvOJd_HNPjZs3b/s320/Egbert+van+der+Poel+-+A+house+on+fire+at+night+with+peasants+coming+to+rescue.jpg" width="304" /></a>In general, one is not allowed to extinguish fire on Shabbat, and this extends even to cases where that fire is destroying his possessions. Since one can't extinguish the fire, all he can do is save his possessions from it. Even here, there are limitations: one can only save specific items and in specific amounts. What is the rationale for this view?
<br />
<br />
A man is naturally nervous when he sees his possessions being destroyed by fire, and he may come to extinguish it, thus violating Shabbat. In order to prevent this, the Sages established a set of rules on how to behave in the face fire on Shabbat. Being mindful of these rules, one will not come to extinguish the fire. According to this, one is permitted less than not in the presence of fire, and we are talking about carrying from his house into a courtyard. On another theory, one is permitted slightly more, and we are talking about carrying into the semi-public street, or a “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/10/shabbat-7-special-area-called-karmelit.html">karmelit</a>”. The rationale though remains the same – to stop a man from violation.
<br />
<br />
It should be mentioned that if there is any danger to human life, one should by all means extinguish the fire. Also, since in many time periods the neighbors, on seeing a Jewish property burn, might start plundeing it, then any fire became a matter of saving one's life, and any fire is to be extinguished, with the possible exception of a barn far away from people. Still, in the next few  pages we will learn the laws as they were formulated in the times of the Talmud.
<br />
<br />
First, can one save holy scriptures? The answer here is yes, whether it refers to the Torah of the writings of the prophets, and whether one can read them or no. Back then, people did not read the writings of the prophets on Shabbat. That was prohibited because the writing were considered entertaining, and being absorbed in reading them one might have missed a public lecture which was filled with practical laws. Such lecture was very important to the populace, and one was supposed to attend it rather than read the prophets. Nevertheless, even such writings, unusable on Shabbat, could be saved.

Shabbat 116 – Eighty-five letters
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFX6wz7F9eKj5rMzxuSVAlS-jnNuR6EEp4nJw7PeZOnms7kaUjnpAU6r3Z09SlikbWQ2faDPUqhsEuCHBmxxjG9QQ-oI2y5dZywkfgP3cAhh9PGUaV8PfUcVrWBoJEikYKvyJzidAnCz-p/s1600/John+Dawson+Watson+-+Fireside+Thoughts.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFX6wz7F9eKj5rMzxuSVAlS-jnNuR6EEp4nJw7PeZOnms7kaUjnpAU6r3Z09SlikbWQ2faDPUqhsEuCHBmxxjG9QQ-oI2y5dZywkfgP3cAhh9PGUaV8PfUcVrWBoJEikYKvyJzidAnCz-p/s320/John+Dawson+Watson+-+Fireside+Thoughts.jpg" width="232" /></a>What is the smallest book in the Torah? – Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that it is the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=10#P4021">When the Ark went forth, Moses said, 'Arise, O God, and scatter your enemies! Let your foes flee before You!'...</a>'” which contains eighty-five letters. If this phrase is indeed a separate book, then the Book of Numbers contains not one but three books - before this phrase, after it, and the phrase itself, and the total number of the books in the Torah is seven.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, Rav Huna asked a question, “A Torah scroll where many letters were erased and only eighty-five letters are intact, can it be saved from fire on Shabbat?” There is no doubt that a worn-out scrolls with even less letters deserves respect and cannot be destroyed directly but has to be “buried” in a clean place, and if it decays, it decays. The question is, can it be saved from fire? Rav Chisda answered that it was not permitted, and they started arguments back and forth.
<br />
<br />
A related question: the side margins of the Torah scroll, may they be saved from fire? Do we say that the scroll that had  letters – once the letters have been erased – looses its sanctity and may not be saved, but the margins, which never had letters, are more sanctified and may be saved? Or the other way around, if the letters once were there, then the sanctity persists, but not if they were never there? Here too the views are divided.

Shabbat 117 – Saving food

Moreover, if the tefillin bag has money in it, then – even though normally money cannot be handled on Shabbat – here he is not required to throw it away, but can save the bag with the tefillin and the money inside.
<br />
<br />
One is also allowed to save food, both for humans and for animals. However, one can only save enough for Shabbat: for example, if the fire broke out of Friday evening, he can save the amount necessary for three meals, but if it started on Shabbat morning, he can only save two meals. Rabbi Yose allows to save three meals under all circumstances, because in his opinion the law is already strict enough, and there is not need to count meals.
<br />
<br />
The rationale for both opinions is the same: in truth, we are talking about carrying the food into a courtyard, properly fenced from the public area, so carrying any amount of it should be allowed. However, since a person is naturally agitated when his possessions are burning and may start extinguishing the fire, the Sages added prohibitions, so that while observing them he will recall that if he is not allowed to save all the food he wants, then certainly he is not allowed to extinguish the fire.

Shabbat 118 – Three or four meals?
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjm-rmmjrd2rjUYszkoHui80RNr823zEJllVgxEYSoF8omciThxRCtCedC2u5Z2pdV6K9gb00ZUENxkSQBiio8tYg9T8qdzt-zHHH3CjB1n5eaKcZ6oucp9mYv0V9DX8esYyspm0SX-xEcH/s1600/Gillis+Van+Tilborch+-+A+couple+sitting+and+having+a+meal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="220" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjm-rmmjrd2rjUYszkoHui80RNr823zEJllVgxEYSoF8omciThxRCtCedC2u5Z2pdV6K9gb00ZUENxkSQBiio8tYg9T8qdzt-zHHH3CjB1n5eaKcZ6oucp9mYv0V9DX8esYyspm0SX-xEcH/s320/Gillis+Van+Tilborch+-+A+couple+sitting+and+having+a+meal.jpg" width="320" /></a>On Shabbat one is obligated to eat three meals, one of Friday evening and two others on the Saturday day. However, Rabbi Chidka says that one needs to eat four. Both opinions are based on the same phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1973">Moses announced, 'Eat it today, for today is God's Sabbath. You will not find [anything] in the field today</a>.” The word “today” is mentioned three times, and this means three meals. And Rabbi Chidka? – He says that these three meals are during the day, and there is also  a fourth meal, on Friday night. But <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/01/shabbat-117-saving-food.html">we just learned</a> that if there fire breaks out on Friday night, he can only save three meals!? – Rabbi Chidka will answer that he already ate the Friday night meal, and then the fire broke out, so he saves the three meals for the next day, to the total of four. But we learned that Rabbi Yose allows to save three meals under all circumstances!? – True, Rabbi Chidka has nothing to say, and we are forced to conclude that this ruling does not agree with Rabbi Chidka, but he is entitled to his opinion.
<br />
<br />
One who observes eating three meals on Shabbat is saved from three calamities at the end of days. One who delights in Shabbat is forgiven all the idol worship he did during the week; some say that he is given a boundless heritage. Finally, one who delights in Shabbat is given his heart's wishes.

Shabbat 119 – Each one has his own mitzvah

For example, Rav Nachman said, “May my reward come from my carefully observing the three meals of Shabbat." Rabbi Yose was extremely modest and pliable to the demands of his scholarly colleagues. Abbaye, when he saw a young scholar complete a tractate of the Talmud, would make a feast for everyone.
<br />
<br />
Following are some ways in which the Sages used to honor the Shabbat. Rav Abahu would sit on an ivory stool and fan the fire for cooking; Rav Safra would singe the head of an animal; Rabbah and Rav Yosef would split wood; Rav Zeira would kindle the fire.
<br />
<br />
Yosef Mokir Shabi (Yosef Who Honors Shabbat) would spare no expense for Shabbat. There was a rich man in his&nbsp;neighborhood&nbsp; to whom astrologers predicted that all his wealth will go to this Yosef. He sold it all, bought an extremely valuable pearl with the money, and had it sown into his hat, to alwayscarry it with him. However, as he was passing a bridge, the wind blew the hat off his head and a fish swallowed it, fishermen caught the fish and Yosef bought it - since there was no one else who would buy such a fish this late, close to the beginning of the Shabbat. He then found the pearl and sold it for thirteen attics full of golden dinars. A certain elder then met him and told him the rule, “He who borrows for the sake of Shabbat, Shabbat repays him.”

However, in discussing the case of a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav (a man who had a gonorrheal discharge)</a>, we find one ruling that allows him to carry a pouch to collect his discharge, while the other one forbids it. How are we to understand the opinion that it is allowed? The answer is that only that labor that is needed is prohibited on Shabbat. However, this man needs not his pouch but what collects in it (so that he can know when he becomes ritually pure), and that carrying is permitted – this is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
<br />
<br />
Another Friday night precaution: one should not delouse his garment or read a book, using a oil lamp, lest he strain to see something and adjust the light. On Shabbat during the day, how is one to delouse his garment? One should roll the flee between his fingers and throw it away, but not kill it. Nor should one do this in the street, out of respect for the passer-byes. Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha&nbsp;thought&nbsp;that he could read by lamp light, and almost came to tilt the lamp. Some say, he did tilt it, and later wrote a note, “When the Temple is rebuilt, I will bring a fine sacrifice for my violation.”<br />
<br />
Can one visit sick people on Shabbat? Beit Shammai prohibit it, but Beit Hillel reluctantly allow it. One should pray for the sick when he visits, and say that “It is Shabbat, when we are forbidden to pray for daily needs, but the recovery is near.”

We <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/01/shabbat-117-saving-food.html">learned earlier</a> that the Sages have put additional limitations on saving food from fire from Shabbat, in order that while observing these, one does not come actually extinguish the fire, which would be a violation. Additionally, they allowed him to save only as much food as needed for Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
However, if a basket is full of loaves, he may save the complete basket. He may also save a barrel of wine, even though it is much more than needed for Shabbat. Furthermore, he can tell others, “Come and save food for yourself,” and if they are wise, they will make a reckoning with him after Shabbat, for their wages as laborers saving his food. Why do they need to make a reckoning?! He said, “Save for yourself,” so it is their food now! – They are righteous, and will not keep the food. If they are righteous, how can they take money for working on Shabbat? – They are righteous, but not that righteous. We said that they were wise, not righteous, and they know that since he did not promise them money for sure, this is not considered Shabbat wages.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas tells us the rule that one may cover a carriage, trunk, or closet in which fire has taken hold, and cover it with a hide – since hide singes but does not burn. One may also surround the fire with clay jugs filled with water, and if they burst and extinguish the fire – so be it. However, this last ruling is a problem, since it seems to violate even the lenient of opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who permits unintended benefit on Shabbat.

However, if a Jewish minor wants to extinguish the fire, the Jew should stop him, since it is the Jew's responsibility to have minors rest on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
Yosef ben Simai was the king's treasurer. A fire once broke out in his courtyard on Shabbat, and the men of the Roman governer of Tzippori came to extinguish the fire, but he stopped them. However, a miracle happened for him, and rain fell and extinguished the fire. Later Yosef sent to each man of the garrison two sela coins, and to their leader he sent fifty. When the Sages heard of the matter, they said, “He did not have to do it, since we learned, 'we don't tell him to extinguish nor do we stop them.'”
<br />
<br />
One may invert a bowl over a lamp to protect a wooden beam above, and one may overturn the bowl over a scorpion, so that it should not sting. In fact, one may kill the dangerous animals like a snake. The  spirit of the pious ones is not pleased with one who kills a snake on Shabbat, but the spirit of the Sages is not pleased with those pious ones.

However, if he lit it for the sake of a Jew, one may not use it. Why? Firstly, a Jew should not instruct a gentile to do forbidden Shabbat work. Secondly, a Jew is not allowed to benefit from Shabbat violation. In fact, even after Shabbat he should wait for as long as it would take to perform the work in question, and only then use the result.
<br />
<br />
If a gentile constructed a catwalk to disembark from a ship, a Jew may disembark after him, but if he did it for a Jew, one may not use it. It once happened that Rabban Gamliel and the other Sages were arriving on a ship Friday night, a gentile made a catwalk, and they also used it.
<br />
<br />
Why do we need two cases? In the case of the lamp you could have said, “One light serves a hundred people” and permit its use. The ruling therefore teaches that this principle is not applicable here, and the lamp is still forbidden. The case of a catwalk is given to introduce the story. But how could they disembark if, as we will soon learn, one is not permitted to walk outside two thousand steps on Shabbat, and they were beyond that limit when Shabbat started!? – They measured the distance with a calibrated telescope, and they were within it. But still, the gentile made the catwalk for them too!? – No, they were not in his view when he did it.

House construction and repairs are considered building and are forbidden to be performed on Shabbat. Therefore, a door of a house, once detached, cannot be reattached to it. Moreover, it cannot even be moved on Shabbat, since it has no use by itself, and it considered “muktzeh,” something not prepared for use on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
By contrast, utensils such as carriages, trunks and movable closets that can nevertheless be moved are not considered muktzeh and can be used on Shabbat. Even their doors, although unusable by themselves if detached, can be moved and even put back into their place. There is a different opinion,  however, which considers large utensil to have the same status as houses.
<br />
<br />
The laws of other utensils also depend on their intended use. For example, one may take a hammer, usually associated with forbidden work, and use it to break nuts; a shovel can be used to scoop  dried figs from the bottom of the barrel; a pitchfork can be used to give food to a child who is stranded on the other side of the river;  a hand needle may be used to remove a splinter and a sackmaker's needle may be used to open a door with it. What kind of hammer do we mean? One that is used for ordinary tasks, but not a blacksmith's hammer, since it is designated only for blacksmith's work. Others say that even a blacksmith's hammer may be used for the permitted work of cracking nuts. Similar disagreements exist in regard to all items listed above.

Shabbat 124 – Prophet Nechemia and Shabbat
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrhUkhqU08__0OcTuDEk7N0Bge-8b30OPECERsjTc3MfSdaZ5cFG0HvMEtWsipgItWI8QcdMxa0th-m2UUo2vqMnspbjK1HpgfKQaOrZAPwqBamDrJIbGDe8TYrL8Nz3odP_CxpYgrpy9A/s1600/William-Adolphe+Bouguereau+-+The+Broken+Pitcher.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrhUkhqU08__0OcTuDEk7N0Bge-8b30OPECERsjTc3MfSdaZ5cFG0HvMEtWsipgItWI8QcdMxa0th-m2UUo2vqMnspbjK1HpgfKQaOrZAPwqBamDrJIbGDe8TYrL8Nz3odP_CxpYgrpy9A/s320/William-Adolphe+Bouguereau+-+The+Broken+Pitcher.jpg" width="203" /></a>Prophet Nechemia says, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b13.htm">During those days, I saw people in Judah pressing wine-vats on the Shabbat and bringing in the heaps from the field</a>.” On seeing this, he devoted himself to halting the Shabbat violations and restoring the special character of the Shabbat day. One of the measures that he employed, together with the Sages of the Sanhedrin, was the establishment of the prohibitions of “muktzeh,” things set aside and not to be used on Shabbat. When the degree of Shabbat observance improved, the Sages gradually eased the restrictions. Most of the arguments about muktzeh on Shabbat are about how far did this easement go.
<br />
<br />
The prevailing ruling therefore is that one may move all utensils in order to use them for a permitted purpose, with a few exceptions. However, Rabbi Nechemyah maintains that one can use the utensil only for the same purpose as it was originally designated.
<br />
<br />
If a utensil broke on Shabbat, its pieces can be used, but only if the remaining piece can be put for some use. For example, fragments of a mixing bowl can be used to form an improvised cover for a jug. Rabbi Yehudah limits it further: this use should be similar to that of the complete utensil, for example, fragments of glass can be used only if you can pour oil in them.

Stones are normally not prepared for Shabbat use and are therefore considered to be set aside from use,  or muktzeh. However, if this is stone is inside a gourd – which is needed to help the gourd sink and draw water – then if the stone is attached so securely that it will not fall out, it is considered to be part of the gourd, and the whole contraption is permitted to draw water with. Similarly, if a vine is tied to pitcher, it is considered part of the pitcher, and one can draw water with it. 
<br />
<br />
A window shutter is also a utensil, but in some ways it is a part of the building. Therefore, it can be used only if it is attached to the building by a rope, and only if the rope is so short that it hangs on it while not in use and does not reach the ground – these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer. However, the Sages say that even without these two conditions one can use the shutter on Shabbat. What is the reason for the disagreement? Rabbi Eliezer maintains that unless the shutter is attached by a short rope, putting it in the window constitutes building. However, the Sages answer that this is a temporary situation, and is therefore not considered building at all.

Shabbat 126 – Stopping Shabbat rest

One should rest on Shabbat. The Sages even prohibited certain actions requiring too much exertion, thus guarding Shabbat rest further. However, for guests, for students, for sick, and for his animals one sometimes should exert himself, setting aside Shabbat rest, and there the Sages have relaxed the prohibitions. For example, one may move away four or five boxes of straw or grain – if he needs the space to seat the guests or the students – provided that he does not clear a complete storehouse.
<br />
<br />
What kinds of food can he move? He can move the Kohen's portion, even though only the Kohanim can eat it – provided that it is ritually pure and thus can altogether be used. Furthermore, he can move “d'mai” – produce from which the tithes perhaps have not been separated, and which it is consequently prohibited to eat. If so, how can he move it, if it is unusable? – He can give up his possessions and become poor, and eat it with this subterfuge. He may also move lupines – a sort of beans –&nbsp;since they are fit for goats.

Shabbat 127 – Receiving guests

How do we know that? – From <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/02/shabbat-126-stopping-shabbat-rest.html">a previous ruling</a> that one may clear away boxes of straw for guests and students, with guests mentioned first.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Yehudah said, “Receiving guests is more important than communicating with God.” The proof? –  Abraham, who was having a prophetic vision, told God, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=18#P428">My Master, please wait till I greet the guests</a>.”<br />
<br />
There are six things for which a person receives a reward in this world, and this reward is only a dividend (fruit), but the main rewards still remains for him in the next world: receiving guests, visiting the sick, concentration in prayer, rising early to study Torah, raising his children to the study of Torah, and judging his fellow favorably.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud gives three examples of going to the extreme in judging a righteous man favorably, even when circumstances seem to indicate otherwise, but for regular people this does not apply, and favorable judgment is only required if the indications of good and bad intentions are equally weighed.

What's the story here? – On Shabbat, all animals were declared “not prepared,” or “muktzeh” by the Sages, out of the consideration that one may cut off a branch of a tree in order to hit a horse or another animal. However, rule #1 tells us that even though the basket becomes temporarily muktzeh itself, while a chick is on it, one may move it it order to help the chicks.
<br />
<br />
Rule #2: if a hen escaped from its house, we may push her back into it until she enters. Here too, although the animal is muktzeh, and in general it is forbidden to move the muktzeh or even a part of it, we may push her even with the hands, since otherwise she experiences distress and is exposed to injury.
<br />
<br />
Rule #3: a woman may help her young child walk by holding his arms from behind, provided that he can make a few steps and move, albeit with difficulty, by himself. Of course, the child is not muktzeh, however, here the concern might be that the mother will carry the child in the public area, which is forbidden. Therefore, rule #3 tells that helping a child who can somewhat help himself is allowed.

Some say that this requires excessive exertion, while others – that it represents the final step in birth, and making a final step in creating anything is forbidden Shabbat. However, one is allowed to help the animal to give birth, by grasping the young when it emerges, so that it does not fall to the ground. One may also blow into its nostrils to clear them of mucus and put a teat into its mouth so it would suckle.
<br />
<br />
For a woman that is giving birth one can take any necessary action, such as calling the midwife, traveling to a distant place, and later tying and cutting the umbilical cord. One may also perform all the requirements of circumcision.
<br />
<br />
During birth, one may light a lamp for her. – Of course one can, what's the news? – Even if the woman herself is blind and cannot derive benefit from light, still, since she feels better knowing that the light is on, it is allowed. One can make a large bonfire to warm up the woman, and even in hot summertime. The Talmud then describes the laws of bloodletting, which was a popular medical procedure.

<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/04/menachot-45-book-of-ezekiel.html">We learned before</a>&nbsp;about Chanina ben Chizkiyah who secluded himself for a very long time, in the attic of a house, to investigate the difficult passages in the book of Ezekiel. The Sages of both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel used to visit him, and on a specific day the students of Beit Shammai outnumbered those of Beit Hillel, seized the chance, took a vote, and promulgated the eighteen decrees, part of which we have already seen.
<br />
<br />
In addition, Chanina ben Chizkiyah and colleagues wrote the “Scroll of Fasts,” which listed the days on which fasts were prohibited because those days were declared minor celebrations, due to the miraculous salvations events that occurred on them. However, later, due to the many troubles and sufferings following the destruction of the Second Temple, most of these celebrations were abolished. They merited to do it, because they cherished sufferings that befell them, and therefore merited salvations. 
<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, “We too cherish sufferings and would like to record the dates of our deliverance, but the troubles are so many that we would not be able to celebrate all the corresponding festivals.” Some say, we are insensitive to both sufferings and deliverances.

If one forgot to bring a circumcision knife before Shabbat, then normally, since carrying anything in a public area is prohibited, he cannot bring this knife now. Bringing the knife is not a mitzvah per se, but only a preparation for it.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Eliezer argues against exactly this point. In his opinion, preparation for a mitzvah is just as important is the mitzvah itself. In fact, in the place of Rabbi Eliezer they would go so far as to fell trees to prepare charcoal to make a knife on Shabbat, for the purpose of the circumcision. And, even though for a Shabbat violation one gets cut off from his spiritual source and may have his life reduced, in the place of Rabbi Eliezer everybody would live out a long life.
<br />
<br />
When one, following Rabbi Eliezer, brings a knife on Shabbat, he should be showing it to everybody, to emphasize the love for the mitzvah. In the time of danger, when circumcision is prohibited, he can cover it, but do it in the presence of witnesses, so that the love for the mitzvah is still known.

Actually, Rabbi Eliezer allows this for most other mitzvot, with only two exception: tying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzitzit">tzitzit</a> on his garment and putting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezuzah">mezuzah</a> on his door. Why are these the exceptions? – Even though it is true that his garment may need a tzitzit, on Shabbat he may renounce the ownership of his garment or his house altogether, and thus temporarily avoid doing the mitzvah. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Eliezer allows to go and cut his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulav">lulav</a> on Shabbat, and to construct a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkah">sukkah</a> on Shabbat, in preparation for the holiday on Sunday – because the lulav must be taken “on that day,” and so also the sukkah must entered “on that day.” Granted, but why do we need to learn this law twice? The Torah should have taught us one of them, and we would derive the other!? – No, we can't do that. Lulav is special, because it requries three more species of plant to go with it, so we cannot learn the law of the sukkah from it. In turn, sukkah is special in that it is required both by day and by night, and therefore we cannot learn the law of the lulav from sukkah.

All agree that circumcision can be done on Shabbat, although one makes a wound. Rabbi Eliezer allows even preparations for the mitzvah to be done on Shabbat, and the Sages say that any preparation that can be done before Shabbat should be done then – this is the rule of Rabbi Akiva – but all agree on the basic fact. Why is that?
<br />
<br />
If you say that this is because the circumcision is called a “sign,” then I will answer that tefillin are also called a “sign,” and they are not worn on Shabbat. If you tell me that it is because circumcision is called a “covenant,” then why this “covenant” for an adult is not done on Shabbat? And if you say that it is because it is for “generations,” then why tzitzit, which is also “for generations,” not made on Shabbat? Rather, it is because circumcision is special in that it has all three of these terms applied to it.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yochanan found a simpler explanation. Since the Torah tells to perform circumcision “on the eighth day,” this means even if this falls out on Shabbat.

Shabbat 133 – All necessities of circumcision

First the outer foreskin is removed, and then the membrane is pulled back. Then one who performs the circumcision draws the blood – for otherwise the accumulated blood would cause danger – and afterward the dresses up the wound.
<br />
<br />
All of the these operations are required for proper circumcision and are permitted on Shabbat. If one did not prepare an ointment, he may do so – albeit in an unusual manner. If he did not prepare a bandage in the right shape, he may not do so now – but he can wrap a cloth around the wound. If he did not bring the cloth before Shabbat, he may even bring it on Shabbat – but only through courtyards, not through the streets where carrying is forbidden.

Shabbat 134 – Washing the baby

Therefore, the Sages permitted washing the baby with hot water, even though normally this is forbidden. Some say that even if the water was warmed on Shabbat itself, the washing is still permitted. However, it has to be done in an unusual manner, by splashing the water with a hand. Even pouring it from a vessel is not considered a sufficient deviation.
<br />
<br />
Moreover, the third day of the sickness is considered the hardest, and accordingly Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah permits washing the baby on Shabbat if this is the third day after the circumcision – because in the incident of Shechem “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=34#P1006">on the third day they were in pain</a>.” This, however, is not a complete proof but only a hint: perhaps on the third only the adults are in pain, because they heal slowly, but to infants, who heal faster, it does not apply.<br />

Shabbat 135 – Circumcision for an androgyne

Circumcision involves making a wound, which is prohibited on Shabbat, so it is done only for a definite male, and in this case it will happen a day later.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yehudah finds an indication in the Torah that androgyne is a special case and must be circumcised on Shabbat, if it is his&nbsp;eighth&nbsp;day. What is his source? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=17#P408">Circumcise <b>all</b> your males</a>,” and this extra word “all” includes the androgyne.

Shabbat 136 – How can we ever circumcise on Shabbat?

However, how could we really say so, if before thirty days it is still not certain that the child is a viable child!? Just look at the following ruling of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: any child that lives for thirty days is not suspected of being not viable, but before – it is, since <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4271">redemption of a first born child</a> applies only after thirty days, because then it is clear that the child is viable.<br />
<br />
Rav Adda bar Ahavah said that the answer is clear, whichever way you look at it: if it is a viable child, the Torah told to circumcise it, and if it is not, then he is simply cutting (dead) meat, which is also permitted on Shabbat. However, the last fact is not universally accepted: a non-viable child is compared to non-viable animal fetus, about which there is a disagreement whether it is considered alive for slaughter.
<br />
<br />
The son of Rav Dimi had a child born to him. Unfortunately, this child died before he was thirty days old, and the rule is that in such a case mourning is not required, because perhaps the child was not viable. However, the son of Rav Dimi sat in mourning. The custom was to serve very tasty food to mourners, to lift up their spirits, and Rav Dimi asked his son, “Do you simply want to eat the tasty morsels that they serve to mourners?” However, Rav Dimi's son answered him, “I know through other means that this was a viable child.”

Shabbat 137 – Transgressing while attempting a mitzvah

If one had two infants to circumcise, one on Shabbat and one on Sunday, but he made a mistake and circumcised the Sunday one on Shabbat – then, since he did not accomplish a mitzvah, he needs to bring a sacrifice.
<br />
<br />
If two infants were to be circumcised, one on Friday and another one on Shabbat, and by mistake he circumcised the Friday one, on Shabbat, then Rabbi Eliezer still holds him liable, but Rabbi Yehoshua says that he is not: since he tried to perform a mitzvah and ended up actually accomplishing it, albeit circumcising a day late, he should not be punished for his attempt.
<br />
<br />
An infant may be circumcised, depending upon the calendar, on the eighth through twelfth day. The last case occurs when he was born at dusk on Friday evening and, since it is not known whether dusk is part of the day before or the day after, circumcising him on the next Friday may be too early, but on Shabbat it is not allowed because it may be too late. If in addition the next two days are Rosh Hashana, then he will be circumcised after all holidays, on the twelfth day. Of course, if the child is sick, circumcision is postponed until he becomes healthy.

Shabbat 138 – Straining wine

Since enjoying wine is a mitzvah, Rabbi Eliezer allows to pour wine into a strainer, if it was set up before Shabbat. Setting it up in the first place would be prohibited though, either because he is building a temporary tent, or because it is too similar to his weekdays activities.
<br />
<br />
The Sages do not allow preparing for a mitzvah on Shabbat and therefore do not permit straining the wine. What if he violated the law and strained wine on Shabbat? Rabbah says that he is doing the prohibited labor of selecting (removing the dregs), while Rav Zeira says that he is liable for doing sifting. As a result of this disagreement, the court cannot stop him, because the witnesses would need to give a clear unambiguous explanation of the prohibition, and here they can't; however, if he did it by mistake, he will have to bring a sacrifice whichever reason applies.
<br />
<br />
Rav said that in the future the Torah will be forgotten from Israel, following the prophecy that “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=28#P5665">God will make extraordinary things, and the wisdom of the wise will perish</a>.” “Extraordinary” refers to Torah. But why should this be? If they forget the laws – let them learn the basics rulings, and if they forget the reasons – let them learn the Talmud! The answer is that the uncertainties like the above will plague them.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon said, “God forbid! The Torah will not be forgotten. Rather, there will not be a clear law (“Mishnah  Berurah” in Hebrew) to follow, and everybody will have his own opinion on which law to correct.”

Ulla said, “Redemption will come to Israel through charity, following Isaiah: '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1001.htm">Zion will be redeemed through justice and its people through charity</a>.'”<br />
<br />
The people of Bashkar sent three queries to Levi, but by the time the messenger arrived, Levi died. Shmuel then said to Rav Menashia, “If you are sufficiently wise, answer them.” The question was about putting up a canopy on Shabbat (which, if it has even a small a roof at its top, is akin to building), and the answer given was “I have reviewed all considerations and have not found ground to permit this.” But he could have suggested a canopy which rolls to the side with a rope!? This would be permitted because it is obviously not building but opening or closing, or because adding to a temporary tent is permitted, only building it is forbidden. – The Bashkarians were not learned Sages, and they could have adopted other&nbsp;leniences, basing them on this one. 
<br />
<br />
The second query was about planting – with the same result as the first, an extra stringent ruling. The third one was about burial on a Yom Tov holiday, and he told them that it was not allowed, either by a Jew or a non-Jew, either on the first or on the second day of the holiday. But there were other opinions that he could have followed!? Some allow burial by non-Jews on the second day, and others burial by non-Jews on the first day, and by Jews on the second! – Again, the Bashkarians were not learned Sages, and they could have adopted other leniencies, basing them on this one.

However, some of them have ramifications even today, when there is no Temple. Below are three of the eighteen.
<br />
<br />
One whose head and body enters drawn water (such as tap water or water brought in a pail) becomes ritually impure. That sounds upside-down: water makes impure. However, the reason for this is that people who did not have a proper clean mikveh to purify themselves used to immerse in a dirty stale water, naturally assembled in caves. While being a ritually valid mikveh, it would make one physically dirty, and he would then take a shower. Eventually, people starting thinking that the shower has the power to ritually purify a person, which was not true. There, if one cannot use the shower without loosing the effect of his prior immersion in a mikveh, this practice stops and the confusion is eliminated.
<br />
<br />
One who was not paying attention to his hands after he washed them last the time, being it for prayer or in the morning (pouring water on them alternatively three times) should assume that he has touched something ritually impure, and now he has to wash them again, before he touches a pure food, or before he prays.
<br />
<br />
If one who touches a Torah scroll with his hands, they becomes ritually impure. That seems counter-intuitive, but the reason is that people used to store the Torah scrolls and ritually pure foods together, thinking they both are holy. However, mice would find the food and would also eat the scroll. With this decree, people would not store them together any longer.

However, what kind of sorting is that? – One that separates the bad from the good, because this is similar to the work done while constructing the Tabernacle. However, one may put an egg into a mustard strainer – that same strainer that was <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/02/shabbat-138-straining-wine.html">prohibited in the case of wine</a>. Why? The mustard seeds in this case were already ground and strained before Shabbat and are found at the bottom of the strainer. The custom was to crack an egg in the strainer, so that the yolk would go down and color the mustard. The yolk just goes down and the albumen remains above. Since the albumen is not refuse but can be used, this is not sorting. And coloring the mustard is not prohibited since the prohibition of coloring does not apply to foods.
<br />
<br />
On the subject of food preparation, there was a bitter herb called asafetida, which people used to soak in water and drink for health reasons. This is prohibited on Shabbat because healing in general is prohibited – lest one comes to grind the medicine. However, if he soaks it in vinegar, then this is perfectly allowed: since it was a common condiment used at the table, one can eat it, even though it has a therapeutic effect.

All of these, however, have mystical connotations. For example, when Rav Chisda says that he did not eat much vegetables either when he was poor or when he was rich, he means being poor and rich in Torah knowledge. The reason not to indulge in vegetables was that to achieve the tikkun, correction of the souls that are reincarnated in a vegetable, one has to possess the power to elevate them two levels, in the hierarchy of plants-animals-man, whereas for meat one only has to achieve one-step elevation. Today the logic is reversed, and the adverse spiritual effect of meat on our bodies outweighs the needs of the tikkun, so that the student is advised to be vegetarian throughout the week, and eat meat or foul only on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
One may put food in front of an animal, but only if it is completely edible and does not have in it an admixture of dirt or remains of other animal's feeding – for then it would be muktzeh – something set aside from Shabbat use.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, if one has straw on his bed, he may not move it with his hand – because it is muktzeh – but he is allowed to lie down on it or move with his body – for unusual ways to move a muktzeh are permitted. If that straw qualifies as animal fodder, he can move it even with his hand.

Shabbat 142 – Son holds a stone

However, when his son holds a stone and refuses to drop it, one may pick his son up in his arms. But the father is then handling a muktzeh object!? – We are talking about a son who longs for his father and may get sick if his father won't pick him up. If so, why did we learn that one may pick his son with a stone in his hand but not with a dinar coin? – There is no contradiction here: if a coin falls out of the child's hand, the father may carry it and thus violate Shabbat, but if a stone falls out, the father will not carry it.
<br />
<br />
If there is money on a pillow, one may shake it off and use the pillow. That is true, however, only if he forgot the money on the pillow, but if he intended it to be there on Shabbat, then the pillow becomes muktzeh together with the money and may not be moved. 
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if that pillow became dirty, he may wipe it off with a rag, but not pour water over it, because pouring water alone constitutes prohibited washing. If the pillow is made of leather, he can even pour water, but not scrub – because leather is not washed by rinsing but by scrubbing.

Shabbat 143 – Bones left on the table
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhBVYq5nodJVzVZzTJI2kb1OVAZ1guCpgmz5lJ44njwVCj0X6p9_GyGN7DqbRqlpRIPkG1MV9p-JrpibexQx7Y62qbfOK9GLLhLB1Q2J4vakAKpq_z4vxmdwARBC6CdY2TVVpED1qCQ218/s1600/Fernando+Botero+-+Man+Drinking+Orange+Juice.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhBVYq5nodJVzVZzTJI2kb1OVAZ1guCpgmz5lJ44njwVCj0X6p9_GyGN7DqbRqlpRIPkG1MV9p-JrpibexQx7Y62qbfOK9GLLhLB1Q2J4vakAKpq_z4vxmdwARBC6CdY2TVVpED1qCQ218/s320/Fernando+Botero+-+Man+Drinking+Orange+Juice.jpg" width="320" /></a>After one eats a piece of meat and places the bone on the table, there is nothing that he can do with it, and the bone is now  muktzeh – set aside from Shabbat use. Neither may one move husks. All this is what one would logically expect, but Beit Shammai do not agree to it: rather they say that the prohibitions of muktzeh do not extend thus far. Beit Hillel, indeed, do not allow handing the bones and request one to shake them off them table by moving the table. 
<br />
<br />
How could the above be true? We know that Beit Shammai is usually more stringent than base Hillel, and here it is the reverse!? Indeed, Rav Nachman corrects the version: it is Beit Hillel who follow the more lenient view of Rabbi Shimon on muktzeh and allow moving the bones, while Beit Shammai forbid this.
<br />
<br />
One is not allowed to squeeze fruit for the juice.  If the juice oozed on its own, then it depends. If the fruit are stored for the juice, then there is a danger that after trying the liquid that oozed out by itself, one may be tempted to squeeze some more, and will thus violate Shabbat. However, if the fruit are normally stored for food, then one does not desire for more juice to come out. In this case one my drink the juice that oozed out by itself.

Shabbat 144 – Milk purity

What if the owner had no specific intention for his fruit? In elucidating this, the Talmud discussed the laws of milk.
<br />
<br />
The basic rule of food is that it <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/chullin-33-blood-of-shechitah-and.html">can becomes ritually impure only after it has been washed in a liquid</a>. This liquid can be woman's milk; whether the milk came out with the woman's knowledge and satisfaction (she wanted to feed her baby) or if it was unintentional. By comparison, cow's milk makes food susceptible to impurity only if the owner milked the cow, but not if it dripped by itself. 
<br />
<br />
This rule seems strange, and Rabbi Akiva objected: cow's milk has much wider use than the milk of a woman, and therefore it certainly should be able to prepare the food for impurity, even when it dripped by itself. And the Sages, who initially composed the rule, what do they answer? They say that a human is different and is more stringent in many respects, so you cannot derive laws from humans to animals. For example, human blood is also considered a beverage, based on the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=23#P4438">Blood of the slain he will drink.</a>” A person is usually slain against his will, and still his blood can prepare food for impurity; therefore the milk of a woman, even coming out against her will, has the same property. This is not true for animals.

Shabbat 15 – Shammai and Hillel argued no more than three times

What are they?
<br />
<br />
When making dough, one has to separate a portion for a priest (Kohen) and give it to him. Nowadays,  when the priests are no longer ritually pure, one separates and destroys a symbolic amount. How much dough is considered significant enough for separating the Kohen's portion, called challah? Shammai says that it is one kav (the volume of twenty-four eggs), while Hillel maintains that it is twice that amount, or two kavim. Both base their measurements on the amount of manna that the Jews would have for their meal in the desert, except that Shammai says that one meal forms this basis, and Hillel – that daily amount of manna, collected in the morning and then used for the two meals of the day, should be used in the calculation.
<br />
<br />
A mikveh is a pool of rainwater used for ritual purification. If some water is poured into it from a vessel, before it collects the required volume of rainwater, it becomes disqualified. How much poured water would disqualify it? Hillel says that it is a hin (faithfully using the word “hin”that his teaches used), or about a gallon (because one can wash himself in that), and Shammai is much more lenient and says that is it nine kavin, about four gallons (because this is enough for a shower). The other Sages are stricter than both and say that it is three lugs (about one quart). 
<br />
<br />
Their third disagreements was learned in the tractate Niddah <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">here</a>.<br />

Shabbat 16 – Glass vessels, what are they?

Since glassware is not mentioned anywhere in the Torah, it should not be susceptible to ritual impurity. However, the Sages did decree such impurity. Why? Rabbi Yochanan quoted his favorite student Resh Lakish: “Since its formation is from sand, the Sages placed it in the same category as earthenware – which is mentioned in the Torah and is susceptible to impurity, though only from the inside.”
<br />
<br />
But if that is true, glassware should not become impure when a source of impurity touches it on the outside, just like earthenware - and we know that it does!” – Glassware differs from earthenware in that if it is broken, it can be melted down and refashioned, which is not true of earthenware. In this it is similar to metalware, which does accept impurity when something touches it from the outside.  
<br />
<br />
If glass is indeed similar to metal, then flat glass utensils should accept impurity just like flat metal utensils do – and we know that this is not true about glass!? – The Sages, when they gave impurity to glassware, wanted to make it different from metal, to remind people that this impurity is only decreed by the Sages, and that when an impure glassware&nbsp;utensil&nbsp;touches ritually pure foods, these foods should not be burned on account of this. The Sages therefore gave glass the laws that are somewhat different from the laws of metal, to serve as such a reminder.<br />

Shabbat 17 – The other decrees of Beit Shammai

One concerns the laws of a mikveh and the rainwater collected into it, but the distinctions are made finer and finer. If one placed vessels under a gutter pipe, and later poured it into a the mikveh to complete it, this water is considered drawn by a human, not rainwater, and it&nbsp;disqualifies&nbsp;the mikveh. Beit Shammai further say that this disqualification is true even if he put the vessels there unintentionally or forgot them, but Beit Hillel say that then the water is valid. Rabbi Meir says that if he forgot the vessels in the middle of his courtyard, all agree that the water is valid. Some say that the argument is when he placed the vessels when the clouds were gathering, but then dispersed, he forgot about his vessels, and now the clouds gathered again and brought rain.
<br />
<br />
On that day the students of Shammai prevailed over Hillel with force. They stuck a sword in the meeting of the Sages and said, “Whoever wants to enter is welcome, but nobody is allowed to leave until the law is decided.” Hillel sat in front of Shammai like one of his students, and due to that his words were not listened to, and the day was as grievous to Israel as the day when the Golden Calf was made – because there too, people did not listen to Aaron and Hur.

In the same way, when putting bundles of flax into an oven to be bleached by the heat, one must give it sufficient time for bundles to become heated while it is yet day – again, these are the words of Beit Shammai, and Beit Hillel allow it.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, when one makes dough by pouring water onto flour, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that this is already considered kneading, while Rabbi Yose opines that “kneading” is only when one kneads the dough manually. Could it be that the rule above belongs to Rabbi Yehudah alone? – No, Rabbi Yose could agree about ink, because it is normal to knead dough, but not ink.
<br />
<br />
From where do Beit Shammai take the concept that one's vessels and machines should rest on Shabbat? – from the Torah phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2155">Be very careful to keep everything I have said to you</a>.” It follows the prohibition of work on Shabbat and adds an additional prohibition. And Beit Hillel? They say that this prohibition is not from the Torah. They do agree, however, that when a working machine makes noise and gives an appearance of working on Shabbat – such as an automatic mill – that it should not be used.

Shabbat 19 – Lest he stokes the coals

Why? – Because in his desire to eat the meal, one can stoke the fire. It follows from here that if the food in the pot is completely raw, then it is allowed to put it into the oven. And why is that? – Since one has no hope of eating it on Friday night anyway, one will not come to stoke the fire.
<br />
<br />
Prior to Shabbat, one should not sell any item to a non-Jew, or help him load it, because his subsequent carrying it home may seem as if he is doing this on the behest of a Jew – so say Beit Shammai – unless he can reach his home before Shabbat starts. However, Beit Hillel say that it is enough for him to be able to reach the first house in his town. Then, if he carries it to his home – that is his own affair.
<br />
<br />
One should not give clothing to a gentile launderer unless he has time to finish it while it is yet day – so say Beit Shammai, but Beit Hillel allow it – provided that the Jew does not ask for them right after Shabbat. In the household of Rabban Gamliel they would follow the stringency of Beit Shammai, while white clothes were given even more time – since they are harder to clean. Even though this is not the&nbsp;prevailing&nbsp;law, it does teach us about cleaning. Abaye once asked a launderer, “How much to clean the colored garment?” – and the launderer told him that it is the same as white ones. Abaye said to himself, “Talmud teaches that he is cheating!”

However, "<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-6.htm" target="_blank">and the people were restrained from bringing more</a>" refers to this. The people were not allowed to carry from their private domain into a public one, and it happened on Yom Kippur, which has the same laws as Shabbat.</p><p>For example, if a poor man is standing outside a house and a householder is inside - and if the poor man extends his hand with an object and places it into the hand of a householder - the poor man is liable for bringing the object in on Shabbat. Similarly, the poor man should not take objects out of the house.</p><p>Thus, there are two prohibited acts that the man can do while standing outside. However, if the poor man extends his hand inside, but now the householder takes the basket from him - since the poor man performed only half of the act - he has not violated Shabbat. The Sages prohibited it, nevertheless, to prevent him from doing a complete act.</p><p>Thus, the rule is that "there are two ways to violate Shabbat, which are really four" - two more were added by the Sages.</p><p>Art: Pittoco Sitting by Giacomo Ceruti</p>

Shabbat 20 – Lighting Shabbat Candles

As the first step, one lights a lamp, in order to conduct the Shabbat meal in a lighted room. Some say that the lamp is for enjoyment, since it is impossible to completely enjoy a meal in a dark house; others say that that the lamp or candles are to honor Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
Some materials should not be used for the lamp's wick, because they will not produce a steady even flame. The first one is the bark of a cedar tree. But it is just wood, unfit for a wick!? – There is wooly substance in the bark, called bast. Still, it is not good enough.
<br />
<br />
The next material unfit for a wick is uncarded flax. Flax stems are first soaked (retted) and then beaten (scutched) to break them apart and to release the fiber. The fibers are then separated (hackled, or carded). Before they are separated, flax does not draw oil well.
<br />
<br />
Another prohibited material is willow tree. Ravin and Abaye were once walking in the Tamrurita valley when the saw some willow trees. Ravin said to Abaye, “This is the will tree that we learned about, forbidden to be used as a wick on Shabbat.” Abaye replied to him, “But that is just a tree!” Ravin then peeled some bark off one of the tress and showed Abaye the wooly substance within.

Shabbat 21 – Oils unusable on Shabbat

The first one is the “kik” oil. What is it? Shmuel said, “I asked all the seafarers, and they told me that there is a bird found in seaport cities, and its name is 'kik', and it is oil made of that bird.” Rabbi Yitzhak said that it is cottonseed oil, but Resh Lakish maintains that it is oil of the tree under which the prophet Jonah rested, called “kikayon.” Rabbah bar bar Channah said, “I myself have seen Jonah's plant, and it grows in ponds, merchants hang it above their stores' entrances, its seeds produce oil, and under its branches rest all the sick of the Land of Israel.”
<br />
<br />
All the oils prohibited for use in Shabbat lamps are also prohibited for use in the Hanukkah menorah, on weekdays as well as on Shabbat – this is the opinion of Rav Huna. What is his reason? He maintains that the Hanukkah light needs to be rekindled if it goes out, and with those unfit oil the danger of him negligently forgetting to rekindle is too great.
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda says that these oils may be used for Hanukkah on weekdays but not on Shabbat. Why? According to him, one does not need to re-light the menorah. Thus, weekdays with imperfect oil are not a problem. On Shabbat, however, one may tilt the lamp to improve the light, for example, for reading – which may happen, because Rav Chisda does permit to use the lights of Hanukkah for personal needs.
<br />
<br />
Finally, Rav permits these oils for the menorah for all days. On weekdays it is not a problem, because Rav does not require him to rekindle the light if it goes out. On Shabbat it is not a problem either, because Rav does not allow to use the light of Hanukkah for personal need, and thus one will not come to tilt the lamp.

Shabbat 22 – Hanukkah

This is the only mention of Hanukkah in the Talmud.&nbsp;What is the reason for Hanukkah? When the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they contaminated all the flasks of oil that were there. When the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasmonean_dynasty">Hasmoneans</a> gained the upper hand, they searched and found only one flask of oil, with the seal of the High Priest still intact. It contained enough oil for one day. However, a miracle was performed with this oil, and they kindled the lights of the Menorah with it for eight days, until other ritually pure oil could be obtained. The following year the Hasmoneans and the Sanhedrin established these eights days as festival days, to praise God for the miracle.<br />
<br />
Can we derive a Hanukkah law from the following law of damages: if a camel laden with flax was passing through the street, and his flax protruded into a shop where it caught fire from the shopkeeper's lamp, and then the burning flax set fire to a mansion - the camel driver is liable. If the shopkeeper has set his lamp outside, then the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Yehudah adds that if it was a Hanukkah light, even outside, the shopkeeper is not liable, since it is a mitzvah to light the Hanukkah lamp outside, to publicize the miracle. On analysis, we see that a Hanukkah light must be placed within ten&nbsp;hand-breadths&nbsp;above the&nbsp;ground&nbsp; because if it were allowed to be placed higher, the camel driver could have this winning claim: “You should have put your Hanukkah lamp higher than a camel!” – Not necessarily, since if the law would require a shopkeeper to put the lamp that high, he might not have lighted it altogether.

Shabbat 23 – Being above suspicion

For example, there is a rule that if one was standing and holding his menorah all the required time, he accomplished absolutely nothing. But he kindled it and it was burning! Do we see from here that placing the lamp is essential, and that is what he failed to do? – Not necessarily. Here the problem is that those who see him might say, “He needs the light for his own needs,” and he thus fails to publicize the miracle.
<br />
<br />
Let us now try to prove the opposite, from Rava's rule that if one kindled the lights at home and then placed the menorah outside, he has accomplished nothing; it must be then that placement is not the mitzvah, but kindling the menorah in its place is essential?! – No, there is no proof from here either, because the one who sees may think that he just needs the light, thus the miracle is not publicized.
<br />
<br />
The conclusion though is that kindling is essential, and that is the text of the blessing, “...to kindle the lights of Hanukkah”.
<br />
<br />
If one has a house with two doors on the two opposite sides, he must light two menorahs, one on each side, to avoid the suspicion of being negligent. What is the source that tells us to care about people's suspicion? – It is the law of “pe'ah,” the corners of the field –&nbsp;which the field's owner must leave over for the poor. One must leave standing stalks at the end of reaping, since if he were to do so any time during his harvest, the passerby– seeing an empty field at the end of the harvest –&nbsp;might say, “Let a curse come over one who does not leave over corners of his field for the poor.”

Shabbat 24 – Shabbat or Hanukkah, which is more important?

Do we say that Shabbat comes first, because of the rule that something that is more frequent takes precedence? Or do we say that Hanukkah light is more important, because it publicizes the miracle?” He then resolved it himself: one should buy oil for one Hanukkah light, which is sufficient to publicize the miracle, and spend the rest on wine.
<br />
<br />
Rav Huna gave a series of omens. One who is habitual to light Shabbat and Hanukkah candles will merit children who are Torah scholars, (based on “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2806.htm">mitzvah is lamp and Torah is light</a>”). One who is careful with the mezuzah will merit a beautiful residence. One who is careful about tzitzit will merit a beautiful garment. One who is careful to say the Shabbat Kiddush on wine will merit to fill many kegs of wine.

What is this oil designated for burning and why one can't use it? It is oil of terumah, or kohen's portion, which must be kept in ritual purity, but which has become ritually impure. Such oil cannot be used for food and must be burned.  Why then not use it for Shabbat? – Because the Torah told not to burn such oil on a Yom Tov.
<br />
<br />
Where did the Torah say so? Talking about a Passover sacrifice, it says, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1827">Don't leave any of it until morning, and what is left of it until morning should be burned in fire</a>.” The word “morning” is repeated because it is refers not to the morning after Passover nigh, which is still a Yom Tov, but to the next morning, which is already a weekday, and only then can unfit sacrifice be burned. We learn from here a general rule of not burning unfit holy items on a Yom Tov. Another way to explain this is that only that which is to be eaten by people on a Yom Tov itself can be put on fire, but anything which can be burned later should be burned later.
<br />
<br />
The prophet Jeremiah says, “My soul despaired of having peace, I have forgotten goodness.” To what does this refer? - To his not having oil for Shabbat lamp. Others say he means a bathhouse before Shabbat. Still others say that it refers to a nice bed and nice bedclothes, and to an adorned wife.

Shabbat 26 – Oils for Shabbat lamp

This includes sesame oil, nut oil, radish oil, fish oil, watermelon oil, the aforementioned “itran”, and naphtha, another derivative of pitch.
<br />
<br />
In addition, one should not kindle the Shabbat light with balsam. It is volatile, and should not be used even on weekdays, but on Shabbat there is a danger that he will use some of it from the lamp, thus indirectly extinguishing the light.
<br />
<br />
There was one a mother-in-law who hated her daughter-in-law. She told her, “Go anoint yourself with balsam oil.” She then told her, “Go and light the lamp.” The girl dutifully went to lit the lamp, the fire leapt out and consumed her.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Tarfon wanted to declare only olive oil valid for Shabbat lamp, but Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri rose to his feet and said to Rabbi Tardon,  “What shall the Babylonians do, who have only sesame oil? And what shall the Medians do, who have only nut oil? And what shall the Alexandrians do, who have only radish oil? Rather, do not add to any oils that are already prohibited by the Sages.”

Shabbat 27 – A small piece of clothing

It does not have complete utility though, since rich people don't have any use for such small clothing. Nevertheless, the Torah gives it the status of a garment, and it is subject to the spiritual disease of tzaraat (white spots looking like leprosy), which indicates to the owner that he has some defects: &nbsp;stinginess, bad talk, etc.. How do we know that this indeed is the minimal size?
<br />
<br />
Since the Torah did not just say “garment” but “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=13#P3097">and the garment</a>”, we see that even a piece of three by three finger-breadths is included. But maybe the Torah meant a larger piece of clothing, three by three hand-breadths, which has some use for everybody, rich and poor? – No, that the Torah did not have to include, because it already included the warp and the woof, in that they can become impure: if such small unfinished piece is susceptible to impurity, then how much more so a finished piece of three by three hand-breadths! 
<br />
<br />
But perhaps Torah wanted to include garments made of other materials, and not only the wool and linen which it mentioned explicitly? – No, by repeating the word “garment” in “garment of wool or garment of linen,” the Torah showed that only these materials are considered significant for the laws of tzaraat purity.

Shabbat 28 – Wick made of wood

Incidentally, materials coming from a tree, if used to construct a roof over a dead body, do not themselves become ritually impure – again, with the exception of flax.
<br />
<br />
This terse rule can be explained as follows. Ordinarily, flax is not considered wood, but it is called “wood” once, in the book of Joshua, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0602.htm">And she brought them up to the roof and hid them in the trees of flax...</a>”. Since flax can be used for a wick, and since it does accept ritual impurity, it had to be mentioned and excluded.
<br />
<br />
The law of the wooden roof not accepting ritual impurity of the dead – although it transmits this impurity to other objects – is derived from the laws of the covering of the Tabernacle. A related  question is the skin of an animal called <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=25#P2198">“tachash,” also translated as “blue processed skin”</a> – was it a kosher animal or not. It had one horn, and therefore should have been kosher, since we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-51-one-but-not-other-wool-and.html">learned in the tractate Niddah</a> that this is a  sign of a kosher animal. Besides, the ox that Adam brought as a sacrifice, also had one horn, and it definitely was kosher. However, it could be that the unicorn called tachash was a special creature that appeared just once, to provide skins for the Tabernacle (it was multicolored, “&nbsp;joyous&nbsp;in his colors” in Aramaic), but then was hidden again, and its kosher status remains in doubt.

Shabbat 29 – A folded garment

According to Rabbi Eliezer, merely folding a garment into a wick does not change the fact that it is a garment; additional singeing would make it into a wick, and it would not accept ritual impurity any longer. Rabbi Akiva, however, says that folding a garment does make it into a complete wick, and it is not susceptible to impurity.
<br />
<br />
They further argue if one can actually light this wick for Shabbat, Rabbi Eliezer stating that one may not, and Rabbi Akiva – that one may. Why would one not be allowed to light it? We must say that they argue only in the case when Friday is a Yom Tov. Still, why we would not use the wick? – While it is still three by three finger-breadths, it is a “complete garment,” or at least usable for a patch. Once it starts burning, it becomes less than the minimal size, and thus it is something new that was created on a Yom Tov. According to Rabbi Eliezer, there is a prohibition to use broken pieces of utensils, because they are new entities, not designated initially for use. Such entities are called “set aside,” or “muktzeh” and that is why the wick cannot be used. The Talmud give two more possible explanations of their disagreement.

Shabbat 30 – The book of Ecclesiastes

However, Rabbi Yehudah says that people will be careful and not draw oil from the eggshell, so the decree is not needed. Everybody agrees that if the eggshell is part of the lamp, putting oil in it is allowed, since people will then definitely know not to take oil from there.
<br />
<br />
If one fears bandits, he still may not extinguish the Shabbat lamp, but if he did so, he has not transgressed the Torah. The same is true if he needs to extinguish it so that a sick person would sleep. If he&nbsp;extinguishes&nbsp;the lamp to save the oil, he is liable. However, Rabbi Yose says that extinguishing is not a constructive labor to be liable for it on Shabbat, and that he is liable only if he wants to improve the wick by charring it for the next time.
<br />
<br />
They asked Rabbi Tanchum a related question: "Granted that one is not liable, but is one allowed to extinguish the lamp for a seriously ill person?" Since this happened in a public lecture, Rabbi Tanchum first spoke about the wisdom of king Solomon, who seemingly contradicted his father David and also himself. David said, “Dead don't praise God,” while Solomon said, “I praise the dead... more than the living,” but also “A live dog is better than a dead lion.” However, he explained.
<br />
<br />
“Dead don't praise God” – because they cannot study the Torah, pray, or do good deeds. However, “I praise dead” refers to the righteous having more power after they die than while they lived.<br />
<br />
"A live dog is better than a dead lion” refers to the day when his father David (a lion) died. This happened on Shabbat, and a dead body on Shabbat is "muktzeh," "set aside," which cannot be handled. Besides, David's dogs were hungry, so Solomon asked the Sages what to do. They allowed Solomon&nbsp;to carry David's body in an unusual way, by placing on it a child or a loaf of bread. For the dogs, however, they allowed to cut the meat in the usual way.<br />
<br />
As far as the question that he was asked initially, Rabbi Tanchum answered (based on Solomon's Proverbs): “A person's soul is also called a candle. Better extinguish the physical candle than the spiritual one, fashioned by God.”<br />

Shabbat 31 - Shammai and Hillel

Once two people made a bet if one of them could anger Hillel. The man came to Hillel on Friday afternoon when Hillel was washing his hair for Shabbat. He screamed, "Is there a Hillel there?" Hillel put on his cloak and said, "My son, what do you seek?" The man said, "I have a question, why are the heads of Babylonians oval?" Hillel answered, "This is a great question! Because they don't have skillful midwives." The man returned two more times with similar questions but could not anger Hillel. Finally, he confessed that he lost a large amount of money. Hillel told him, "One should always guard his temper. It is better to lose money, but Hillel will not take offense."
<br />
<br />
A prospective convert came to Shammai and asked him, "How many Torahs do you have?" Shammai answered, "Two, one in writing and one oral, transmitted from teacher to student." The man said, "I will accept only the written one," and Shammai drove him away. However, Hillel converted him and started teaching him the alphabet, aleph, bet, etc. The next day Hillel told him that bet was aleph and aleph was bet. The man said, "But yesterday you taught me otherwise!" Hillel told him, "You see, you rely on my words anyway, so accept the rest of my words."
<br />
<br />
Another time a man wanted Shammai to teach him the complete Torah while the man would stand on one foot. Shammai refused, but Hillel told him, "Don't do to others what would be hateful to you, and now go and learn the rest of the details."
<br />
<br />
Another man came to Shammai to be converted because he will be appointed High Priest, but Shammai drove him away. Hillel, however, converted him and said, "Now you need to know the laws of the ceremony." As the man was learning, he saw that any non-kohen, even King David, would be liable to death by the hand of Heaven if he served in the Temple. He told Shammai, "Why didn't you explain this to me?" and to Hillel, he said, "Let the blessing come upon you, for you brought me to the knowledge of God."
<br />
<br />Later the three men met. They said, "The sternness of Shammai sought to drive us away from  true devotion, but the humble and patient manner of Hillel brought us under the wings of divine presence."

Shabbat 32 – Protective merits of a person

Why are these special? Niddah is naturally connected to childbirth; challah is connected to anything that is first, and Adam was the first; and human soul is called a candle. 
<br />
<br />
In general, one goes through life unimpeded, but his merits are weighted in the time of danger. For a man this means going over a shaky bridge, or any similar dangerous circumstance. As an illustration, Rav would not pass over a bridge on which an idolater was sitting – Rav felt that his merits might be insufficient to save him, if the judgment was visited on the idolater. Shmuel, on the other hand, would not pass a bridge where an idolater was not sitting – his reasoning was that either idolater has bad luck or Shmuel, but not both at once. Rabbi Yannai would check a boat for leaks and then cross. His logic was that one should not rely on miracles. If he is then saved from danger, it looks as if it happened due to natural causes, and even if a miracle is performed, this is undesirable, because it deducts from his account of good deeds.
<br />
<br />
For the same reason, one should always pray to continue being healthy: maintaining the healthy status quo requires comparatively little merit, but being saved from serious illness is tantamount to a miracle. If one goes to a marketplace, it should appear in his eyes as if he goes to trial; if he has a minor headache, he should think that he is put in chains; if he is sick, he should think that he is judged; however, his powerful advocates are his good deeds, and even one good deed speaks up against a thousand bad ones.

Shabbat 33 – Rewards – and punishments
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUl1SyA50pgguhyxJOL7ORYuzRAkEjN9dWdESmVCqXo2Pa7zwoY_LR9Pimk5FMvqVe3JkNXwCn2dOWOXBfNK9oKNSt8h41Vk5cYmALYvz4J9a5jzzwHf6SE_DZqTaQ2Tveyr9te8UkbM70/s1600/Charles+Haigh-Wood+-+The+Peace+Offering.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUl1SyA50pgguhyxJOL7ORYuzRAkEjN9dWdESmVCqXo2Pa7zwoY_LR9Pimk5FMvqVe3JkNXwCn2dOWOXBfNK9oKNSt8h41Vk5cYmALYvz4J9a5jzzwHf6SE_DZqTaQ2Tveyr9te8UkbM70/s320/Charles+Haigh-Wood+-+The+Peace+Offering.jpg" width="262" /></a>The Talmud lists various behaviors leading to beneficial results. While it is true that individual’s rewards may seem incomprehensible, because they are complicated by his previous lives’ acts, and by the idea that a reward may be given to a person in this world to repay him for the few good deeds he has done, good acts add to his balance, nation’s balance, and the world’s balance.
<br />
<br />
When one hates others for no reason, not because they have committed reprehensible acts, but just because he does not like them, he does not have peace in his own household. This is logical: since he does not want peace for others, he is deprived of it himself. Conversely, when he genuinely loves others, he is rewarded with peace and long life in his family.<br />
<br />
If people are not charitable, if they withhold what is due the kohen’s and the poor, skies are withheld from giving due and rain, prices increase, and men run after their livelihood but fail to achieve it. Conversely, a charitable nation is blessed with wealth. The source for this is in Job: “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2724.htm">The dry and the warm season steal the waters of the dry season</a>.” What is the connection? – Because of things that are done in warm season, that is, separation of the kohen’s and poor people’s portions from the crop – if it is not done – the waters of snow will be stolen from you in winter, the time of beneficial rains in Israel. For charitable behavior, one is promised a blessing “without limit,” literally, “without enough”, which mean that his lips will tire of saying “enough.”
<br />
<br />
Other important practices include speedy and fair judgments, not being attracted to robbery and murder, faithfulness and trust.<br />

Shimon ben Geirim told this to a friend, and eventually his words reached the Romans, who dealt with each Sage according to his words. Rabbi Shimon was to be put to death, and he hid in a cave with his son Elazar. Miraculously a caper bush grew there to sustain them. After thirteen years of studying Torah in this cave they emerged, but they were so upset to see people running after material and not spiritual pursuits that everything they looked upon would burn, so they were commanded to go back. A year later they emerged again, and now whatever Rabbi Elazar was destroying his father was repairing. Finally, Rabbi Shimon told his son, “When you and I learn Torah, this is enough for the world, leave others at rest.”
<br />
<br />
Then Rabbi Shimon said, “Since a miracle happened with me, let me do something for the community.” They told him that a large fields was impassable for the kohanim, because a grave was lost there. One elder told Rabbi Shimon that he remembered a place where Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai harvested beans in ritual purity. Rabbi Shimon did the same, and the corpse miraculously rose to the surface, after which Rabbi Shimon marked of this area as impure, and the rest as pure. The elder then mocked him. Rabbi Shimon said to him, “You were with us in this advice. Even harlots make braids for each other, and help their competitors (because collectively they can command a higher price), so the Sages should not bicker!” Rabbi Shimon set his eyes on the elder, and he died. 
<br />
<br />
They then saw Yehudah ben Geirim in the marketplace. Rabbi Shimon asked in surprise, “He is still in the world?” Rabbi Shimon set his eyes on him, and he turned in a heap of bones.
<br />
<br />
Here are three things that a man should say in his household on Friday afternoon before dark: Have you tithed, to make our food permitted on Shabbat? Have you made an eruv (food placed at a distance, for one to be allowed to walk there)? Please – light the Shabbat candles!”

Shabbat 35 – Twilight

At this time, one should not separate the tithes from his produce. Ordinarily, one is allowed snacks before he separates tithes, but not a complete sit-down meal. However, on Shabbat even snacks have a feeling of restful unhurried meals, and thus untithed produce cannot be eaten at all. Even though tithing is not really work, it is prohibited by the Sages because it is too similar to a repair: the food was not allowed to be eaten, and now – it is! Neither should one dip his dishes in a mikveh to purify them at this time – again, because it is similar to repairing them.
<br />
<br />
Those types of work that are only prohibited by the Sages and are too far removed from actual Shabbat violation can be done at twilight – such as, for example, wrapping the food to keep it warm. Why would wrapping not be allowed on Shabbat itself? Because one might find that the dish has cooled off somewhat, and warm it before wrapping, and that would be the prohibited labor of cooking. If so, we should not permit it even during twilight!? – No, during twilight all dishes are piping hot, so he will not warm them up.
<br />
<br />
How long is twilight? There are many possible definitions, ranging from the time it takes a person to walk 8,000 steps, all the way down to a moment so short that one cannot determine it.
<br />
<br />
If one has performed work at twilight both on Friday and on Saturday afternoons, he has to bring one sacrifice, regardless of how you look at it: if twilight is still day, he is liable for working during twilight on Shabbat, and if it is night, then he is liable for work done at twilight on Friday.

About an hour before Shabbat they would sound the first one, to top the people from performing their labor in the fields, giving them enough time to journey back to town before Shabbat. Those working in the nearby fields were not permitted to enter the town, until those who were farther away came as well. They would all enter at once, so that those working later were not suspected of working after the shofar blast. The store in the town would still be open.
<br />
<br />
At the second blast the storeowners would shutter the windows and lock the stores. At the third blast people would finish their hot food preparation and stared lighting the Shabbat candles. Then one blew another long note (tekiah), a series of short notes (teruah), and another long note. The sexton had hidden place on the top of his roof where he would leave the shofar, in order not to carry it on Shabbat.

Shabbat 37 – Shabbat stoves

The two-pot oven is called kirah, and it produces the least amount of heat of the three types. Our modern ovens are mostly comparable to this kirah.
<br />
<br />
If one heated the two-pot oven (kirah) with straw or stubble, usually there are no coals and little residual heat. Therefore, one may place cooked food upon it before Shabbat. That rule, however, if subject to further disagreements: does the word “place” means that one can leave the food there at the advent of Shabbat, or does it mean that he can even return it back after he has taken the food off on Shabbat itself? Furthermore, “cooked” does not mean that it is completely cooked, but only that a certain bandit called “Ben Drusai” who always ate his food one-third cooked, would eat it. However, there is another disagreement about food which is already cooked, but which further improves with additional cooking. The question here is can one leave this type of food on the oven, and which foods are of this type. If the oven was heated by wood, one needs to first shovel away the coals or cover them with ash. Otherwise there is a danger that he will stoke the fire.
<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai further argue with the circumstances of this rule. According to them, it is talking only about hot water but not cooked food, and it discusses only leaving the food on the stove but not returning it; Beit Hillel disagree on both counts.

Shabbat 38 – Putting the food back

However, here appears another concern – that it may look as if he is cooking on Shabbat. Nevertheless, this is allowed not only on Friday night, but even on the morrow, on the Shabbat day itself – so taught Rav Sheshet. 
<br />
<br />
However, there are a few provisos. The food must be still warm. Our returning it on the stove is a continuation of originally leaving it there, in order to keep it warm, and if it completely cooled off, then this reason does not work. Should the pot still be in his hands? Rav Dimi and Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah disagreed about that, and therefore it is better to keep it in one’s hands while serving the food. Should one have the intention to return it, when he takes the pot? Again, here we have different versions of the ruling, and therefore it is better to keep in mind that one will return the food to the stove. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Yirmiyah asked the following questions: if he hung the pot on a peg, what is the law? Is it like holding it in one’s hand, or is it like putting it on the ground? If he put it down on the bed, what then? Rav Ashi asked, “If he transferred the hot water from one kettle to another, can he return it to the stove?” These questions remained unanswered.

<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if one spread out cloth in the sun, he may try to fry eggs there, and, being that this is not a normal way of cooking with fire, it should be allowed. Nevertheless, the author of this ruling (usually the anonymous author is Rabbi Meir) forbids it – and Rabbi Yose allows it. What are their reasons? Both agree that cooking with fire derivatives (kettle) is forbidden. Both also agree that cooking in the sun is allowed, since this is unusual, and one cannot derive any wrong lessons seeing that someone cooks food in the rays of sun on Shabbat. Where they disagree is cooking with the derivatives of the heat of the sun (cloth spread out in the sun). Rabbi Meir says that it is forbidden, so that one should not come to cook with the kettle taken off the fire, while Rabbi Yose says that no one will confuse it, and therefore the additional prohibitions are unneeded.

Shabbat 40 – Shabbat bath

They reasoned that since the underground springs are naturally hot and are not heated by human effort, and additionally since they had constructed the pipes during weekday, they should be allowed to use the clean hot water. However, the Sages told them that if the water passed through the pipes on Shabbat, then it had the laws of water heated on Shabbat, and was prohibited for both washing and drinking; and if the water passed through the pipes on a festival (Yom Tov), when cooking is allowed, then the water was allowed for drinking, but still not for washing oneself.
<br />
<br />
What is the reason behind this prohibition? Initially taking a hot bath on Shabbat, using water heated before Shabbat, was completely allowed. However, the bathhouse owners started heating water on Shabbat and saying that they heated it before. The Sages then forbade washing in any hot water on Shabbat. People kept washing on Shabbat, claiming that they used Tiberius springs. The Sages forbade using Tiberius springs, but the populace could not abide by it, so the Sages reversed this decree, but kept the other ones in place.
<br />
<br />
What kind of bath is meant? Rav said – washing the whole body, but washing one limb at a time is allowed, and Shmuel said that even that is not allowed. They asked Rav quoting a well-known rule that “only washing one’s hands and feet is allowed,” but he answered that this rule really means any washing similar to hands and feet, and thus washing individual limbs is really allowed, just as he had said.  But the law here follows Shmuel.

The Sages forbade swimming in lakes and rivers on Shabbat, lest one come to make a flotation device, and this refers even to pools!? Rav Zeira did not know if this refers to pools without embankments, which are more similar to lakes, or even to pools with embankments. The Talmud discusses two more instances of Rav Abbahu’s behavior about which Rav Zeira was not sure.
<br />
<br />
When Rav Zeira was planning to go live in Israel, he avoided Rav Yehudah, because Rav Yehudah forbade leaving the Diaspora and moving to Israel, until God makes it so. His reason was the phrase from prophet Jeremiah, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1127.htm">I will bring you to Babylon, and there you will stay</a>”. However, as Rav Zeira craved the teachings of Rav Yehudah, he sneaked to listen from behind the bathhouse, where he heard Rav Yehudah say in Hebrew, “Please bring me soap and a brush,” and then continue in Aramaic, talking to his attendants, “Drink some of the hot water of the bathtub.” Rav Zeira deduced from here that one is permitted to talk about daily matters in Hebrew in a bathtub, and that it is beneficial to drink hot liquid while in a bathtub. Incidentally, one who leaves the bathtub and does not rinse himself in cold water is similar to metal that has been heated but not put into cold water for hardening. Rav Zeira then said, “Had I come to hear only these things, it would be enough.” Some say, he meant, “Had I only been born.”
<br />
<br />
One can drink hot water from a samovar from which hot coals have been removed – if the coals are on the inside of the samovar.  However, if its coals are in a large compartment on the outer sides of the samovar, then this compartment keeps adding heat throughout Shabbat, and drinking this water is forbidden.

Shabbat 42 – From the frying pan into the fire

When one pours hot water into cold water, we have this question: does the hot water cook the cold water (which would be forbidden), or does the cold water cool the hot water (and it’s allowed). Here we apply the universal principle that “the lower one rules,” with the result that pouring into cold water is permitted, but not the other way around. The Talmud makes further distinctions regarding the relative amounts of water.
<br />
<br />
When one removes a boiling pan from fire (usually right before Shabbat), the pan is hot. Its heat is considered the extension of the fire itself, and the pan is called “the first degree from fire.” This pan can therefore cook the food put into it, as if it were still on the stove. Consequently, one should not put spices into it, because he would then be cooking spices on Shabbat. However, once he serves the food in a plate, the plate is only “second degree from fire,” and one can safely add any spices he wants.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef wanted to say that salt has the same law as spices, but Rav Nachman told him, “Salt needs as much cooking as the meat of an ox,” that is, salt can be cooked only the hottest of the pots, and it is thus no problem putting salt into a hot pan removed from fire.

Why not? – The oil in the lamp is designated to be burned on Shabbat, and it is not designated for consumption. Therefore, the oil is considered “not prepared for use,” or “muktzeh”, and muktzeh objects cannot be handled or used on Shabbat. When one puts a plate to collect the oil, he effectively “cements” the plate to the floor: since the plate with the muktzeh oil may be not carried any longer, it is as if glued to the floor, and he has thus performed the prohibited labor of building on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
Another possible explanation is that he would be moving a non-muktzeh object (plate) for the sake of a muktzeh object (oil), and that too would be prohibited. However, that question, can one move a non-muktzeh object for the sake of a muktzeh object, is itself a subject of disagreement. Let's look at a couple examples.
<br />
<br />
One may want to put a basket under a hen, so that its egg would not fall and break on Shabbat. That, however, is prohibited, just as putting a plate under dripping oil. However, one can put an overturned basket to cover the egg, even though this is using a permitted object for the sake of forbidden. Can we thus use permitted objects for the sake of muktzeh? – No, this is a special dispensation, to prevent a commonly occurring loss.
<br />
<br />
If a dead body is lying in the sun on Shabbat, two people can come and sit by its sides. When it gets hot for them, they bring mats and sit on them. This establishes that they care for the themselves, not for the dead. Then, if it is still hot, they can bring a tent and place it over themselves (and the dead). Then they can leave, and the dead is protected. Are we using a permitted object for the sake a muktzeh (corpse)? – No, they use it for themselves. Then do we see that moving a permitted object for the sake of a muktzeh is NOT allowed? – Really, it is, but the procedure with the corpse also became law.

Shabbat 44 – A new lamp, but not the old one
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgonhyuD4txmrrGbgLOoByN-hCTZqelVOETdJNLSSoVlUCeebjRryXJCxgeuHhCZy80sZm_5CazMsbrNzJAEi_oHAl4qBqltieL5N3Z8A5VDMgW1wVPHorCZG6Vs-brKW4aCp0ojpQfF-rA/s1600/Gerrit+Dou+-+A+young+woman+with+a+lamp.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgonhyuD4txmrrGbgLOoByN-hCTZqelVOETdJNLSSoVlUCeebjRryXJCxgeuHhCZy80sZm_5CazMsbrNzJAEi_oHAl4qBqltieL5N3Z8A5VDMgW1wVPHorCZG6Vs-brKW4aCp0ojpQfF-rA/s320/Gerrit+Dou+-+A+young+woman+with+a+lamp.jpg" width="250" /></a>A new clean lamp may be handled on Shabbat. Since one can use it for something else, like storing objects, it is not considered, “muktzeh,” or set aside.&nbsp;However, once it has been used, it becomes dirty, and one cannot store anything in it. True, it is usable as a lamp, but kindling it is exactly what is prohibited on Shabbat. It follows then that a used lamp may not be handled on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
The above is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who takes the concept of muktzeh very expansively. Rabbi Shimon, however, permits all lamps to be moved on Shabbat, &nbsp;except for the one that is actually burning on Shabbat – lest he extinguish the flame.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir's is an in-between opinion: if the lamp was burning when Shabbat started on Friday night, it remains muktzeh even when the flame goes out, and should not be handled the whole day. Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Shimon takes the opinion of his father further, and he permits carrying a lamp that is actually burning. One just have to be careful not to extinguish it.
<br />
<br />
How could there be such a difference of opinions on the laws of muktzeh? When the law was formulated by the Sages, it was unambiguous! Even the eventual loss in the learning capacity over the generations could not explain such a variety?! – True, and when the law was initially formulated, it was the most strict version. However, it was not accepted by the majority of the people, and was later repealed, and the argument is how far did this process reach.<br />

Shabbat 45 – The right approach to muktzeh

We also saw that Rabbi Yehudah extends this prohibition to many more situations than does Rabbi Shimon. How did this disagreement progress throughout the generations?
<br />
<br />
For example, Rav said that if someone designated a bed for storing money on, and then actually placed money there, then it becomes a “money bed,” and it should not be moved on Shabbat, even if he later removed that money. However, if he did not designate it for use with money, then if there is money on it on Shabbat, he should not move it, but if there is no money there, then he can move it – provided that there was no money there at twilight on Friday.  That sounds very restrictive. The mere presence of money on the bed at twilight makes the bed muktzeh for the whole Shabbat!<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we learned a rule about a wooden bed, in the laws of purity, and there it was allowed to drag a bed on wheels on Shabbat, as long as there was no money on it – even if money was there at twilight. So how could Rav say his rule, in view of this more lenient approach to the “money bed?” – The answer is that first rule of Rav follows the more stringent approach of Rabbi Yehudah, whereas the latter rule about a wooden bed follows the less restrictive view, belonging to Rabbi Shimon. We thus see that Rav inclined toward the stricter view of Rabbi Yehudah, with its broader muktzeh prohibitions.

Shabbat 46 – Finer distinctions in muktzeh

When Rav Yitzhak arrived from Israel, he said, “Rabbi Yochanan agrees with the stricter, more inclusive prohibitions of Rabbi Yehudah on muktzeh.” At this, Rav Yosef exclaimed, “Now I understand the previous report!” For Rabbi Yochanan had said, “They (my colleagues) hold that the law agrees with the less strict opinion of Rabbi Shimon.” Now Rav Yosef understood that it meant, “They hold so, but I (Rabbi Yochanan) don't agree to it!”
<br />
<br />
At this, Abaye said to Rav Yosef, “How come you did not deduce this on your own!? For when Rabbi Assi, a choice student of Rabbi Yochanan, came to Rabbi Abba's house on Shabbat, a candelabra fell on his cloak, and he did not move it! That can only agree with the strict opinion on muktzeh, and surely Rabbi Assi behaved like his teacher, Rabbi Yochanan, would.” However, Rav Yosef replied, “You cannot deduce anything from this. For candelabra is different: if it is large and consists of part, one may come to assemble the parts, thus performing the forbidden labor of building, and other candelabras were prohibited on the account of this one.”
<br />
<br />
But Rabbi Shimon's opinion contradicts his other rulings. For while it is true that he permits to use the oil in the Shabbat lamp, after the light went out, he at the same time does not permit to slaughter a firstborn animal which developed a blemish on a holiday (Yom Tov), and says that the animal is muktzeh, not prepared for use on a Yom Tov! – Rabbi Shimon will answer that there is a big difference: a man sits and waits till his lamp goes out and he can use the oil; however, a blemish&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;in an animal is completely unforeseen, people do not sit and wait for it to develop, so the animal is indeed not prepared for slaughter on a Yom Tov.

Shabbat 47 – Ash

Rabbi Zeira said to him, “How could this be? Granted that one may move a basket with a stone inside, but that is only because this basket also has fruit in it; censer has only ashes, and they are not fit for use on Shabbat, and therefore muktzeh!”
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Assi was confounded for a moment, and then said, “Here too we are dealing with a censer that has granules of unburned incense! They are not muktzeh, and the censer can be carried because of them.” However, Abaye rejected this explanation:  “Granules are not considered as anything in the household of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. Rather, Rabbi Yehudah wanted the unpleasant censer moved away.” Rava, in turn, rejected this: “Censer is not repugnant, and besides, the ashes in a censer are covered. Rather, the ashes themselves were planned to be used on Shabbat, for covering dirt, and that is why they were not muktzeh, in fact, they were the important part, even if the rest was muktzeh.”
<br />
<br />
We thus see the rule: a muktzeh object may be moved together with another, permitted object, if they are together in one container, and if the permitted object is the more important one.
<br />
<br />
Going back to the Shabbat lamp, one may put a vessel under it, to catch the falling sparks, but not place water in that vessel. How is this different from a plate to collect dripping oil, which was forbidden? – Sparks are insignificant. Then why not put water? – Because that would be too close to actively extinguishing them.

Shabbat 48 – Wrap the food

That is allowed, as long as the material he uses does not add heat on its own. The reason is that if he were allowed to put his pot into heating substance, he might come to put it into hot ash mixed with live coals, and that in turn could lead him to rake the coals.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, one should not put the hot pot into olive pulp, manure, salt, lime, or sand, whether wet or dry, because all these add heat. He also may not use straw or grape skins if they are moist, but the dry ones are safe. He may use dry flocking (tufts of unprocessed cotton or soft wool).
<br />
<br />
Rav Adda bar Matnah asked, “Granted that one may insulate his food with flocking, but can he then move that flocking? Is it not set aside, and not fit for Shabbat use?” Abaye answered with a question, “Just because he does not have a box of straw and uses expensive material, does he renounce his use if it for later? – Of course not, he will do something with it later, and therefore he should not move it on Shabbat!” The Talmud answers, “It could be that this logic only applies if he did not use flocking for insulation, and he is not going to lie down on it, so indeed it has no use on Shabbat, but if he used it as insulation, that's exactly its use!” The question thus remains not completely resolved.

Shabbat 49 – Elisha with the dove's wings

<br />
<br />
Actually, any feathers can be used, but dove's feathers are mentioned because they were more common and because of a story that follows. What was Elisha's relationship with dove's wings? Once the Roman government passed an edict that anyone who dons tefillin will have his brain under tefillin taken out. Nevertheless, this person named Elisha was wearing them in the marketplace. A certain Roman quaestor saw him; Elisha fled from him, and the officer pursued. As the officer caught up, Elisha took the tefillin off and held them in his hand. “What is in your hand?” – asked the officer. Elisha answered, “Dove's wings”. He opened his hand, and indeed they were found to be dove's wings, and that is how Elisha got his nickname. 
<br />
<br />
Why did Elisha refer specifically to a dove? – Because of its connection to the Jewish people, who is protected with good deeds just as the dove is protected with wings. Why was Elisha not required to sacrifice his life, and on the other hand, how was he allowed to put his life in danger in the first place – these questions are also discussed.
<br />
<br />
One may insulate the food with hides, and even move them, because even unprocessed hives can be used for reclining. However, there is still a question about the hides of a craftstman, who plans to sell them – perhaps they are not designated for use on Shabbat and may not be handled, as muktzeh.

It happened once that Rav Chanina ben Akiva came to a certain place and found branches of date palms that were harvested for firewood. He told his students, “Go and mentally designate these branches for us, so that we may sit on them tomorrow (on Shabbat)." Zeiri, who was retelling this episode, added, “And I don’t know if it was for the house of feasting (wedding) or for the house of mourning.”<br />
<br />
From these words of Zeiri we see that only in such a place where people are preoccupied did Rav Chanina permit a mental designation, but in a normal situation he would require a physical action - tying the bundles - in order to sit on them on Shabbat. Otherwise they would be considered muktzeh, set aside from Shabbat use. However, although the Talmud goes into details elucidating it, the law does not follow this strict view.<br />
<br />
Ameimar, mar Zutra and Rav Ashi were sitting together one Shabbat, and they brought them “barda,” a mix of aloe, myrtle, and violets. Ameimar and Rav Ashi washed their faces and hands with it, but Mar Zutra did not. They asked him, “Are you afraid that you will accidentally remove some hair from your skin on Shabbat, through the use of aloe? – But the law is like Rabbi Shimon, that it is permitted, since the hair is removed only accidentally!” However, his reason was different – a man should not beautify himself as a woman does. Then what was their reason? – Just the opposite, one should clean and beautify himself, since this brings glory to God. In fact, one must say a blessing on a seeing handsome creature.<br />

Before it is night, one should not use materials that add heat, and on Shabbat itself – not even materials that don’t add heat.
<br />
<br />
However, that only applies if he did not wrap his pot while it was yet day. If he did, then even if the pot became uncovered, he can cover it again. Why? The whole reason for wrapping prohibition is so that he would not rake the coals and would not reheat the pot, if he finds that it has somewhat cooled off. If there is no such suspicion, accordingly, there is no prohibition.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, if he poured the food into another, different container, then he can wrap one. The logic here is that he already cooled the food off by pouring it into another container, so certainly he won’t reheat that new container.
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, one may wrap cold food so that they stay cold, and even to take the chill off – again, for the reason that there is no prohibition to stop him from doing.

If so, how can it graze, being that this is a prohibited labor of reaping? – The animal should be at ease, and restraining it would cause pain.&nbsp;Accordingly, the following rule tells us what constitutes not a burden, but normal animals’ wear and can therefore be worn by animals on Shabbat.<br />
<br />
A camel may wear a halter – a rope that is used to control it. All animals that normally wear a collar may go into a public area on Shabbat while wearing.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if one needs to sprinkle the animal with the ashes of a red heifer, to remove the impurity of the dead, one needs not take the collar off. So too, if he needs to immerse the animal, he may keep the collar on.<br />
<br />
However, we know that only humans can become ritually impure, and that the laws of ritual impurity do not apply to animals at all. – It is the collar that became impure and requires purification.  But even so, it is an animal’s collar, not a utensil used by people, and the Torah talked about impurity only for utensils in people’s use!? – This collar was initially made for humans, and then re-used for an animal.<br />

Donkeys are always cold, and that is why they need the saddle cloth, which goes underneath the saddle. However, the saddle cloth needs to have been tied before Shabbat, for then it is a proof that the donkey indeed needs it, and that is it not for the needs of the owner. The reason that it has to be tied at all is this: if the saddle cloth falls off the donkey, the owner may come to carry it at least four steps himself, and thus violate the prohibition of carrying on Shabbat.

Rams may go attached (in pairs) – the same term is used in the Song of Songs, “You attached (captivated) my heart, my sister, my bride.” Ulla gives a different explanation: attached means with leather attached close to their hearts, next to the underbelly. When a wolf attacks, the ram gets up on its hind legs to fight the wolf, and the wolf then bites the underbelly. Do wolves then attack only male sheep, and not females? Females also need protection! – Rather, the males are attacked because they are fat. Are females then never fat? And furthermore, do wolves know the difference? – Rather, the male sheep are attacked because they hold their noses high and look from side to side when walking, so the wolves think that they are being attacked.

Shabbat 54 – What animal may not wear

What are the examples of such items? A camel may not go with a saddle cloth, since if it falls, the owner of the camel might carry it further. Nor may it go out bound (with its legs chained together) or hobbled (with its one lower foreleg bent upward toward the upper foreleg and tied). These cause pain to the animal, and are hence not welcomed by it and are a burden. In fact, this applies to any animal.
<br />
<br />
One may not tie camels to each other and pull one of them so that the others follow – because then he looks as if taking them to a marketplace for sale. However, he may gather their ropes into his hand and pull each one by his own rope – provided that he does not wind the ropes around his hand.
<br />
<br />
What is the reason for the last rule? This is talking about a special case when the rope is made of wool and linen – and one is forbidden to derive benefit, such as to warm his hand, from this combination. Wool reminds of Abel, who was a shepherd, and linen reminds of Cain, who worked the land, and the combination reminds of Cain killing Abel, so by refraining from this we correct his action in some measure.

Shabbat 55 – The cow of Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah

A cow may not go with a hedgehog skin around its udder (made as protection against rodents), nor can it have a strap between its horns. The cow of Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah used to go out with a strap between her horns, and it was against the will of the Sages.
<br />
<br />
Now, this last fact is strange: Rabbi Elazar ben Arayah's tithe alone constituted twelve thousand calves yearly, so he indeed had more than one cow! – In truth, it was a cow of his female neighbor, and because he did not stop her, the ruling ascribes the transgression to him.
<br />
<br />
In general, one must improve not only himself but other people as well. If one can improve the people of his family but does not, he is held accountable for them. The same is true for his town and even the whole world. However, if one knows that he won't be listened to, he must be silent, for otherwise, they may do the opposite on purpose.
<br />
<br />
Before the destruction of Jerusalem, God told angel Gabriel to put a letter "tav" in black on the foreheads of the righteous (for "tihye" - he will live), and the letter "tav" in red n the foreheads of the bad ones (for "tamut" - he will die). However, the attribute of Strict Justice asked, "How are two different?" God replied, "Clearly, these are righteous, and they have fulfilled all the laws of the Torah, from the letter aleph to the letter tav, but the others are not!" The Strict Justice, however, said, "The righteous should have stopped the bad!" God said, "They would not listen, I know." The Attribute of Justice then said, "You know, but how do they know?" and the decree was reversed, and the righteous were killed first.

Rather, he defended his own mother, by moving Jacob's bed out of Bilhah's tent to that of his mother.” What is the proof? – In the next Torah phrase, “And the sons of Jacob were twelve” – all equal in statue. However, there is also an opinion that he was greatly tempted but stopped himself, and even another opinion, that he did cohabit with her.
<br />
<br />
He also stated, “Whoever says that the <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et08a02.htm">sons of Eli, the High Priest, sinned with women who brought their sacrifices</a>, is simply mistaken. Rather, they delayed these sacrifices and thus prevented the women from returning to their husbands.” The proof? – Since they are listed in the honorable line of the priests, they were also righteous; however, their actions were as bad as if they had lain with the women.
<br />
<br />
He also stated, “Whoever says that the sons of Shmuel (who '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et08a08.htm">went after monetary gain</a>') sinned, is simply mistaken. They only 'did not go in the ways of their father,' who visited all places in Israel to resolve disputes. Instead, they lived in their place, attended their own affairs, and thus increased the wages of their scribes.” However, there is an opinion of Rabbi Yehudah that they gave goods to merchants to sell and were then partial to these merchants, which is equivalent to taking bribes.
<br />
<br />
He also stated, “Whoever says that David sinned with Batsheva, is simply mistaken. He only wanted to do so, but did not.” The proof? – “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et08a18.htm">David was successful in his ways, and God was always with him</a>.” In fact, the soldiers in David's army all gave conditional divorces to their wives, so that in the case of their death without witnesses she would have a permission to remarry. Thus after Uriah's death his divorce took place retroactively.&nbsp;This practice David had&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et08a17.htm">learned from his family</a>.&nbsp;David only wanted to cohabit with her before she got the document. &nbsp;All the phrases in the story then take on a different meaning.<br />

Shabbat 57 – What a woman may not wear outside

Wearing clothes is perfectly permitted on Shabbat. However, jewelry and ornaments could present a problem: a woman might take them off, to show off to a friend, and then forget to put them back on and carry in a public area, thus violating Shabbat. The Sages composed a list of items that may not be warn on Shabbat, to prevent this possibility.
<br />
<br />
A woman may not go outside on Shabbat wearing either woolen strands or linen strands, or straps on her head, and she may not immerse herself in  a mikveh while wearing them, until she loosens them.
<br />
<br />
What does mikveh have to do with it? – It actually gives another reason: if a chance to perform a mikveh immersion (such as needed for eating tithe) will present itself, she may take them off, immerse herself, and then forget &nbsp;to tie them back and come to carry in a public area.<br />
<br />
Neither may she go out with a “totefet” - an ornamental band going to from one ear to the other, made either of colored strands or of gold or silver. It is called a “totefet” because it is warn in the place of tefillin. 
<br />
<br />
Some say that the prohibition is not only against wearing these items in a public area, but even in one's own courtyard, for she may then forget and step outside. Regardless of the rules above, it was a custom of Jewish women to wear jewelry and ornaments on Shabbat as far back as the tenth century. The reason for it is a subject of much discussion.

Shabbat 58 – Servant's emblem

However, these two contradictory rulings apply to different situations: in one case the the emblem was made for the servant by the master, and in another case he fashioned it by himself.
<br />
<br />
If it was made by his master, then the master obviously insists on the servant's wearing it, and there is thus no danger that he will remove it and carry it in his hands or pocket. However, if he made it by himself, he may indeed remove it, to hide the indication that he is someone's servant, and continue carrying it, and that is why the Sages prohibited him wearing it on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
Then why is it prohibited to wear an emblem sown into clothing? According to our explanation, it should be allowed, at least when it is made by the master? For that we have another reason: commonly these emblems were made of clay, and they could break and fall of the garment. Should that happen, the servant might be afraid lest his master see it and be angry; so the servant would take the cloak off and fold it, hiding the place of the emblem. Then he would be liable for carrying his cloak. Therefore, the Sages prohibited him from wearing such cloak on Shabbat in a public area.

Incidentally, this bell is susceptible to ritual impurity. But in another place we learned that is not susceptible!? – Not a problem: the first case is when it has a clapper, and the second one is when it does not. But why should this be the case? It is either a utensil or it is not, with the clapper or without!? – That is exactly the point, without a clapper it is not fit for its original purpose.
<br />
<br />
To illustrate, consider a metal shoe of an animal. For impurity, what use can it be fit for if not worn by an animal? Rav says, to drink from it in battle; Rav Chanina says, to anoint oil with it for the battle; Rabbi Yochanan says, to use it to flee from battle, stepping over thorns. Their disagreement is about how close to the original use does the new use have to be. The differences between them emerge when it is dirty (you won't drink from it) or when it is heavy (you won't run in it).
<br />
<br />
“Jerusalem of gold” was a golden ornament with the likeness of Jerusalem, like the one Rabbi Akiva fashioned for his wife. Can a woman wear it on Shabbat? Some say that it is burden and she would violate the Torah; some that it is an ornament, but it is prohibited, since she can show it off to her friend, and then carry; and some – that it is completely allowed, since a prominent women wearing it won't take it off to show.

If he does so unwittingly, then, once he realizes his mistake, he has to bring a sacrifice. If he does it consciously and there are witnesses who tell him not to do it, he is liable to stoning, and if there are no witnesses, he may be cut off from his spiritual source. What is considered private domain for this purpose? One's house qualifies, but even any area bigger than four by four hand-breadths and surrounded by walls, or partitions, is also considered private. What is considered a public area? Any highway, a large public plaza, a street that is not delimited by doors from both sides, and any place where multitudes walk.  
<br />
<br />
There are also areas that are not completely private – because they are not surrounded by walls – nor are they public, since multitudes don't usually go there. Such areas includes a sea and an area in front of  a store where merchants show their wares. Since such an area has the traits of both private and public domains, the Sages prohibited carrying in them, just like in public domain, and transfering from them to both a private and a public domain.
<br />
<br />
Finally, there are areas that are so small and insignificant that were called “exempt,” such as a threshold of a house. Because they are so small, one may transfer to them and from them, so long as he does not use it to remove the  prohibition altogether, by passing the object first to the threshold and then into the house.

This is prohibited because of the following incident.
<br />
<br />
Once, in the times of Roman persecution, people were hiding on Shabbat in a cave. They made a rule: anybody can come in, but nobody can leave. One person came in a sandal that became reversed (this sandal could be worn from both ends), and people mistakenly thought that someone has gone to denounce them. In the ensuing panic people pushed and kicked, and they killed more of each other than did the enemy. To prevent people from remembering this sad incident, the Sage forbade wearing such shoes on Shabbat. – But if so, let these shoes be forbidden altogether!? – The prohibition was only in circumstances similar to the incident.
<br />
<br />
Some relate a story where the people hiding in a case heard a noise, some say that they were hiding in a synagogue, and some say that all three incidents actually happened. However, multiple variants of hobnailed shoes are allowed: those that are made for ornamental purposes (as evidenced by fewer of the nails being used), and those whose hobnails have worn out and are now level with the sole.

If people start mocking him, he may be tempted to take if off and carry, which is forbidden. However, if he has a wound, then it is allowed, because he won't take the shoe off. Which foot has to be wounded, the one with the shoe or the one without it? Those who hold that the shoes are mainly for protection say that the shoe is on the foot with the wound, but those who hold that the shoes are mainly for comfort will say that the shoe is on the healthy foot.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan said that there is a connection between shoes and tefillin: just as arm tefillin is work on the left arm, which shows its importance, so too one should put on the left shoe first. However, there is a contradictory general rule that the right should always take precedence. Therefore, one should try to behave himself according to both views. How can this be accomplished? He puts on the right shoe first, but when he ties them, he ties the left shoe first. 
<br />
<br />
Health amulets were popular, and they either had the names of God in various combinations or contained special herbs. One may not go out on Shabbat with such an amulet, but if it is from a proven amulet-writer and has already cured at least three people, then this is part of his attire, and it is allowed.

Shabbat 62 – Balsam oil

On Shabbat, a woman may not go out with a needle that has an eye and is used for sowing. Carrying such a needle is prohibited by the Torah, and one needs to bring a sacrifice if she did so inadvertently. This is true even if the needle is pinned to her clothing. Usually, only the normal way of doing an act is prohibited by the Torah. However, since it is quote normal to carry a needle this way, it too is prohibited. Certainly it is prohibited to simply carry it in one's hand.<br />
<br />
Nor may she wear a signet ring, although she can wear a regular ring. Ulla noticed: “With men, it is the reverse.” Is this logic then always true? On the contrary, since some people (shepherds) wear sackcloth, it becomes permitted for all people? – That is because Ulla considers women as a separate nation: just because a woman wears something, it does not become permitted to men.
<br />
<br />
A woman may not wear a spice bundle or a flask of balsam oil, and if she does, she is liable to bring a sacrifice – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. However, the Sages hold that these items are ornaments, and in fact Rabbi Eliezer completely allows this, since a woman wearing such perfumes will not take them off.
<br />
<br />
Balsam played a role in the Temple's destruction, and Rabbi Yehudah wanted to forbid its use, but the Sages did not agree. Jewish women used to flaunt their beauty and to seduce young men by spraying balsam perfume over them. However, the decree of destruction was sealed because of the attitude of men, who used flowery language to describe their deeds. They would ask each other, “On what did you dine today, on bread that was well kneaded or on bread that was not well kneaded? On white wine or dark wine? On a wide couch or on a narrow couch?” All these were hints to illicit relations.
<br />
<br />
The logs of Jerusalem were of the cinnamon tree, and when they burned, their fragrance would waft through all of the Land of Israel. After destruction they were hidden, except a piece the size of a barley grain found in the storehouses of Queen Tzimtzemai.

Rabbi Eliezer says, “These are his ornaments,” since they enhance his appearance. However, the Sages, who forbid it, say that it is nothing but a disgrace, following the Isaiah that “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1002.htm">They will beat their swords into plowshares</a>.”<br />
<br />
If so, what is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? He quotes the psalms, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2645.htm">Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, for it is your glory and your splendor</a>.” However, Rav Kahana said in explaining this verse, “This is talking about the words of Torah. Just as a sword is always ready, so should be your learning, and this ability to recall it at will is your glory and splendor.” Then Mar, the son of Rav Huna, told him, “You may be right, and learning is the main import of this phrase, but what about the rule that a literal meaning of any verse is never completely discarded!?”
<br />
<br />
To this Rav Kahana replied, “When I was eighteen, I already learned the entire Talmud, but I never knew this rule!”  Why did he have to tell us this? – To teach that one may learn even without understanding, just accumulating knowledge, and afterwards reason about it. So too Rav Kahana did not completely understand the reason of Rabbi Eliezer, yet he persevered in his studies.<br />

Shabbat 64 – Ornaments of a woman on Shabbat

All parts of this ruling are necessary. Otherwise we might have thought that her own hair is acceptable because she is used to it, but not that of her companion. Or we might think that human hair would blend into hers, whereas the animal's would not, and she might then take it off and carry – so the ruling tells us that there is no such concern.
<br />
<br />
However, a elderly woman should not go out with strands of a young woman's hair, nor the young woman with the old one's hair. Here we understand the first part: they might mock an elderly woman for her attempts, and she might then carry the strands, but why would a young woman wear the old one's hair strands? – In truth, she would not, but the ruling just mentions this possibility for symmetry.
<br />
<br />
A frontlet or head bangles can be worn when sewn into a woman's hat – because she would not take the hat off in the street and uncover her hair. A woman may go out with a wad in her sandal, for comfort, or with a peppercorn in her mouth, for pleasant breath – provided that she puts these in before Shabbat, for otherwise the onlookers may think that it is just a design to carry in a public area.

Rabbi Yehudah the Prince allows it, but the Sages forbid it. What are their reasons?
<br />
<br />
The Sages say that a woman may show her tooth to her companions, then forget and carry it. Rabbi Yehudah says that this is not such an outstanding show-and-tell item. Alternatively, the Sages' concern is that people will ridicule her, and she will take it out, and then carry. Again, Rabbi Yehudah, in this explanation, does not consider a golden tooth to be an object of ridicule. None of these reasons apply to a silver tooth, and certainly to a naturally-looking tooth.
<br />
<br />
Women residing in Arabia often wore headcloths that would wrap their head; though unusual, it is a garment, and therefore may be worn on Shabbat. Similarly, Median women used to fasten their cloaks with stones; normally considered “muktzeh”, set aside from use on Shabbat, a stone is allowed as part of clothing. In fact, this all is allowed for any person, but the rulings are given in terms of prevalent custom.

His weight is then supported by a crutch or a wooden stump. Nevertheless, Rabbi Meir considers this a shoe and permits wearing it on Shabbat. However, Rabbi Yose disagrees: according to him, it is not a shoe unless it is made out of leather, nor is it an ornament, since most people would not use it, and therefore our amputee cannot go out in such shoe on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
One who has both feet severed cannot walk without crutches. He will often fashion leather pads for his shins and knees. These are made to support his weight, so he may wear then on Shabbat; however, since they are not worn on his feet, but on his legs, they do not have the legal status of shoes, and one can enter the Temple in them (where the shoes are normally prohibited).
<br />
<br />
One whose lower legs have atrophied uses a chair, leg supports, and crutches. The chair and crutches are  essential for his moving about, but the leg supports are not, and he should not go out with them on Shabbat. And, since they are worn on his feet, he may not enter them Temple in them.
<br />
<br />
Masks used to playfully frighten small children are neither ornaments nor garments, and consequently one may not wear them on Shabbat outside.

She taught him very many things quoted in the Talmud, and here is one.
<br />
<br />
Abaye said, “My mother told me that one afflicted with daily fever should take a white, newly-minted zuz coin, measure its weight in salt, then tie the salt by the neck opening of his shirt with a strand of hair.”
<br />
<br />
“If this remedy is not available, he must sit at the crossroads and when he sees a large ant carrying something, he must take the ant and place it into a copper tube, close the tube with lead, and seal it with sixty different type of seal. Then he must shake the tube, carry it, and say to the ant, 'Your burden is upon me, and my burden is upon you.'”
<br />
<br />
But, says the Talmud, what if another person already placed his burden on this ant? Rather, he should say, “My burden is upon you, and your burden is upon you.”
<br />
<br />
One may go out on Shabbat with a locust's egg, with a fox's tooth, or with a nail from the gallows of one that was hanged. All these items have therapeutically value, and are thus ornaments, not a forbidden burden – these are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, the Sages prohibit these practices even on weekdays, since they involve magic and were used by other nations.

Shabbat 68 – A “major” rule about Shabbat

Why is this so? Since some phrases of the Torah refer to single sacrifice, and some – to multiple ones, it is entirely logical to say that when there exists one root cause for all his violations – forgetting that there is a prohibition to do work on Shabbat in the Torah – that is the case where one sacrifice is brought.<br />
<br />
What about someone who never even knew about Shabbat, like a child who was taken away in captivity when he was very young, or one who converts to Judaism on his own accord, without any Jews around to tell him about Shabbat? He did not forget, rather, he never knew! Still, Rav and Shmuel both say that he is responsible for one sacrifice for all his actions.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish both say that the rule of one sacrifice refers only to one who knew about Shabbat and then forgot. One who never knew about it cannot be blamed for violations, and is thus free from any obligation to bring a sacrifice when he understands Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
Why is this rule called “major?” – Because there are more ways to violate Shabbat than, for example the sevenths year, or Sheviit – since its prohibitions refer only to plants still in the ground, whereas Shabbat laws refers also to things disconnected from the ground.

<br />
<br />
Since there are thirty-nine types of work prohibited types of work, he can potentially be liable to thirty-nine sacrifices. However, how is this extreme case possible? If he knows that it is Shabbat, but forgets about each specific prohibited work, then what exactly does he know? He may know that the name of the day is Saturday, but since to him it is no different from any other day, he in fact does not know that it is Shabbat! If so, we are back to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/12/shabbat-68-major-rule-about-shabbat.html">the rule</a> where he does not know about Shabbat altogether, and has to bring only one sacrifice!?
<br />
<br />
Answers Rabbi Yochanan: “He knew that each labor was prohibited, but he forgot that for performing them he becomes liable to be cut off from the spiritual source.” That too is considered “forgetting the prohibition” in some sense, and thus become obligated to bring all thirty-nine sacrifices.

Earlier we learned that there special areas on Shabbat which are neither public nor private, such as the sea. It is not private, because it is not surrounded by walls. Neither it is public, because public does not walk there. The Sages prohibited carrying objects on Shabbat in such areas, but since it is not a Torah prohibition, one is not liable for a sacrifice or a punishment if he carries there. Such areas are called “karmelit.” What is the etymology of this word? Some say that it means “great forest.” Others say that it means “ripe grain,” which is in the intermediate state of being neither too moist nor too dry.
<br />
<br />
If there is a brick in the street, and one threw a sticky object on it, and it landed on the side of the brick, one has violated Shabbat – because this object as hanging in the air so close to the ground that it is considered to be on the ground. However, if the object landed on top of the brick, he is not liable, because it is a separate area, not part of the street, and people don't walk there – provided that is is taller than three hand-breadths. Rava said that even if the object landed on thorns and they are lower than three hand-breadths – he is not liable, since people don't walk on thorn-bushes. Rabbi Chiyya makes him liable even in the case of thorn-bushes, but not excrement. Finally, Rav Ashi makes him liable even when he threw an object on the excrement – because he says that anything that is lower than three hand-breadths is automatically part of the public area.

<br />
<br />
Rava added that on every day he can only do as much labor as is needed to stay alive, because this might actually be Shabbat, and he can't desecreate it, even out of doubt. On the seventh day he does no labor. The Talmud asks, and on the seventh day he should die? – He should work twice as much on the day before! – But maybe the day before is Shabbat? Rather, he should work the same amount on every day. But then, how is Shabbat different? – Because he says the kiddush – prayer welcoming Shabbat – at the beginning of it, and the Havdallah – prayer welcoming weekdays – at the end.

Earlier we learned that if one knows that it is Shabbat and does multiple acts of prohibited work by mistake, he is liable for a sacrifice for each violation. Why should this be the case? – Because he brings a sacrifice for each mistake. – Still, why not say that this is all one mistake? – Because the Torah  said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=31#P2432">One who violates Shabbat will die, he will die</a>” - we see multiple punishments for multiple mistakes. But that is talking about one who violates Shabbat knowingly!? – That we already know from <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=35#P2531">another verse</a>, and therefore, since the new law is not needed for its own sake, let's apply it to another context, where he violates Shabbat by mistake. This proves it.

Shabbat 71 – Drag-along atonement

If one forgot that it was Shabbat, and reaped in the amount of a dried fig (sufficient for Shabbat violation) and then ground it, then, as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/12/shabbat-68-major-rule-about-shabbat.html">we learned earlier</a>, he brings one sacrifice for both, since the root cause was his one error regarding Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
However, if he then remembered that it was Shabbat, but this time forgot that reaping and grinding were prohibited, he would be liable to two sacrifices, one for each error. Finally, if he becomes aware of his first mistake, then his initial reaping connects to the second one, his initial grinding connects to the second one, and the end result is that he brings only one sacrifice for all, and it drags along the atonement for his other acts. The other way around is not completely true: if he finds out about his later reaping, it connects to the previous one, but his later grinding does not connect to the first one, and he needs a separate sacrifice for that. We don't use the principle of drag-along twice – this is the opinion of Rava.
<br />
<br />
However, Abaye says that we do use the drag-along twice, and only one sacrifice is brought in either case.
<br />
<br />
In another place, we find that Rava does not subscribe to drag-along!? – After he heard the idea from Abaye, he started using it. But then let him agree to Abaye completely! – No, he applied only a part of Abaye's principle, but not all of it.

Shabbat 72 – Guilt

However, the punishments for cohabiting with her is different from the standard one of a regular married woman, and consists of bringing a guilt offering. Moreover, for multiple acts of cohabitation he is still liable for only one offering. This stands in contrast to Shabbat violation, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/12/shabbat-68-major-rule-about-shabbat.html">where one brings an offering for each violation</a>.
<br />
<br />
Yet another leniency is that one brings the same offering whether one cohabits with a woman slave by mistake or intentionally. And, as Ulla stated, even if one brings a guilt offering without being aware that he brings it for his cohabitation with a woman slave, it is still effective. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Hamnuna challenged Ulla: “Imagine that one cohabited with a woman slave, then cohabited again, then designated and brought a sacrifice to the Temple, and now he tells the Kohen to wait a little longer till he cohabits again and comes back, so that his sacrifice will atone for the newest act also, will it work? Do you mean to go that far?” To this Ulla replied, “You are talking about an act after the designations of the sacrifice? That I never have meant; after designation he will need another offering.”

This is derived from the phrase of “Build My Temple, but stop the work and observe Shabbat.” It also includes preparatory activities.
<br />
<br />
Outside the Temple, the list includes other activities similar to the main ones. For this reason, the primary thirty-nine designate groups rather than specific types of work. The list begins with eleven labors necessary for baking bread: sowing, plowing, reaping, gathering (sheaves) together, threshing, winnowing, selecting (rock out of grain), grinding, sifting, kneading, and baking.
<br />
<br />
Then come the thirteen labors involved in the preparation of clothing: shearing wool, whitening it, disentangling it, dyeing, spinning, mounting the warp, setting two neddles on the loom, weaving at least two threads, removing threads in order to re-weave, tying a knot and untying a knot, sewing two stitches and tearing in order to sew another two stitches.
<br />
<br />
Hides and writing: trapping a deer, slaughtering it, skinning it, salting it, tanning its hide, smoothing, cutting it, writing at least two letters and erasing in order to write another two letters.
<br />
<br />
Finally, six more labors: building and demolishing, extinguishing and kindling, adding a finishing touch to his work (such as striking the final blow with the hammer), and carrying within the public domain or from a domain to another domain.

Shabbat 74 – What is selection?

Regarding it, we learned a cryptic rule: "If one had different foods in front of him, he may select and eat, and he may select and leave for others to eat, and he may not select, and if he did select, he needs to bring a sacrifice."<br />
<br />
Obviously, the four parts of the rule must all be talking about different situations to which each of it applies. Ulla explained, "He may select for this day and eat, but he may not select for the needs of the next day, because real selection is usually done for storage." Rav Chisda objected, "If one then allowed to bake for today?" Meaning, if it is a labor forbidden when done for tomorrow, how can it be permitted for today's needs? Rather, he can select less than the minimal amount of food, that is, a dried fig, but he may not do so for more than that.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef took issue with that, "How can it be allowed to performed forbidden labor in small amounts?" Rather, he is allowed to select with the hand, but not with an implement, such as a funnel. Rav Hamnuna challenged this also: "Does the rule mention anything about a funnel?" Rather, one can select good food and eat, but not bad food and leave it, similar to pebbles and grain! Abaye argued in turn, "Does the rule mention anything about good food and bad food?" Rather, he may select and eat immediately, or give to others to eat now; however, he may not select and leave for later, and if he did, it is as if he selected for storage, and that is prohibited.
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the selection that is allowed follows all of the criteria: it should be for immediate consumption, selecting good for from the bad, and done with the hand. That, too, is subject to interpretation based on the order of how the opinions listed above combine.<br />

<br />
<br />
Another source and reason for this view is “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5008">You shall safeguard and perform those laws, since it is your  wisdom and discernment in the eyes of the nations</a>.” What is this wisdom?

<br />
<br />
Another one of the prohibited Shabbat labors is slaughtering an animal. What exact prohibited action is he performing? Rav said, “He is dyeing. When he makes the cut in the animal's throat, required for proper slaughter, the blood spurts out and colors the animal's neck. ” Shmuel said, “He is taking a life.” But according to Rav, isn't he also liable for taking a life? – Indeed, he is, and Rav meant, “Also for dyeing.” Rav also said, “If I don't explain my view, the future generations will come to ridicule me. Why is the slaughterer interested in dyeing the throat of the animal with blood? – Because then the meat commands a higher price in the market.”

What is considered a significant amount for which one would have to bring a sacrifice if he carries it by mistake? Here is a general rule: if it is something that people normally store, and its quantity is significant enough for people to care about it and store it, carrying this amount is considered a bona fide violation of Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
It also depends on the intended use. For example, if one carries processed straw, then the significant amount is a cow's mouthful. If it is stalks of straw, it should measure lamb's mouthful, and if it is grass, fit for young goats or sheep, the amount is their mouthful.
<br />
<br />
Leaves of garlic and of onion are fit for human consumption, so the amount for which one is liable on Shabbat becomes a standard measure of minimal amount of food, that is, a dried fig. If these leaves dry out, then again they are not fit for humans and revert to animal food, so the significant amount is the mouthful of a young sheep or goat.

Since we are talking here about pure wine, which in the times of this ruling was first diluted, we arrive at a measure called “reviit,” or about 75 grams. Honey is considered significant if there is enough of it to be put on a sore. Rav Ashi asked, “At the top of the sore, or from the top down?” – No answer was found.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yehudah said, “Of all things that God created in His world, He did not create anything needlessly. For example, a slug can be used as a remedy for a sore; a fly as a cure for the sting of a hornet; snake provides cure for skin conditions.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Zeira once found Rav Yehudah (a usually austere Sage) at the door of his father-in-law in such a lighthearted mood that if Rav Zeira were to ask him any question in the world, Rav Yehudah would tell him. Rav Zeira asked multiple questions, such as “Why goats always walk in front of the flock?” – Because darkness always precedes light, just as in the creation of the world. “Why are sheep's hindquarters covered with a tail, but goat's aren't” – Because people cover themselves with shearing of the sheep, but not of goats”.
<br />
<br />
He also asked questions about word construction, such as “Why outer cloak called 'levushah'?” – Because it is a contraction of “No shame – 'lo bushah.'”
<br />
<br />
The Talmud adds one more statement on natural phenomena, that three creatures grow stronger as they grow older: the fish, the snake and the pig. All of these statements have a spiritual meaning behind them.

Hide – enough to make an amulet; parchment (thinner, processed hide) – enough to write the smallest paragraph of the four paragraphs that are written inside a tefillin; ink – enough to write two letters.

<br />
<br />
If one carries the actual receipt, the situation is different. Here he is liable only until he has shown the receipt to the tax collector, but after that he does not need it as the receipt; the paper itself at this time could not be re-used by erasure, and thus he is not liable. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that he is always in need of the tax receipt and is always liable for carrying it. What can he do with it? He will show it to another tax collector and say, “Look, I am a trustworthy person who always pays his taxes.”
<br />
<br />
A similar discussion concerns a loan document. If one carries it in a public area on Shabbat, he transgressed Shabbat if the loan has not been paid, but he is not liable afterwards. Again, Rabbi Yehudah says that he is always in need of this document. What is the reasoning here? The first teacher is of the opinion that it is forbidden to keep the loan document after the loan has been paid. Rather, it should be torn up or returned to the borrower, to avoid a double payment. Therefore the document is not useful, and for carrying something that is not useful one does not need to bring a sacrifice. Rabbi Yehudah, however, says that it is not forbidden to keep a paid-up loan document, rather, it can be used as a bottle-stopper. The Talmud gives three more possible explanations.

Shabbat 8 – Throwing a basket

That is because a basket which is that big qualifies as a private domain itself, and one is only liable for throwing objects, not domains. However, if it was smaller than six hand-breadths in diameter, then it is not a domain but an object, and for that he is liable. 
<br />
<br />
That was the statement of Abaye. Rava added that if it was exactly ten hand-breadths high, then he is not liable either: some leaves are bound to protrude beyond the ten hand-breadths, and this is how high the public domain extends, so the object was never fully in the public domain, and for such partial transfers one is again not liable. And Abaye, what does he answer? He agrees in principle, but considers leaves insignificant. 
<br />
<br />
If the basket overturned in the air and landed on its rim, then even if it was seven hand-breadths, one is not liable: while in the air, being three hand-breadths above the ground, it had its walls downwards, and using the principle that “one may extend the walls” we say that it already touched the ground while it was in the air above ten hand-breadths, and as we just saw, one is not liable for partial transfers.

Rav Ashi disagrees and makes him liable. He says that we can use the principle of “extend the walls” only when the extended walls make something fit for use, and in our case the walls of the basket extending downward do not help anybody.

Shabbat 80 – Ink and oil

Whether this ink is an an inkwell (with more ink on the walls) or in a quill, the amount liquid ink must be sufficient for writing the letters. Rava asked, “If he took ink for one letter in a ink-well, and for another letter in a quill, do they combine?” – No one found an answer.
<br />
<br />
The minimal amount of lime is defined as “enough to smear on a little girl.” What does this mean? Rav Yehudah explained, “Jewish daughters who matured but were still young in years and desired to remove unwanted hair: the daughters of the poor would smear themselves with lime; the daughters of the rich would use flour; and the daughters of the kings – would smear themselves with virgin olive oil.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Nechemyah gives a larger limit on lime: enough to smear on the “andipi.” What is “andipi?” We learn this from the following story. A person from Galilee came to Babylon. They asked him to expound on the deep secrets of “The working of the chariot,” and he unhesitatingly agreed. Before he started, however, a hornet emerged from a nearby wall and stung him on the forehead (“andipi”), so that he died. We learn from here that “andipi” is the forehead.

Shabbat 81 – Using a bathroom

Clay – enough for sealing cargo sacks – says Rabbi Akiva, but the Sages say – enough to seal a letter. Fertilizer – enough for a cabbage – that is Rabbi Akiva, and the Sages say – enough for a leek. A reed – enough for a small pen, and if unusable for a pen – enough to cook an egg on a skillet; and which egg cooks the fastest? – that of a chicken.
<br />
<br />
At that time, they used stones to wipe after relieving themselves. Zonin came to the study hall and asked, “My teachers! How many stones can one take to the bathroom?” Normally, stones are not prepared for Shabbat use and are therefore muktzeh, not to be handled. Additionally, one should not carry them – unless he goes less than four steps at a time and then stops, thus staying below the prohibited distance.
<br />
<br />
The Sages told him, “He can use the same sizes that he uses on weekdays: the first the size of an olive, the second the size of the nut, and the third the size of an egg.” They thus told him that the Shabbat prohibitions are relaxed to accommodate the unavoidable needs of people. Still, Zonin insisted, “Shall he bring a balance scale with him, to ascertain the weight?” After discussion, they voted to allow a handful of stones.

Shabbat 82 – Hints

The result is that we can reason about their laws using the same deductions as in the Torah.
<br />
<br />
For example, there are a few cases in the Torah where one who carries an item indirectly, without touching it, nevertheless becomes ritually impure, such as meat of a non-kosher animal or a kosher one that was killed but not by slaughter. How do we know that the Sages applied the same law to one who carries an idol? – Explains Rabbi Akiva, since Isaiah says that in the future the Jews will “Cast the idols away as other objects that engender impurity, and you will say to them – Go!” – therefore we know that the Sages established ritual impurity for one who carries an idol. 
<br />
<br />
What else can we learn from the comparison of an idol to, for example, a “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a>” – man who had a special type of emission? – That just as his impurity does not apply to separate members of his body, so too it does not apply to pieces of an idol.

However, this is talking about pieces, about which the idolater reasons, “The idol could not protect itself, surely it is not going to protect me.”
<br />
<br />
Rav Chama asked a related question, “If one uses an idol that is assembled from parts, does it still convey impurity when disassembled? When a layman can reassemble the idol,” - he added - “I don't even need to ask, since this is considered as if it was intact. My only question is when only an expert can reassemble it. Do we say that this is better than a broken one, and the impurity is back, or do we say that right now the idol is unusable, and it conveys no impurity?”
<br />
<br />
Others presented his question in a different way: where a layman cannot assemble it, there is no need to ask, since it is as good as broken. The only question is when a layman can in fact assemble it back. Do we say that it is considered as whole, or do way say that on the contrary, right now it is pulled apart and dismantled, and is therefore unusable, and carries no impurity? – Which? This question remained unresolved.

A ship is unique in this respect. Other objects, for example, boxes small enough to be carried, do accept spiritual impurity. The law itself was known to Solomon, but he could not understand its reason.<br />
<br />
Another allusion: the Torah writes, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=19#P4301">When a man dies in a tent... all utensils under the tent will be impure</a>.” Rabbi Yochanan explained, this teaches that a man should never leave the tent of study, &nbsp;until the day of his death. Resh Lakish said, “Moreover, he will remember his learning only if he literally kills himself for its sake” – just as the Torah said, “When a man dies in a tent”.

In general, it is forbidden to plant different species together, and here we can derive that on a garden patch of six by six hand-breadths one can plant five types of seeds but no more. How do we know that?
<br />
<br />
“Gives forth” denotes one species, “its plant” is another, “its seeds” implies two, for the total of four, and “to sprout” is the fifth. The Talmud gives multiple possible layouts for seed planting, as well as derives that the size of the patch is indeed six by six hand-breadths, and that it is situated in a barren area, for otherwise other seeds would impede the planting of the five species inside.

Shabbat 86 – Three days before the giving of the Torah

Do not come near a woman.'”
<br />
<br />
The Torah had to be given to people who are ritually pure. All other sources of impurity can be eliminated by going to a mikveh, after which the person becomes ritually pure. Therefore, the only reason for the three-day waiting period was the potential for semen – if it is viable – to be expelled later, and the semen is considered viable for three days. The Talmud also discusses other opinions on how long this period can be.
<br />
<br />
Actually, a person right out of the mikveh is considered pure, with a tinge of impurity until sunset. Still, it could have been enough for giving the Torah. Why, for example, was the Torah not given on Friday, right after everyone went to a mikveh? – Because God did not want to do it in secret at night. Then why was the mikveh time not set for Saturday morning, with the Torah given right after that? – Because then some would be returning from the mikveh, with others just going  there, and the Jewish people needed a complete unity.

Shabbat 87 – When was the Torah given?

However, Rabbi Yose says that this happened on the seventh of Sivan.
<br />
<br />
Rava put their disagreement in perspective: all agree that the Jews arrived to Sinai on the first of the month. How do we know? Because in Egypt God said, “This month (Nissan) will be for you the first of the months,” on at Sinai it says “On this day they arrived.” The word “this” connects the two and teaches us that both were the first of the month.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, all agree that the Torah was given on Shabbat. And why is that? – Because part of the giving of the Torah was “Remember Shabbat,” so this must have happened on Shabbat itself, just as in Egypt, where it says “Remember this day,” and it was said on this very day.
<br />
<br />
If so, where do they disagree? – They disagree about on what day was the first of the month. Then what does Rabbi Yose do with the extra day in his count? – He says that Moses added an extra day of preparation, but God later agreed with him. Actually, Moses did three things on his own, to all of which God later agreed. The first is the one we just mentioned, the second is when he separated from his wife, so that he could be ready to experience Divine presence at any time, and third is when he broke the tablets. How do we know that God agreed? – From the last words of the Torah, “Which Moses broke in front of everyone.” God said, “Well done!” with no trace of displeasure.

<br />
<br />
When the Jews promised first to “do” and after to “hear what to do,” God asked, “Who revealed to them the secret of the angels, who also <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a3.htm">fulfill My word, and then listen to My voice</a>?” To illustrate, Rava was once studying the Talmud without noticing that his foot was stomping on his fingers so that they were bleeding. A certain Sadducee told him, “You were impulsive you and you are still that way! You promised to observe the Torah, and only later found it what it was, and you are still studying the Talmud like this. How do you know there is something there?” Rava answered, “We trust God as one who would out of love, not like you, whose distrust will be your undoing.” About us it says “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3004.htm">You have captured My heart, My sister, O bride</a>!” <br />
<br />
Ulla said, “How shameless is the bride who is unfaithful while still in her bridal chamber,” talking to Jews worshiping the Golden Calf while still at Mount Sinai. What is the connection? “While the King was still at His banquet, my perfume gave out its fragrance.” 
<br />
<br />
By association, another teaching about the word “shame”: Those who are shamed but do not respond, hear their disgrace but not do reply, who perform God's will out of love and are happy even in their suffering, to them applies the phrase “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0705.htm">But they who love God shall go as the sun in its strength</a>.”<br />

This is the mountain where God's hatred ('sinah') to idolaters was shown. Conversely, because of this the idolaters hate the Jews.”

<br />
On Yom Kippur, they would tie a scarlet strip of wool to the goat's head, and the wool would turn white, to symbolize forgiveness. This is connected to the phrase is Isaiah, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1001.htm">Go and lets us reason, God will say, if your sins are like scarlet, they will whiten like snow</a>.”  What does it mean? In the future God will say to the Jews, “Go to your fathers and let them rebuke you.” The Jews will say, “No! Abraham was foretold the exile, Jacob was foretold more exiles, and they did not pray for us, and Isaac blessed Esau.” God will say, “Since you rely only on Me, your sins will become white as snow.”

Since the time for it ends at sundown, there some activities that one should not start, lest he be absorbed in them and miss the prayer. Therefore, one should not sit down before a barber to have his hair cut close to the time of the Afternoon prayer, he should not enter a bathhouse or a tannery, nor may he begin to eat, nor may he start to judge a case of law. However, if he started any of these activities, he need not interrupt, but he may finish and pray after that.
<br />
<br />
Actually, there are two time limits for the Afternoon prayer: one can first say it already half an hour after midday, but the ideal time corresponds to the last afternoon sacrifice in the Temple, and it starts at three and a half hours after midday, closer to sundown. Which of the two time limits did our rule mean? If we say that it meant the early afternoon prayer, then why? – there is enough time left in the day! 
<br />
<br />
Not necessarily! It could be that the rule applies to the whole afternoon, and there are cases where one can be drawn into his activity and still miss the prayer. For example, the scissors of the barber may break, and he would be ashamed to walk around with only half of his hair cut; in the bathhouse he may become faint; in the tannery he may see rotting hives requiring immediate attention; a small meal may morph into a large festive one; and in judgment one may suddenly discover an error which will require him to the restart the case.

Shabbat 90 – Taking out food on Shabbat

How much food must one carry in a public area on Shabbat to transgress and be liable for a sacrifice? Seasonings - enough to season a chicken egg; various spices combine with one another to complete his liability. 
<br />
<br />
Food colorings, such as nut husks, pomegranate peels, and safflower, are enough to dye a small cloth on a woman's hat. Incidentally, if he takes out any of the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/nidddah-62-seven-cleansing-agents.html">seven cleansing agents used to wash away the blood</a> – enough to launder a small cloth on a woman's hat. However, Rabbi Yehudah finds a use for a smaller amount and says - enough to remove a blood stain.
<br />
<br />
Pepper and tar – any amount. However, this is not our common pepper, for that would be a spice, which we already discussed. This pepper - we don't know its identity. Metal, too, is considered useful in any amount since even the smallest amount can be used to fashion an instrument dangerous to life. Stones from the Altar are also important in any amount, and one violates Shabbat by carrying them. The same applies to idols' accoutrements, since they are all prohibited.

We also detailed the amount of food one must carry to incur liability, depending on the type of food.<p></p><p>Now, if he first stores food in a designated place, then his action shows that this stored amount is significant in his eyes. Then, he is liable for even a smaller amount of food if he carries it. Let's see the details.</p><p>If one stores a minute amount of seed for planting, or as a sample to show to prospective customers, or to use as medicine - and then he carries it to the street on Shabbat, he is liable. All other people, however, are only liable for <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/shabbat/shabbat90.html" target="_blank">standard amounts</a>.</p><p>If he (the one who stored the grain) decides against planting, the seed loses the importance he attached to it. If he carries it back, he is only liable for the standard amounts.</p><p>A dissenting opinion: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says that once the first person stores the food intending it for planting, anyone else becomes liable if he carries this amount. Thus, the thought of the first one made the second one liable.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Sower With Setting Sun - Vincent van Gogh</p><p><br /></p>

However, he is only liable for regular way of carrying.<p></p><p>For example, whether he carries objects in his right hand or in his left, in his bosom, or on his shoulders, he is liable because this was the normal way the priests carried objects in the Tabernacle. In general, the laws of Shabbat are determined by how things were done in the Tabernacle. Since building the Tabernacle was a model of construction for the whole world, "labor" is determined through that. On the other hand, if he carries it with his foot or in his mouth, in his armpit or in his ear, he is not liable for that.</p><p>In addition, if one carries an item above 10 handbreadths from the ground, he is also liable. But that is not a normal way of carrying?! - For the Levites, it is! We learn it from the Altar, which was 10 handbreadths high and which the Levites carried on their shoulders, leaving 10 handbreadths to the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>But learn it from Moses, who was 10 cubits (3 meters) high? And all other Levites must have been the same height? - Not necessarily. Perhaps Moses was much taller than the other Levites. After all, we have a rule that Divine presence rests only upon someone who is wise, strong, wealthy, and tall.</p><p>Art: Bedouin Women Carrying Water Jars by John Singer Sargent</p>

To be liable, one has to complete the action of a Shabat violation by "<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-27.htm" target="_blank">committing it that may not be done</a>." The grammar points to him committing the act entirely without any help.</p><p>What if the loaf was so big that neither one nor the other could carry it alone, and they had to carry it together?

Therefore, he is not violating Shabbat by carrying the container. Furthermore, if the amount of food is less than the violation limit (volume of a dried fig), he has not violated the Shabbat at all.<p></p><p>In the same way, if he carries a live person in a bed, he has not violated Shabbat because of the principle that a "live person carries himself," nor is he liable for carrying the bed because it is secondary to the person. "Live person carries himself" is explained thus: a person adjusts his weight and body position, and in this way, helps his carrying.</p><p>Finally, if one carries a corpse or an animal carcass or part of it - he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him because of the principle of "work that is not needed for its own sake." That is, he is not interested in having the corpse in the street; rather, he just wants it out of this home. For that, says Rabbi Shimon, he is not liable on Shabbat.</p><p>Art: Man Carrying a Boy by Paul August Renoir</p>

The Sages say that this is not how the work was done in building the Temple. Why would Rabbi Eliezer prohibit braiding the hair? God has "built" Eve out of Adam's rib, and the word "built" also means that he braided her hair and then brought her to Adam.</p><p>What if one plucks the flowers in a pot? Has he violated Shabbat?

In effect, one uproots from the home and lands it in the street, so it has the two elements of the transgression.<p></p><p>What if he hands an object over or throws it from one home to another, with the public street in between? Here, Rabbi Akiva makes him liable, while the other Sages do not. What is the argument about? Rabbi Akiva says that there is another principle: an object flying in the street is as if resting there. Thus, we view it as if having landed in the street. The Sages disagree with this principle.</p><p>But why is handing over forbidden at all? All kinds of labor needed for constructing the Temple are forbidden on Shabbat. And why - because the Temple is the microcosm of Creation. Since the Levites were handling beams from one wagon to another in building the Temple in the desert, this labor is forbidden.</p><p>Art: Girl Carrying a Basket by Winslow Homer</p><p><br /></p>

He could be carrying the wood, cutting it, or tying it into sheaves, which would all be prohibited labor on Shabbat. But what does it matter to us now? Well, it does matter. Of 39 labors, one is really not so strict - there was such a tradition. Since they did execute him in the end, the above is not non-strict.<p></p><p>Rabbi Akiba deduced that this man was&nbsp;Tzelafchad. Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira rebuked him on two accounts. If it was&nbsp;Tzelafchad, why did you, Akiba, reveal what the Torah wanted to hide? And if it was not him, you are maligning a righteous person. By the way, you should not suspect good people of wrongdoing. What if you did? - Give them a blessing.</p><p>The Talmud discusses various ways of prohibited throwing on Shabbat: from a house to a house with a street in between, or from a street to another street with a house in between. It makes a difference if we look at the object flying through the street as temporarily resting there.

These included daily offerings, Shabbat offering, wine, oil, the Bread of Vision, and other public offerings. A special problem was presented by the two loaves of bread brought on Shavuot when the year was Shmita. In&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;year, one cannot plow and sow, so they would have no wheat at the end of the year! Therefore, the Temple would hire guardians to shoo away the animals and ask passers-by not to interfere with the wheat that grew of itself, which would be used on Shavuot. These people had to be paid - and not because of the lack of volunteers, but because in guarding the wheat, they could accidentally pick up the produce, thus acquiring it. Then it would not belong to the congregation later on. However, if they were paid, even if they took the produce, they would do so on behalf of the congregation and would not acquire it for themselves. This important payment had to be done with the same shekalim.
<br />
<br />
Some money would still remain in the chamber, and, being that their mitzvah was already accomplished, the money could be used for the goat of Yom Kippur and for the city walls and towers. If any money was still left, the Temple could use it for commerce - says Rabbi Ishmael. However, Rabbi Akiva says that it would be degrading. He also says that surplus money from donations to the poor cannot be used for commerce but must be held for any contingency. Rabbi Akiva himself was a charity administrator.

Additionally, two handfuls of this incense were burned by the High Priest on Yom Kippur. If some of it remained after the end of the year in Nissan, when new shekels were brought, the old incense would become unfit. What did they do with it?
<br />
<br />
They would first exchange it against the money donated for the Temple's upkeep and designated it as payment for the artisans. Now the incense was completely deconsecrated. Then they would give the incense to the artisans as wages. They could not (and should not) use it because it is prohibited for personal use. Instead, it was bought from them with the new shekels. Thus, they bought the incense with the new money, and it became consecrated for use in the new year.

Shekalim 12 - Gifts to the Temple

In this case, we assume that his intention was the “fund for the upkeep of the Temple,” and they are used as-is, if it is possible (like a hammer or a ladder) or redeemed, and the money then goes to the Temple.
<br />
<br />
What if some of the items among his possessions were animals fit the for Altar? Since they achieved “Temple fund holiness,” they cannot simply be exchanged for a different, even higher, Altar level of holiness. Rather, the male animals are sold, and the proceeds are used to buy burned offerings, this being the highest level of sacrifice. The female animals, which are fit for peace offerings, should also be sold, and the money used to buy peace offerings. Again, this roundabout process is explained by the fact that one level of holiness cannot be simply exchanged for another. All this is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees and suggests we look at the intention of the donor. Since the donor surely wanted the highest level of service available, then the male animals should be offered as burned offerings - because this most likely was the donor’s intention. The female animals are more of a problem. Following the same logic, the donor probably wanted them too to become burned offerings. However, it is not possible with female animals, which can only be peace offerings. Therefore, since the donor's original intent is contradictory, we need to sell them and buy peace offerings with the proceeds. So here we agree with Rabbi Eliezer, albeit not with his reasoning. The Talmud continues with other opinions on what to do with the gifts.

Shekalim 13 - Wonderful administrators

For example, Petachia ben Pinchas was responsible for the box where the money for bird sacrifices was collected, Hugras the Levi was the conductor, and the family of Garmu was baking bread. Of course, the same people could not possibly be administrators for all 420 years of the Second Temple; rather, it is the righteous among them who were singled out by name. According to another opinion, these were their names in the generation when this rule was composed.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva was one of the greatest teachers, and he arranged the vast body of the Torah knowledge in divisions and groups to facilitate learning. His students also enumerated multiple laws together, such as "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/12/bava-kamma-2-four-categories-of-damages.html">four types of damages</a>," "<a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html" target="_blank">fifteen women who do not need a yibum</a>," "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/12/shabbat-73-thirty-nine-complete-list.html">thirty-nine labors on Shabbat</a>," and so on. 
<br />
<br />
And yet - said Rabbi Chaggai - the earlier generations have plowed and planted, weeded, threshed, winnowed, ground, sifted, kneaded, and baked knowledge for us, and we don't have a mouth to eat. This agrees with Talmud's principle that man's capacity for learning wanes with generations. If previous generations were like angels, then we are like humans compared to them. If they were as people, then we are like donkeys - and not even like the donkey of Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair.
<br />
<br />
And what is the story of this she-donkey? It was stolen by robbers but refused to eat stolen food. After three days, the robbers let it go, and it came back but still refused to eat. Rabbi Pinchas asked the inn-keeper, have you separated the tithes? The inn-keeper answered that the animals were not obligated to keep doubtful tithes' laws (d'mai). To that, Rabbi Pinchas answered that this was true, but she was very stringent with herself and accepted not to eat even doubtfully untithed produce. They gave her properly tithed food, and she ate.<br />

Shekalim 14 – The knowledge of foreign languages

Still, he is called Petachia (one who opens) because he knew all foreign languages (denoted as the symbolic number of 70 languages). Moreover, he could understand what people meant when they would mix these languages together.
<br />
<br />
Mordechai was one of the members of the High Court or the Sanhedrin. All judges in the Sanhedrin had to know 70 languages to understand the witnesses directly, not through an interpreter. Still, at least two judges needed to be able to also speak the languages. If they had four such judges, it was called an outstanding Sanhedrin. We should mention here that Shekalim is part of the Jerusalem Talmud. Babylonian Talmud has a more lenient opinion – that all judges together needed to know the majority of languages.
<br />
<br />
Another administrator was Nechunia, the digger of wells. He went to great lengths and expense for this, and there are miracle stories of his daughter being saved from drowning; nevertheless, his son died of thirst in a desert. This illustrates that God is exacting with the righteous.  Gevini was the Crier, and his announcements were heard for miles around.  Hugras the Levi was a conductor and a singer, and he had the ability to sing multiple notes simultaneously.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud also describes the families of incense makers and Temple bakers who kept their professional secrets and the checks and balances instituted in the Temple and in general for those with authority over the congregation, especially in money matters.

He would then take the token to the administrator over the supplies (Achiya) and receive the proper amounts. In the evening, Yochanan and Achiya would meet and reconcile the tokens and the money. If any money was lacking, Yochanan had to repay his own because of the rule that “Temple always has precedence.” There were four types of tokens for various groups of sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
There were two chambers in the Temple, the chamber of secrets and the chamber of tools. People who wanted to give charity would put the money in the chamber of secrets, and the descendants of good families who lost their wealth would come and secretly take it from there. The Talmud tells a few stories about the importance of giving charity and acting wisely so as not to embarrass the recipient. One of such stories: Rabbi Chama was strolling among the synagogues of Lod, and he told his colleague, Rabbi Hoshaya, “See how much money did my ancestors sink into these beautiful synagogues!” To this, Rabbi Hoshaya replied, “See how many lives did your ancestors sink! Were there no people struggling to study Torah that they could have supported instead?!”
<br />
<br />
The chamber of tools – anyone who wanted to donate an implement to the Temple would put it in this chamber, and every thirty days, the priests would open it and use the tools that could be used directly, while the rest was sold for the upkeep of the Temple.

There were a few items in the Temple with the count of thirteen: thirteen collection chests, thirteen tables, and thirteen places where people would prostrate themselves - only the members of the family of Rabban Gamliel prostrated fourteen times when visiting the Temple because they had a family tradition telling them where the Ark was hidden.
<br />
<br />
There was once a Kohen working in a wood chamber who noticed that one of the floor's stones was higher than the others. He went to tell his colleagues about the possible location of the hidden Ark, but he has not completed his statement and died.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud described various theories where the Ark was hidden and whether it was taken away to Babylon or not. Some say that there were two Arks, one permanent in the Temple and the other one taken to wars. In contrast, others maintain that there was only one Ark. It also describes the various opinions on the size of the Ark and the position of the whole and broken Tablets inside of it.
<br />
<br />
Anointing oil made by Moses miraculously extended its use for generations. Jewish kings were anointed with it if there was a disagreement about the next king, but otherwise, the anointment was not necessary; the High Priests, however, always had to be anointed. 
<br />
<br />
The Torah that Moses received from God was of black fire on white fire, as in verse, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=33#P5807">He brought the fire of a religion to them from His right hand.</a>”<br />

Shekalim 17 - Bow down thirteen times

When one visited the Temple, he had to bow down (actually, completely prostrate himself on the floor) thirteen times against each of the thirteen gates. The gates each had a name and some - a story connected to them. This, however, is the opinion of Rabbi Abba, but the Sages say that there were only seven gates. If so, what were the thirteen prostrations for - since the Sages agree to that fact? - The Sages say that after the Greeks made thirteen breaches in the Temple inner wall, and then the Hashmonaim (in the time of Chanukkah) repaired them, the thirteen bowing down commemorated that fact.
<br />
<br />
One of the Temple's gates was called “The Water Gate,” because, in the future,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2314.htm">a spring of water will issue at this place from Jerusalem</a>. The Talmud described how it will happen: from the Holy of Holies, the stream will be like the antennae of the smallest snail; then like locusts’ antennae, and by the time it goes out and connects to the rivers, lakes, and seas of Israel, it will be so powerful that a mighty vessel won’t cross it.
<br />
<br />
Back to the subject of Temple destruction, when Nebuchadnezzar came up to Israel, the Sanhedrin went out to ask him if the time for Temple destruction had arrived. He told them to give out their king. They told the king Yehoyachin about it, and the latter took the keys of the Temple and threw them to Heaven, from where they did not come back; and some say that a hand came to receive it. When the nobles saw it, they went to the roofs and jumped off there to their death. This is what Isaiah said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1022.htm">Why have you all gone to the rooftops</a>?”<br />

Eight of them, made of marble, were used for skinning and washing the sacrifices before burning them. Among others, one was of marble, and on it, they would place the Bread of Vision ready to be brought into the Temple; inside the Temple, the bread lay on a golden table, and after a week of staying inside, but still fresh and warm, it was taken outside and put on another golden table, to be distributed among the priests. Why did they not put it back on the marble table? - Because of the rule that we bring things up in their level, try to never take them down. Another question: why put the bread on a table of marble; wouldn’t silver be more dignified? The answer is that yes, it would be, but silver warms up, and the bread may spoil. But didn’t we say that there was a miracle with this bread anyway, and it would not spoil or cool down?&nbsp; Also true, but we try not to rely on miracles.
<br />
<br />
There were also thirteen collection chests in the Temple, called “Shofarot,” because they were in the form of a shofar, wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, to prevent people from taking money out of them while pretending to donate. They were for shekalim, new and old, and for various sacrifices. The “old shekalim” means someone’s obligation from last year - which cannot be used for this year but has to go into a separate chest and be used for the needs of Jerusalem instead.

If such coins are later found near the chests, we need to know what to do with them – because they had been designated for a specific purpose. The rule is like this: if, for example, the coins were found next to the “Shekalim” chests, we assume that they are for shekalim. If they were found closer to the adjacent “voluntary offerings” chest, we assume that they are for that purpose. If they are exactly in the middle, we take the more stringent view and put them in the voluntary offerings. Thus “close to” is a ruling principle, but we take the most stringent possibility into account in cases of doubt.<br />
<br />
In general, other coins found in Jerusalem, which might be designated for some special purpose, are governed by similar principles. For example, if coins are found next to animal dealers, we assume they have the tithe's holiness. This is because the people used to bring their tithe money to Jerusalem and buy grain or animals for their meals. Most likely, they did not have the chance to spend all the money and dropped the coins. However, if the coins are found on the Temple Mount, we assume they have no designation since we have no reason to assume otherwise. The majority of coins in the world are not designated for anything special.

Many things are done by the community on various dates in the month of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adar">Adar</a>. Thus, on the first of Adar, the Sanhedrin announced that everybody must prepare to pay the half-shekel. Every Jew would give half a shekel yearly; the money was stored in a Temple’s chamber, and the priest would use it to buy sacrifices. These were the daily sacrifices used to atone for everybody, so everyone had to take part in donating money for them.
<br />
<br />
Why was this announced on the first of Adar? – Because on the first of the next month, Nissan, the priests would go and take new money for the Temple’s needs. Each year needed “fresh” new shekalim, and the remainder of the last’s years coins were used for other needs. Thus, everybody was given thirty days to prepare the payment.

If one found an animal in Jerusalem's environments, then in the times of the Temple, it was most certainly an offering that got lost. If so, we need to determine what kind of sacrifice it was. If it is a male, we assume that it is a burned offering, but if it is a female, it is a peace offering.  But why?<br />
<br />
Granted that a female animal cannot be brought as a burned offering, we can assume it is a peace offering. But a male animal can be brought as a peace offering; why do we assume that it is a burned offering? The Talmud suggests a few explanations: we are really talking about a one who consecrates money, not an animal, or the teacher doesn’t mean that we really bring it as an offering, or maybe we exchange its designation. In the end, the Talmud finds all of them lacking. Finally, Rabbi Yakov suggests the following: the court makes a stipulation that if a sacrificial animal is lost, then its designation by the owner becomes invalidated retroactively, and now it transpires that it always was a burned offering. 
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then discussed other similar conditions that the Court made for the betterment of society. For example, if one finds an animal like the one above and returns the find to the Temple, it used to be that he would be required to bring the libations to go with it. On hearing this, people started leaving the found animals in place. The Court then stipulated that the money for the libations (wine and flour) should come from the communal funds, that is, shekalim.

However, in Jerusalem, people kept a higher standard, so spittle found there was considered pure - this is Rabbi Meir's opinion. Rabbi Yose, however, says that this depends on traffic. In the time of the festivals, when ritually pure people occupied the center of the streets, spittle found in the center was pure, but one on the sides - impure. On other days it was the reverse. The Talmud then discusses knives found on the way down to a mikveh, and on the way up from it, at different times and for different types of knives.
<br />
<br />
Rav Bisna wanted to know if the blood of killed animals makes one ritually impure and what amount of it, and he posed this question to Rav Bivi. However, Rav Bivi did not answer and even spurned Rav Bisna. Rav Bivi' colleague, Rav Zerika, asked him, “Is it because he asks you a question that you spurn him?” Rav Bivi replied with the phrase from the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=28#P5672">Your life will hang in suspense</a>” - is one who only has provisions for a year, and “you will not be sure of your life” is one who eats from hand to mouth and buys his food from the baker daily. Rav Bivi said that it applied to himself. This is why he did not have the presence of mind to answer.

Some say that 300 Kohanim was just an exaggeration, and perhaps this refers also to the cost. The Talmud also discussed how it was ritually purified in a mikveh and how other utensils were purified.
<br />
<br />
The mitzvah of shekalim applies only in the time of the Temple. What happens if one designates his shekel as the Temple shekel offering? – Even though the mitzvah does not apply, the shekel does become consecrated. What is he to do, seeing that there is no Temple where it can be used? – He must drop it in the Dead Sea. In truth, any sea will do, except that no boats were traversing the Dead Sea, and therefore there was no danger that the coins deposited there would be found and used. In the other seas, the coins have to be ground first.

Shekalim 3 – Also on the first of Adar

There is a parallel kilaim prohibition of wearing wool and linen together (representing Abel the shepherd and Cain the earth tiller.) The separation between the two helps rectify Cain’s murder, which somewhat explains the mitzvah.
<br />
<br />
Around the first of Adar is when the mixture of grains becomes visible above the ground. One can easily transgress this even unintentionally by having too much extraneous grain in the mix he sows. 
<br />
<br />
Some people did not listen to the court and kept their kilaim, so on the fifteenth of Adar, messengers of the court would go out and uproot the grasses to shame the transgressors. That did not help, though, since the farmers were glad that the messengers would weed the fields for them, and moreover, the farmers could use it as fodder. The court ordered to throw the grass on the road, but the farmers were still happy because they did weeding for them. Finally, the court decided that any field with kilaim will become ownerless, and anyone who uproots kilaim will obtain ownership of this field. This settled the matter.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud investigates why the courts have the authority over people’s possession and can make it ownerless.

Fifteen days after the money-collection proclamation, Temple-appointed moneychangers set their tables in Jerusalem and elsewhere - to remind the people about their obligation. On the twenty-fifth day, they would sit in the Temple since the time was very close to when the new money will be taken out to buy sacrifices. Later they would even take pledges until people pay. An appointed court official would enter the debtor's house, take a valuable object, and not return it until the half-shekels were paid.<br />
<br />
From whom do they take a pledge? From Levite, Israelites, and converts. Women and minors may donate if they want. They did not take pledges from the Kohanim for the sake of peace. Why? When a Kohen brings a flour offering, it can not be eaten but is <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=6#P2870">rather completely burned</a>. Therefore –&nbsp;reasoned the Kohanim –&nbsp;how can we donate money for sacrifices? If we do, some of the sacrifices that we normally eat would be prohibited to eat! Some even said that any Kohen who gives half-shekel sins. The Sages, however, claim that any Kohen who does not give half-shekel sins, since if he gives wholeheartedly, it becomes the property of the community and not his own.
<br />
<br />
Together with the half-shekel, one had to give a small coin (“kolbon”) to compensate for the half-shekel's higher price at the time of this collection. The Talmud discusses when this kolbon is required and when not, such as donating for another or two brothers paying from their common estate.

They were regularly emptied and transported to Jerusalem.
<br />
<br />
If, while being transported, the coins were lost or stolen, the agents who transported them would have to take an oath that they have not been negligent – and then they would be free of the obligation to pay. But, to whom do they swear? If money to buy sacrifices in the Temple has already been separated, then the condition was that the money on the way would also be included. Thus, in this case, the money was considered in possession of the Temple, and the agents would swear to the Temple's treasurer. However, if the accident happened before the money was separated, the agents would swear to the townspeople – and the townspeople&nbsp;would have to undertake another collection.
<br />
<br />
If, after being thought missing, the coins were found, then both the first and the second collection have acquired the designation of “half-shekel” and cannot be taken back; moreover, the extra coins cannot be used for the next year either, because they were designated for this year. What do they do? They put them in another collection box, called "Old shekalim." These monies were used not for sacrifices but for the betterment of the city of Jerusalem.

Even though his designation of the surplus coins was invalid since he did not need them in the end, the coins still became consecrated, and the money should be put into the collection box in the Temple, to be used when the Altar is idle – this is the opinion of Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel disagrees: Temple consecration in error is invalid, and the money remains his. If his declaration was, “I will bring my shekel from this money,” all agree that the extra money remains his. 
<br />
<br />
What if he was collecting money for his sin-offering and collected more than he needed? Here the surplus definitely goes to the Temple. Why? Because the cost of a sin-offering does not have a fixed limit, whereas the half-shekel does – so explains Rabbi Shimon. However, Rabbi Yehudah argues with his explanation and says that the half-shekel also is not a fixed amount: when the Jews just got back from Babylon, they donated the “darkon” coin, which is 4 times more valuable, then they switched to two times more, then to half-shekels, although never less than that. So it depends on the basic currency unit. Still, Rabbi Shimon answers that the half-shekel is fixed in the sense that all give the same amount. The Talmud describes other surpluses; for example, the Passover sacrifice's surplus money must be used for another Passover sacrifice.

Similarly, surplus money intended to redeem one captive should be given to that captive since he already acquired it through the hands of collectors acting as his appointed agents.
<br />
<br />A surplus of money collected for the poor should be given to other poor people, but a surplus of money collected for one person should be given to him. A surplus of money collected to bury the dead should be used for other burials. Still, if it was collected for a specific dead, then there are three opinions: give it to his heirs, make a monument for him, or keep it intact until Elijah the prophet comes and decides.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, only common people need monuments, but the righteous's teachings serve as their memorials and outlive the stone. Nevertheless, today is customary to build monuments for the righteous, not for their benefit, but for the living who will be reminded of them.
<br />
<br />
In the final analysis, &nbsp;charity and just deeds are better than the sacrifices and the money (shekalim) used for the sacrifices. People used to taunt King David, going next to his windows and asking, “When will the Temple be built?” – because it was known that it can be built only after King David's death. However, David would say, “Even though they want to anger me, I am happy with their words. I, too, would give up my life to build the Temple.” And nevertheless, God would say, “I will make your life complete, because one day of your life, David, with your charity and just deeds, are more precious to Me than the future sacrifices.”

All of the collected shekalim coins were deposited in a certain chamber in the Temple, and three times a year, they would scoop the money from there, before each of the three holidays: Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. These were also the times designated for separating the tithe of the animals. These times (about two weeks before each holiday) were established by the Sages for a few reasons: these are normal times when the animals bear their young; so that the people had the meat to eat at pilgrimages, and so that they would not delay their offerings.
<br />
<br />
Scooping was performed with three boxes, numbered aleph-bet-gimel, and some say with Greek letters, alpha-beta-gamma. The priest who performed the scooping did not enter with a hemmed garment, a shoe, a sandal, or any other box - to avoid the situation that if he would later become poor, people would say, “This happened to him because he stole!” and if he would become rich, they would say, “He became rich from the proceeds of his stealing!” This illustrates that one must strive to be clear of all suspicions, and even if he is clear in the  eyes of God, he must still strive to avoid suspicions in the eyes of men.

There was a procedure to the scooping: the priest would go into the chamber and call from there, “Should I scoop?” and the administrators would command him three times: “Scoop! Scoop! Scoop!” He would fill the first box and cover the money remaining in this part of the room with a hide; he would then fill the second box and again cover the remainder with a hide, and the third portion he would not cover. Why all this? The first portion was of the people of Israel, the second - for the surrounding cities, and the third - for the people of Babylon, Media, and far away lands.

The family of Rabban Gamliel was especially zealous: they would enter the chamber and throw the coins right before the priest doing the scooping, and he would try to make sure to scoop their coins into his box.
<br />
<br />
On this subject of extra effort, Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair outlines ten steps of spiritual growth: extra effort brings to being free from wrongdoing; that brings one to re-think his previous wrongful acts; this leads to holiness, that is, refraining even from permitted pleasures; this leads to humility; humility brings one to realize one’s shortcomings and to honest desire not to do wrong again; this brings to doing good beyond the letter of the law - which brings Divine inspiration in its wake; then he can resurrect the dead, and this, in turn, brings Elijah the Prophet, may he be remembered for good.

Shevuot 10 – For What Each Specific Goat Atones

<br />
Rabbi Shimon disagrees about the goats of the New Moon and says that they atone specifically for cases when one, while being pure, inadvertently eats impure sacrifices.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that the atonement of all he-goats is the same: they atone for inadvertent purity violations of the Temple and its offerings.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon Ben Yehuda has a different version of what Rabbi Shimon said: that the goats atone for a progressively wider range of infringements, from New Moon to Festivals to Yom Kippur. Said the Sages to him, "If they are so similar, can a goat designated for the New Moon be brought on Yom Kippur ?" He said, "Yes. Even though they are not the same, they have that in common: they deal with the purity of the Temple and its offerings.”<br />

Consecrated objects can be redeemed with money, and the sanctity transfers to money. Higher than this is physical sanctity: if the consecrated object can be used in the Temple service – for example, if it is an animal fit for the Altar, wine, flour, or incense – then it cannot, as a rule, be redeemed.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Ulla said in Rabbi Yochanan's name that daily offerings that are not needed by the community can be redeemed. Such lambs were present at the end of each Temple's fiscal year, when new half-shekels began to be used. <br />
<br />
Here is the procedure. The Temple treasurer borrows some funds, which are thus completely unconsecrated. He redeems the lambs, transferring their holiness to the money. This money is added to the old half-shekels and used for plating the Holy of Holies. The treasurer then repurchases the lambs with new half-shekels. Where does their holiness go? The court makes it a condition when consecrating the lambs in the first place that if they are not needed, they can be redeemed.<br />

We are forced to conclude that Rabbi Yochanan had a tradition from his teachers to this effect.<br />
<br />
But according to Rabbi Shimon, what do we do with the leftover lambs? We offer them as treats on the Altar. This agrees with Rabbi Shimon's view that offerings of a similar nature (in this case, they are burnt-offerings, totally consumed on the Altar) are interchangeable.<br />

Rabbi Yehudah the Prince has an exceptional opinion that Yom Kippur atones even for the person who does <b>not</b> repent (with three exceptions: denying the existence of the Creator, speaking insolently of the Torah, and refusing to be circumcised).&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But according to Rabbi Yehudah, how is it possible to deserve being cut off, which&nbsp;<a href="" target="_blank">the Torah promises for eating and working on Yom Kippur,</a>&nbsp;if the last moment of it affects atonement?</span>&nbsp;- It would apply to one who eats, chokes, and immediately dies in the middle of Yom Kippur, or alternatively to one who keeps eating at the end of Yom Kippur.<br />

<br />
Similarly, if he forgot about his impurity and visited the Temple, this is the second of the "two" cases mentioned in the Torah. If he remembered about the impurity but forgot about the Temple, this is the additional derived case.<br />
<br />
Asked Rav Pappa, what if he forgot about the laws of impurity?  - But what exactly did he forget? If he forgot whether it is a lizard or a frog that makes him impure, let him go and learn it with the children in school! Rather, what if he forgot the amount of lizard's meat that makes him impure on contact, is it like a lentil or more? What is the law? - This question remains unresolved.<br />

The High Court marches around the perimeter of the area being added, and the two loaves of the Thanksgiving offering in front of them, carried by the kohanim, and all Israel behind them. The Thanksgiving  loaves were used because they could only be eaten inside of Jerusalem, and they were huge, made with a few hundred cups of flour.

<br />
Those who say that a few attributes are sufficient say so because, in their view, Jerusalem's initial holiness lapsed with the Babylonian exile. Since Ezra did not have all the attributes but was still able to sanctify Jerusalem and the Temple, we see that not all attributes are needed.<br />
<br />
Those who say that all are required say so because, in their view, the initial holiness of Jerusalem continued through the Babylonian exile. If so, then why did Ezra need any sanctification at all? - Just for remembrance of the ritual.<br />
<br />
If one became impure while in the Temple and forgot about it, he is obligated to bring a "variable" offering. This is not mentioned directly in the Torah. However, since there are two separate prohibitions to enter the Tabernacle and the Temple while being impure, and the words Tabernacle and Temple are used interchangeably, the extra prohibition is applied to one who becomes impure while in the Courtyard.<br />

There are three kinds of bowing down are mentioned in the Scripture. "Kidah" means bringing one's face down to the ground from a standing position, with no more than his thumbs to support him in front. <a href="http://bible.cc/1_kings/1-31.htm">Batsheva was able to do it</a>, and the High Priest would attempt it on Yom Kippur in order to keep awake. "Keriah" is kneeling down, and "Hishtachavaah" means complete prostration on the ground, with arms and legs extended.<br />
<br />
Rava asked, "If one, upon being contaminated, suspended himself in the air of the Courtyard, not touching the floor, is he liable for an offering?" Does "tarrying long enough to bow down" imply being able to actually bow down, or does it not? - No answer is given to that question.<br />

<br />
Therefore, as Abaye said, he is liable to two offerings. But, as Rava asked, how could it be two offerings? If he is a Sage, and he knows the rules, then he may liable to bring an offering for the entry, but as far as exit – he is doing it deliberately, and offerings are brought only for mistakes! And if he is an ignoramus, this is all one big mistake, and he brings one offering! Rava himself answered his question, explaining that we are dealing with an incomplete Sage, who does not know the prohibition to withdraw immediately, which makes it for him an unintentional mistake.<br />
<br />
What should he do? He should "thrust his ten fingernails in the ground, like Joseph" (remain still until his organ becomes limp), and he is fortunate for having conquered his evil inclination.<br />

If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then, forgetting his oath, ate even a minute amount, he is liable – these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. The Sages told Rabbi Akiva, "Where do we find regarding one who eats a minute amount of forbidden food that he is liable?" There has to be a minimum amount!

However, one can derive the same two types of oaths related to the past, where the person swears that he did something, or didn't do it. If made inadvertently, all four types require the offender to bring a variable-type offering, which depends on his means.<br />

(Here the Talmud digresses from oaths to discuss other cases of "two that are in reality four." It will not come back to oaths until after eighteen pages.)<br />

Abaye say, "Yes," but Rava say, "No."<br />
<br />
They challenged both based on the following ruling. If one says, "It is hereby incumbent on me that I not eat meat nor drink wine, as on the day on which my father died (source for fasting on a yahrtzeit), or as on the day when Gedaliyah ben Achikam was killed (fast of the 3rd of Tishrei), or as on the day on which I viewed Jerusalem in its destruct "on" - he is indeed prohibited. Shmuel commented, "This is only true if he already vowed from that day on."<br />
<br />
This seems perfect according to Abaye: one attaches a vow to a vow, and in the same way an oath to an oath. However, it does not agree with Rava, who said that one cannot attach one oath to another oath! Rava will tell you that this ruling discusses a vow attached to a prohibited object (meat and wine), not an attachment to a vow, which, although mentioned, would be ineffective.<br />

Shevuot 21 – How Strict Is The Opinion of Rabbi Akiva?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2JikgNGgTyQXOKklX4yCnrCOc6nyfvF75lcA6WGae4VwXDFIdwWEYs2_eeNgcR5F-27p499IQQfzPKKULhjwmU9-G-LNNg_E2D51TVkW5lDTLqFvBgsyBEU3OdSvIG6q8Qz-xdEV4xas/s1600/Georges+de+La+Tour+-+Peasant+Couple+Eating.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh2JikgNGgTyQXOKklX4yCnrCOc6nyfvF75lcA6WGae4VwXDFIdwWEYs2_eeNgcR5F-27p499IQQfzPKKULhjwmU9-G-LNNg_E2D51TVkW5lDTLqFvBgsyBEU3OdSvIG6q8Qz-xdEV4xas/s320/Georges+de+La+Tour+-+Peasant+Couple+Eating.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">For the violation of the "I will not eat" oath, Rabbi Akiva obligates one for even a minute amount. Why is this? <br />
<br />
Is it because he follows the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who obligates one for any prohibited food for even a minute amount? If so, Rabbi Akiva should disagree in general and say to the Sages, "I obligate for any food violation, regardless of amount!" No, this idea is incorrect. Rabbi Akiva could simply be answering the Sages according to their words: "I say, one is liable for any amount of forbidden food. You, the Sages, who don't hold so, should at least agree with me in the instance of an oath, where he violates his oath, not just the food prohibition."<br />
<br />
It could also be that, in general, Rabbi Akiva does not follow Rabbi Shimon's opinion and obligates for eating forbidden foods only if a specific amount is consumed. Here, however, Rabbi Akiva says that the one who takes an oath, "I will not eat," means it in the ordinary sense of eating, and small amounts are included.<br />
<br />
The second explanation is the preferred one.<br />

Is it like all eating, a volume of an olive, or, since the earth is inedible, he means even a minute amount? - Remains unresolved.<br />
<br />
If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate and drank, he is liable for only one offering. But if one swore, "An oath that I will not eat and that I will not drink," and then he ate and drank, he is liable to two offerings.<br />
<br />
If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate prohibited foods, such as animals or foul that were not slaughtered correctly, unkosher fish, seals, frogs, flies, bees, mosquitoes – he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him because he swore to do something he is already obligated to do, and his new oath did not take effect.<br />

<br />
But why? Maybe all he meant was "no breads," and this is all one oath? - If so, he should have said, "I will not eat wheat, barley, and spelt." <br />
<br />
But maybe he meant to prohibit himself from chewing those grains? - If so, he should have said, "I will not eat <i>bread</i> of wheat, barley, and spelt." Instead, he included the word "bread" every time, thus separating his oath into three separate oaths.<br />

This meat was already prohibited to him before Yom Kippur. Now that Yom Kippur has come, it has brought with it an all-inclusive prohibition to eat this and other foods. The Sages make him liable for two prohibitions: eating unkosher meat and eating on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon, however, does not agree to the principle of inclusive prohibition and makes him liable only for eating unkosher meat.<br />
<br />However, what about the following ruling: for one act of eating, one can be liable to five offerings: an impure person who ate forbidden fat usually brought on the altar, beyond the time allowed for the sacrifice, from a consecrated animal, and on Yom Kippur. According to the principle of inclusive prohibition, why not add another one – an oath against eating fat? - We list only those prohibitions that existed by themselves, not the ones he creates.<br />

For example, if one swears, "I will give something to so-and-so," or "I will not give it to him," or "I swear that I gave it to him," or "I swear that I did not give it to him," this is an oath about others.<br />
<br />
If he said, "I swear that I will sleep" or "that I will not sleep," "I slept" or "I did not sleep" - these are oaths concerning intangible matters.<br />
<br />If one said, "I swear that I will throw a pebble into the sea," or "I will not throw the pebble," "I threw the pebble," or "I did not throw," - these are oaths concerning non-beneficial acts.<br />

<br />
Rabbi Akiva said to him, "If so, if you want to interpret the verse literally, then you only have oaths dealing with good and bad. What about neutral oaths, such as to throw a rock into the sea?" Rabbi Ishmael answered, "I get it from the extra inclusion of 'for anything that a person utters in an oath'". Said Rabbi Akiva, "This inclusion also includes oaths concerning the past!"<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva answered well! What does Rabbi Ishmael have to say? The teacher of Rabbi Ishmael was Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakaneh, the time's chief kabbalist, and Rabbi Akiva's teacher was Nachum Ish Gamzu, known for saying, "This also is for the good." They differed on which of the 13 rules of Torah interpretation is prevalent – the generalization/specification or the amplification/limitation.<br />

In the same way, if he swears to fulfill a mitzvah and does not do it, he is exempt. Oaths only apply to something that he has the freedom to do or not to do, and not to mitzvot, which one is obligated to do from the time of Mount Sinai. However, in the first case, he is liable to lashes for making a vain oath.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira wants to prove that one who swears to do a mitzvah and does not do it is liable, as follows. If in the case of an oath to do an optional act, one is liable for not doing it, then in the case of a mitzvah, which he is already obligated to do, how much more is he liable if he does not do it!<br />
<br />
But the Sages say oaths are only created if one has the freedom to promise to do or not to do something, and in the case of mitzvot, one does not have this freedom.<br />

Aifa studied oaths in the academy of Rabbah. His brother Avimi met him and asked a question, “If one takes an oath that he has not eaten today, and then repeats it, what is the law?” Aifa said, “He transgressed once.” “Wrong!” - said Avimi - “These are two false oaths.”<br />
<br />
Avimi asked another question, “An oath that I will not eat nine figs, an oath that I will not eat ten!” Aifa answered, “Liable for each oath.” “Wrong!” - said Avimi - “If he cannot eat nine figs, then he cannot eat ten.” <br />
<br />
Avimi asked a third question, “'An oath that I will not eat ten figs, an oath that I will not eat nine,' - and then he ate ten, what is the law?” Aifa answered, “He transgressed once, since the second oath is included in the first.” “Wrong!” - said Avimi - “The first oath prohibits ten figs, but allows nine, so the second oath is stricter than the first!” - and if he eats ten figs, he transgresses two oaths.<br />

If one swore to contradict something that is well known to people. For example, if he said that a stone column is made of gold, a man is a woman, or a woman is a man.<br />
<br />
Another  example of a vain oath is when he swore about something that is impossible for him to do, or which is prohibited by the Torah, and in this sense, impossible. Thus, if he knew a testimony and swore not to say it, it is a vain oath, since he is obligated by the Torah to testify if he knows a favorable testimony about someone. Similarly, it is a vain oath not to put on tefillin.<br />
<br />
For vain oaths, one is liable to lashes if the violation is willful, but he is completely exempt if he did it by mistake.<br />

<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/06/shevuot-oaths-2-two-types-of-oaths-that.html" target="_blank">That ruling</a>&nbsp;teaching increased liability could not be the opinion of Rabbi Ishmael or Rabbi Akiva. It could not belong to Rabbi Ishmael because he says that one can be liable only for oaths concerning the future, not ones about the past. <br />
<br />
Why could it not be the opinion of Rabbi Akiva? The other part of the "two that are four" ruling says, "There are two types of awareness of impurity that are really four. One can forget that he is impure and eat sacrifices or enter the Temple – these are two. The other two are when one remembers that he is impure, but forgets that these are sacrifices that he is eating, or that it is the Temple area that he is entering." We know, however, that Rabbi Akiva does not make one liable for the second type of unawareness.<br />
<br />
<i><b> Counter-argument:</b></i><br />
<br />
We could still say that the ruling is in agreement with both Rabbi Ismael and Rabbi Akiva, but for the other two transgressions, one is not liable to bring a sacrifice but only to receive lashes.<br />

If the litigant asks them to testify and they falsely swear that they do not know the testimony, they are liable to bring a "variable" offering when they admit that they lied. If the litigant has other means to win the case or has other witnesses, the liability for false oath does not apply.<br />
<br />
In addition to making a personal oath, one can answer “Amen” to someone saying, “I adjure you. " This also becomes an oath, as if he said it himself. In the case of the oath of testimony, if one repeats in court that he does not know the testimony after being adjured, this also becomes an oath.<br />

They are also keys to a deeper meaning. This mnemonic is for the four of the thirteen teachings that can be derived from the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/23-7.htm">Distance yourself from falsehood</a>,” and here they are<br />
<br />
* A judge should not defend his opinion about which he has doubts, merely to avoid embarrassment; <br />
* He should not have an ignorant student assist him in judgment;<br />
* He should not join another judge whom he knows to be a thief; <br />
* If he has discerned that the witnesses are lying, he should not continue to judge, internally putting the blame on the witnesses; <br />
* A student assisting a judge who sees an argument in favor of a poor man should not be silent about it; <br />
* If a student sees his teacher making a mistake, he should not wait till the teacher concludes the judgment, for the student to demolish it and get honor; <br />
* If a teacher tells his student “You know me, I won't lie. Someone owes me a maneh ($5,000), but I have only one witness – please be the second one” - the student should not be a witness;<br />
* Six more...<br />

A denial issued outside a court is not legally significant. However, if they denied knowing testimony in court, they are liable for each and every time they were adjured. Their single denial applies to each adjuration separately; thus, they are liable to bring five offerings.<br />
<br />
If he adjured them five times, this time in court, and they denied knowing testimony in court, they are liable for only one oath. Rabbi Shimon explained, "Why? Because, after denying knowledge of the testimony in court, they cannot retract and confess that they do know the testimony." Their denial in court of knowing testimony is itself treated as testimony, and the rule is that once witnesses give testimony in court, they can never retract or alter that testimony. Therefore, for the last four oaths, they are no longer eligible to give testimony.<br />

<br />
A claimant told two witnesses, "I adjure you to come and testify that I am a Kohen" - because this is not a monetary claim. Or he said "that I am a Levi," "that so-and-so is a Kohen," or "that so-and-so is a Levi."<br />
<br />
If he said, "That so-and-so raped another man's daughter" or "seduced another man's daughter." Although the rapist must pay damages and the fifty-shekel fine, and the claim is monetary, but in order to be liable, the witnesses need to be adjured by the claimant himself, to whom the rapist is to pay, not by another person.<br />
<br />
"That he ignited my stack of grain on the Sabbath," - since desecration of the Sabbath is punishable by death, this frees one from monetary liability even when he is not executed.<br />

<br />
Rabbi Eliezer:<br />
<br />
In <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">the verse about the oath of testimony</a>, the word "or" is stated two times, and in <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-2.htm">the verse about the oath of deposit</a>, the word "or" is also stated two times. This establishes the connection between the two, and just as the oath of deposits speaks only of monetary claims, so too does the oath of testimony speak only of monetary claims.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva:<br />
<br />
In the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-5.htm">When one shall become guilty regarding one of these matters</a>," the word "of" is a limitation, meaning that there are cases when one is liable and cases when one is not, and when is one liable? - in money matters!<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose HaGlili:<br />
<br />
"...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">and he is a witness who either saw or knew</a>." Which testimony can be established by either seeing or knowing alone? - in money matters!<br />

<br />
If one said, "I adjure you," "I command you," I bind you" (to testify) – the witnesses are liable.<br />
<br />
If they swore by heaven and earth, then they are not liable. However, if they swore by "Lord," by the Tetragrammaton, by the "Lord of Hosts," "Compassionate," "Merciful," "Slow to Anger," "Abundantly Kind," or by any of the subordinate Names of God, they are liable.<br />

If he swore falsely and subsequently confesses his sin, he must repay the principal plus an additional fifth and bring a "guilt offering" sacrifice in the Temple.<br />
<br />Although this oath applies to all types of debts, not just deposits, it is nevertheless called the "oath of the deposit" because a deposit is the first example mentioned in the Torah.<br />
<br />
The oath of deposit applies to both men and women, to non-relatives and relatives, to those who are qualified to serve as witnesses, and to those who are disqualified, in court and out of court.<br />
<br />
In truth, there is no reason to think these rules would not apply, but they are only stated to contrast with the oath of witnesses discussed previously.<br />

Shevuot 37 – Lashes and/or Sacrifice for the Oath of Deposit?

<br />
Usually, one gets lashes for willful transgressions and brings a sacrifice for mistakes. The oath of deposit is special, however, since one brings a sacrifice even for knowing violation of it. So then he is not lashed. Or maybe he is not lashed when there is no warning, but if there is a warning, he is lashed? It could also be both.<br />
<br />
They answered him based on a well-known ruling that the oath of deposit is more stringent than the oath of testimony, for one gets lashes for it. Therefore, they said, he gets lashes but does not bring a sacrifice.<br />
<br />
When they related this to Rabbah, he said, "Incorrect question!" If the witnesses saw him accept the deposit, the claimant can have the deposit back based on their testimony, and his denial carries no weight; therefore, it is not a true oath of deposit anyway! But Rabbah was later proven incorrect.<br />

<br />
The first case, partial admission, has its own additional limitations. This oath can be imposed only if the claim is for at least two silver maot (a volume of 32 grains of barley, about $10) and the admission is at least a prutah coin (half a silver barleycorn, under 25 cents). <br />
<br />
In addition, partial admission must be for the same kind. For example, if the plaintiff says, "You have two silver coins in my possession," and the defendant responds, "You have only one prutah coin in my possession," the defendant is free from an oath because the claim was for silver, and the admission was for copper.<br />

<br />
If the defendant says, “I will not swear,” he is immediately excused from court, owes money, and does not come back to change his opinion. However, if he says, “I shall swear,” those standing there recite the phrase “Turn away from the tents of these wicked men.” Even the plaintiff is considered guilty for causing an oath, since he should not have dealt with an untrustworthy person.<br />
<br />
The judges tell him, “You should know that the whole world trembled at the words 'Do not take the name of Hashem your God in vain'” And why is this? Because about a false oath it says, “God will not absolve.”<br />

This change allowed us to say that it could be the opinion of both Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiva.<br />
<br />
Why is this needed? When Rabbi Yehudah, the compiler of all Mishnaic rulings, formulates an anonymous ruling, he implies that this is the majority opinion and thus the final law. Without our (somewhat forced) explanation, we would have two major authorities disagreeing with the final law.<br />
<br />
However, there is still a problem with our answer. To receive lashes, the person must be warned. If he is warned, how can we talk about him being unaware that he eats sacrifices or that he enters the Temple?<br />
<br />
We are forced to retract our explanation about lashes. Rather, we now answer that Rabbi Yehudah the Prince compiles conflicting opinions of different Sages in one ruling. He does so because he wants to assemble together all cases of “Two that are four.”<br />

In contrast, Shmuel says that the claim itself must be for 2 maot. Then, if the defendant denies 1 perutah or admits one perutah, he is liable for an oath.<br />
<br />
Rava said: "The precise reading of the ruling indicates Rav's opinion, but the words of the Torah sound like the opinion of Shmuel." The precise reading of the ruling seems to agree with Rav, because it says that the minimum amount of "the claim" must be 2 maot, but never mentions how much the denied amount should be, which means that by "claim" the ruling means "the denial". The Torah, however, sounds closer to the opinion of Shmuel, when it says "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-9.htm">this is it!</a>" indicating that the amount of claim itself is essential when it is 2 coins.<br />

Shevuot 41 – A Borrower Would Not Outright Deny a Loan

<br />
The Torah assumes that no person would be so impudent as to deny a loan outright. After all, the lender did him a favor by loaning money interest-free (and other types of loans are anyway forbidden). When the borrower partially admits a loan, but partially denies it, this is just because he does not have all the money and plans to pay the balance later on. This is not right, however, and the Torah imposes an oath on him. But we cannot assume this in the case of complete denial.<br />
<br />
Later, however, this situation changed, and the Sages established an “Oath of Forgetfulness” even for cases of complete denial. However, this Rabbinical oath is different in that it can be switched: if the defendant does not want to take an oath, the plaintiff can take one and collect the money.<br />

Incidentally, for these things, one is not liable to a twofold penalty for theft, nor to  the fourfold and fivefold penalty for stealing, killing, and selling an animal.<br />
<br />
An unpaid custodian, who ordinarily must swear that he was not negligent in guarding an object entrusted in his care, does not have to swear regarding these things. A paid custodian, who is ordinarily liable for theft, does not have to swear and does not pay for those things.<br />
<br />
An oath requires a definite measure. For example, if one says, "I delivered a house full of produce to you for safekeeping," or "a purse full of money," and the guardian says, "I do not know how much you gave, but I am giving you back everything," - he does not have to swear. However, if he says that the produce reached the ceiling beam, and the guardian says it only reached the window, the guardian has to swear due to his partial admission.<br />

Shevuot 43 – Lender is Responsible for Collateral
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsY8Zo51JaOD1unGH3KbOnDQQ-Q0GOylgpACwS5yjlrSjqSE2w8dGK6ErFafTSntccq6zZzxyffWl7K2Ttcb1hYqSkcrAxzLYMulQHwCmg2BatOebkYzULddIZJTyQUw1bK4zIqIm3xr4/s1600/Hans+Thoma+-+Earth.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsY8Zo51JaOD1unGH3KbOnDQQ-Q0GOylgpACwS5yjlrSjqSE2w8dGK6ErFafTSntccq6zZzxyffWl7K2Ttcb1hYqSkcrAxzLYMulQHwCmg2BatOebkYzULddIZJTyQUw1bK4zIqIm3xr4/s320/Hans+Thoma+-+Earth.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one lends his fellow money on collateral, he is considered a paid guardian of this collateral. Therefore, should the collateral be lost or stolen, the lender is liable for it. If the collateral was worth more than the loan, the lender must pay the balance to the borrower, and if it was worth less than the loan, the borrower pays the balance to the lender. <br />
<br />
If the borrower claims that the collateral was worth the loan amount, and the lender says that it was less, the borrower is free from an oath, since there was no admission of partial liability. However, if the borrower says that he owes a balance, and the lender says that he owes a larger balance, the borrower has to swear. <br />
<br />
Who swears as to the value of the collateral? The one in whose possession it was lost, or the lender. If the borrower were to swear and not be careful in assessing the value, and the lender would later produce the deposit, the borrower would be disqualified from taking oaths and from testifying in court. This would be unfair, so the Sages shifted the oath to the lender.<br />

However, the Sages have decreed additional oaths, and as a result of taking these oaths, one swears and collects the money due to him. They include a hired worker, a victim of theft, a victim of assault, one whose opposing side is a suspect regarding oaths, and a storekeeper regarding that which is written in his ledger.<br />
<br />
What is the case of a hired worker? If a hired worker tells his employer, "Pay me my wages!", and the employer says, "I already paid!", but the worker says, "I never received them" - the worker swears that he has not been paid and then collects the wages. This oath is because the employer has many workers and may think he has already paid that one.<br />

The witnesses saw a creditor who entered the debtor's house to take something as security from him, without his permission. That is prohibited by the Torah, and one who takes collateral forcefully is considered a thief. The creditor then left with unidentified utensils under his cloak. The debtor can swear and collect his utensils. Of course, this law also applies to a full-fledged thief.<br />
<br />
Similarly, suppose witnesses saw that someone entered another's domain whole and left injured. In that case, since it is improbable that the victim would self-inflict those injuries, he can swear and collect damages.<br />
<br />
What is the case of a storekeeper with his ledger? If an employer tells the storekeeper, "Give my workers <a href="http://shmsoft.com/view/perm/talmud%20coins.jpg">two selah</a> in small change," and the shopkeeper says, "It is written in my ledger that I gave as you instructed." Still, the workers say, "We did not take anything from the storekeeper," they both swear and collect the payment from the employer.<br />

<br />
But why should this be so? Didn't we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/08/shevuot-oaths-44-sages-decreed-oaths.html">require the worker to swear about his wages in a similar case</a>? The answer is that in this other case, the employer may have forgotten which worker he had already paid. However, in the case of a wage dispute, the employer certainly remembers the stipulation.<br />

If, however, the plaintiff is also not trustworthy, then the rule is that "the oath returns to its place."<br />
<br />
What does "the oath returns to its place" mean? The Teachers in Babylon, that is, Rav and Shmuel, say it means that the oath returns to Sinai, where it was stated, "do not steal." The courts do not get involved,  and the one who is dishonest must fear Divine retribution.<br />
<br />
The teacher in Israel, that is, Rabbi Abba, says that the oath returns to the one who was initially obligated to take it, in order to free himself from liability. And, since he cannot swear, he remains liable and has to pay.<br />

Before collecting, they must take an "oath of heirs," which states that to the best of their knowledge, the debt was not repaid.<br />
<br />
However, as both Rav and Shmuel have stated, that is only true if the lender died first. If, on the other hand, the borrower died first, then the lender has to take a definite oath that the debt was not repaid. His children cannot take such a definite oath, but only to the best of their knowledge, and it is not sufficient. Thus, if their father dies, they cannot collect the money.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar in Israel disagreed, "Just because the lender's children cannot take the same oath as him, must they forfeit their father's debt?"<br />
<br />
In practice, the ruling of Rav and Shmuel was followed, but, since there was not a definite decision either way, if a judge ruled in accordance with Rabbi Elazar, his ruling would also stand.<br />

<br />
If his oath would change his obligation from one liability to another, such as that the ox he borrowed died naturally, when actually it was captured, and in both of which cases he would be liable to pay, his oath changes nothing. If he confesses that he swore falsely, he does not have to bring the usual sacrifice nor pay one-fifth extra. The same would apply if he swore to change from one exemption to another, or from an exemption to a liability.<br />

For example, if the owner of a house stands inside, takes an object, lifts it up, transfers it outside, and puts it in the basket of a poor person; or if the poor person takes the object from the owner of the house, lifts it up, and puts it in his basket. <br />
<br />
The Sages added two more prohibitions, where the action is done jointly. For example, if the house owner takes the object and lifts it up, and the poor person accepts it while outside, neither of them has completely violated Shabbat.<br />
<br />
There are also four cases of bringing an object in. This makes a total of eight, and is not parallel to the “two that are four!” To answer this, we count only those cases where one is liable for a Torah violation, and equate taking out to bringing in, because they are both, in essence, changing the domain, and you will get exactly two that are four.<br />

Two are mentioned in the Torah as “white spot” and “raised white spot.” Two more are derived from the word “additional,” meaning auxiliary shades of white. They thus make “two that are four.”<br />
<br />
“White spot” is white as snow; “raised white spot” is darker and is like white wool. The shade auxiliary to snow-white is that of lime of the Temple; the shade auxiliary to white wool is the color of egg membrane. The minimal size of a white spot that is considered significant is that of a lentil bean. Two primary shades combine with each for the size of the bean; auxiliary shades combine with their primary ones. This is analogous to two kings and their governors.<br />
<br />Yehoshuah, the son of Rabbi Akiva, asked, “Why not just teach that any shade that is whiter than the egg membrane is significant?” Rabbi Akiva answered him, “To test the Kohanim, who must be knowledgeable in the shades of Tsara'at, to judge.”<br />

<br />
If, however, he never recalls that he was impure, the goat that is brought as a sacrifice on Yom Kippur, and the day of Yom Kippur itself, suspends his punishment. When he finally finds out about his past impurity, he brings a “variable sacrifice.”<br />
<br />
But maybe the goat of Yom Kippur atones even for idol worship, prohibited relations, and bloodshed, because these are also characterized as “impure”? - No! Yom Kippur atones only “from impurities of the Children of Israel,” but not all impurities – these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Shimon derives the same answer from the context of Yom Kippur – it atones only for matters related to the Temple service.<br />

<br />
The goat brought on Yom Kippur suspends one's punishment for going to the Temple while impure. But if it does not erase it completely, how does the suspension help? Rav Zeira said, "By suspension, we mean that if the sinner dies before becoming aware of his transgression, he dies without this sin on his record."<br />
<br />
Said Rava to Rav Zeira, "The sinner does not need the goat sacrifice for this, for if he dies, then death itself purges him of his sin!" Rather, Rava said, "The purpose of suspension is to shield him from the suffering he deserves on account of his sin, until he becomes aware of it and gains complete atonement through his offering."<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">The goat sacrifice brought on&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">the New Moon atones for ritual impurities that never became known to the impure person. That is why this sacrifice is called "<a href="" target="_blank">a sacrifice for God</a>" - for God alone knows of this impurity -&nbsp;</span>these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah.<br />
<br />
Additionally, as Resh Lakish explained, God said, "This he-goat shall be an atonement for something that I did." When God created the Sun and the Moon, they were initially of the same size. The Moon complained that it was inappropriate for two rulers to rule at once, and God said, "You are right, go and make yourself smaller." The Moon then reasoned that it was unjust that it should suffer just because it raised a valid point. To placate the Moon, God promised that the Jewish people would bring a sacrifice for God's sin, as it were, on every New Moon.<br />

Usual flour offerings use wheat, but this one is made of barley. Regular offerings have oil and frankincense added, but this one is brought without. Why is it he, and not the wife, that brings it? – Because one should not be his or her own accuser. But why does the husband deserve this inferior sacrifice? – The wife is  unfaithful when the husband is unfaithful or gives another reason.
<br />
<br />
Proceeding, the Kohen brings an earthenware cup and pours in water from the purifying water of the priests. This large vessel stands in the Temple courtyard for the Kohanim to pour water on their hands and feet before they start their service. It is made of copper mirrors used by Jewish women in Egypt to look beloved to their husbands. 
<br />
<br />
How much water does the Kohen put in? Half a log, or about 5 ounces. Rabbi Yehudah says he takes only a quarter of a log or about 2.5 ounces. Parenthetically, Rabbi Yehudah will also require a shorter text to be erased into this water later in the preparation. The Kohen enters the Temple building, turns to the right, and finds a particular stone with a ring. He lifts up the stone, gets the dust from under it, and makes it float on the water.

Sotah 2 – Man deserves what he gets
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

If a husband becomes particularly jealous of his wife in regard to a certain fellow, he can warn her not to seclude herself with that fellow. If she does, she is suspected of adultery and needs to go to the Temple with her husband to be cleared of the suspicion. The Talmud will discuss the details of this warning, but first, it asks how the previous Tractate, Nazir, is connected to this one? 
<br />
<br />
The answer is that a man who sees such strife between a husband and wife should abstain from wine because he too may become involved in similar affairs, and often through wine. However, this is not a good reason because, in that case, Sotah should come first, and then Nazir. Rather, the connection is more roundabout: in Ketubot (Dowry),&nbsp; we mentioned one who vows in regard to his wife, from there, we went to discuss Vows (Nedarim) and then Nazir, which is a type of vow, and finally, we are back to Sotah, just as we said before, but in a different order.
<br />
<br />
In truth, man should blame himself for any marital trouble since the wife one deserves is in proportion to his own good qualities; in general, finding the right spouse is as hard in the eyes of God as splitting the Red Sea. But why should it be so hard? We know that the spouse is predestined for every person when he or she is born!? – When we say that it is hard, we mean the second marriage.

Sotah 20 – The importance of teaching one's daughter Torah

He then copies the words of the Torah concerning this onto a separate scroll. If she refuses to drink before these words are erased into the drink, the flour is burned as invalid, and the drink is poured out. If she refuses to drink after the scroll is erased, they help her, presuming that she is blameless, as she maintains, just became scared. 
<br />
<br />
If she and her lover actually committed adultery, then he dies in whatever place he is, and she dies in the Temple. However, if she has merit related to Torah, it will protect her for a year, two, or three. Because of this, Ben Azzai said that a man is required to teach his daughter Torah – so that this will protect her, even if she has a problem with her husband.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer, on the contrary, says that teaching Torah to women is frivolous. Incidentally, Kabbalah maintains that eventually, women will desire and get the opportunity to learn Torah. Baal Shem Tov founded a secret society for teaching Torah to women.

Why is all that? Because such people appear knowledgeable, but in reality, their opinions are not based on accurate knowledge. 
<br />
<br />
Also despised are those who pretend to be modest and turn their eyes away from women, and as a result, they may bump into a wall or hit their foot against a stone, but it is all just a pretense. Evil is those who say, "Tell me how I can improve, and I will do it," which implies that they have already perfected themselves in their estimation.
<br />
<br />
King Yannai (who killed all members of the Sanhedrin) bequeathed this to his wife: not to be afraid of the Sages' vengeance because they are righteous and will not do wrong, and neither be afraid of the followers of King's Yannai sect, because they esteem her. She should only be scared of false people who pretend to be righteous like Pinchas, but their deeds are licentious as those of Zimri.

We mentioned that the paramour of the suspected wife does not go unpunished. What is the source of this statement? – In the phrase "The waters will go," the word "will go" is mentioned twice, once for her and another time for him. So whatever happens to her in the Temple also happens to him - in whichever place he is.
<br />
<br />
The other word that is repeated is "became prohibited." Why is that? The first time it tells us that after the husband warns his wife and she nevertheless hides away with a specific man, the husband cannot live with her any longer; he must either give her a divorce (Get) or take her to the Temple to be cleared of suspicions. The second repetition applies to the paramour – should he desire to marry the woman after the divorce, he cannot because she is also prohibited to him. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva derives the same law from an extra "and" (letter vav in Hebrew), that is, "<b>and</b> the waters will go." Many more laws were expounded by Rabbi Akiva and others on that day. What is the story of "that day"? It is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/09/brachot-28-that-day.html">the day mentioned in tractate Brachot</a>&nbsp;when the Sages removed Rabban Gamliel from his control over the Sanhedrin and changed the policy of allowing only strictly selected students into the study hall. Now anybody who wanted could come in. As a result, many talented students could offer groundbreaking insights.

Sotah 28 – Laws of purity

Laws of purity are learned from the laws of a suspected wife. Here's how. Her innocence is in doubt because she went into a private hiding place with a particular man. But her purity would not be in doubt if she was talking with him in public.
<br />
<br />
In the same way, if there is a doubt about some other purity, such as, for example, a man who might have touched a dead rat, the question now is whether he is considered ritually impure. If this happened in the street, he is declared pure; if it occurred in a cave, he is impure. This unusual law goes beyond the regular rule of "let's treat it as a doubt." There is no doubt that he is definitely pure in the street but impure in the cave.
<br />
<br />
Another law can be learned by noticing that a suspected wife is a human being who can be asked about her status. So with other situations, the distinction between happenings in the street and in a cave applies only to a human who can be questioned. For example, he is unsure whether he touched a rat. Then the rule about the street or cave applies. But if he is sure that he touched the rat, and the doubt is about the rat itself, such as whether it was alive at this time or already dead – then he is always declared pure because a rat cannot be asked.

Sotah 29 – Can you ask him?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Earlier, we saw a difference in the laws of purity between humans, whom you can ask about the situation, and inanimate objects that cannot be questioned. If a doubt about purity arises in a yard (or another private area), then if it is about a human, who can be queried, he is declared impure. But if it is about a piece of meat, for example, then it is declared pure. We learned this law from the purity of a suspected wife, but there is yet another source for it.
<br />
<br />
“<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7#P2896">If sacrificial meat comes into touch with something impure, then it cannot be eaten; otherwise, a ritually clean person may eat it</a>.”&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The beginning of the phrase says that impure meat is not eaten. So we understand that doubtfully impure meat can be eaten. But the end talks about pure meat that may be eaten. And we can derive that doubtfully pure meat cannot be eaten. So now we have two contradictory indications, whether one can eat doubtfully pure meat. You can only explain it if you say that the doubt is prohibited when it refers to a human, who can be asked, and allowed if it refers to the meat itself, which obviously cannot be questioned.
<br />

Sotah 3 – Is jealousy good or bad?

Is that jealousy good or bad? Some say it is forbidden for a man to warn his wife this way. He should always try to maintain peace. A warning of this sort will lead to strife between the husband and wife or a conflict between her and her neighbors. Others say jealousy is caused by the spirit of purity and is good. 
<br />
<br />A long time ago, the spiritual level of men declined. Since men were not blameless themselves, the test of a suspected wife stopped working. 
<br />
<br />
Even when circumstances warrant this, Rabbi Ishmael only permits a man to warn his wife, but Rabbi Akiva makes it an obligation. They have also disagreed similarly in another matter: a Kohen is not allowed to go to a cemetery and become ritually impure. However, he is allowed to do it for his relative. Here too, Rabbi Ishmael says that he is only allowed to do so, but Rabbi Akiva says he should insist and bury his relatives.

Sotah 30 – Purity, Song at the Sea, and other sundry questions

We mentioned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/11/sotah-27-just-as-she-so-is-he.html">one special day saw many novel interpretations from newly-admitted students</a>. The list continues with Rabbi Akiva's rule of the degrees of ritual impurity.
<br />
<br />
Actually, a thing is either pure for Temple service or not. However, the Sages classified the impurity into six levels, from the dead body (called the grandfather of impurity) down to the "father of impurity," the first level, the second level, and all the way to the fourth. For example, some say that if you have a dough from which the priest portion (challah) needs to be separated, then this dough has the same law as the challah itself and can become impure with third-degree impurity. Others say that since the challah has not separated, the dough can only become impure in the second degree, not the third. 
<br />
<br />
Another point that Rabbi Akiva explained was the way the Israelis sang the Song at the Red Sea. He said that Moses sang the phrase, and they repeated the summary. Others – that they repeated the phrase itself. For example, Moses said, "I will sing to God," and they repeated, "I will sing to God." Then Moses said, "Since He is exalted," but they said, "I will sing to God." Others say that they repeated, "Since He is exalted."

Sotah 31 – Parrot

If he hears that she did seclude herself with the man, even as told to him by a parrot, he then needs to divorce her. This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who says that we would even believe the husband himself, so once the husband is sure about the seclusion, his warning is triggered. However, he has to pay her the money of the Ketubah since he does not have any proof,  and it was his fault that he got into this situation.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua says that the evidence of seclusion must be more substantial: if the affair is the talk of the town, so that women who get together to weave and chat at night discuss this, then the situation is certain to the point that the water drinking test will not work anyway. It is not, however, certain to the point of her losing the Ketubah, so in that situation, the husband still pays. 
<br />
<br />
If seclusion is established, she gets exonerated by drinking bitter water in the Temple. However, there are also witnesses that cohabitation has taken place during seclusion. In that case, again, the water test is unnecessary; this time, she gets divorced and loses the Ketubah. This witness can be anyone who usually needs to be a better witness. Even those five close female relatives, like her mother-in-law, who would not be believed to testify about the death of her husband (because of their vested interest in her downfall) are believed here. Except if these five women testify to cohabitation, she still retains the Ketubah payment right.

Sotah 36 – Why to learn languages

<br />
<br />
By contrast, the blessings and the curses that the Jews pronounced before entering Israel, on the mounts Eival and Grizim, had to be said in Hebrew because these it is described as "And they will answer and say" – and the same words ("answer and say") are used when doing <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html">chalitzah</a>, which has to be done exactly as written, in Hebrew.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then describes how the blessing and curses were pronounced, what else happened on the day when the Jews crossed the Jordan River and entered the Land of Israel, and about the Torah, which had to be written on stones in seventy languages, in precise translations, for everyone to know.
<br />
<br />
It then turns to Joseph, who knew seventy languages, as mentioned in the story of his appointment to be viceroy. He was given a test by Pharaoh, and he replied in every language that Pharaoh spoke. But how did he learn all of them? – Angel Gabriel visited him the night before and taught them. Joseph would go up one step on the way to Pharaoh's throne with each language. In the last step, he spoke in Hebrew, and Pharaoh could not answer. Pharaoh made Joseph give an oath not to reveal this.<br />

May God make His presence enlighten you and grant you grace. May God direct His providence toward you and grant you peace."
<br />
<br />
They say these three phrases outside the Temple, and the people answer "Amen" to each one. They also say the Name of God not as written, but using a changed form called "Adnut" and denoting ruler or master. 
<br />
<br />
In the Temple, they said the blessing as one long phrase, without an interruption for "Amen." In the Temple, people, as a rule, did not say Amen, but responded with a longer term; here, this phrase would interrupt the blessing. Moreover, in the Temple, the Priests pronounced the Name of God as it is written, in the form that implies "was, is, and will be." The exact pronunciation of it is not known today.

The warning is really for both, and later consequences may befall both. Now if they do hide, suspicion has grounds, and the husband is not allowed to continue living with his life normally any longer but needs to clear her of the suspicions in the Temple.
<br />
<br />
How long do they have to hide? - Enough to do the thing. What thing? - Cohabitation. And what is that? – We <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/11/yevamot-56-what-is-legally-considered.html">learned before that the beginning of it</a> – the touch of the genitals – is sufficient; the disagreement was only about was is considered a touch.<br />
<br />
So how long is that? Rabbi Ishmael said, “The time it takes to mix a cup of wine.” Rabbi Yehoshuah said, “Time to drink it.” Ben Azai said, “Time to fry an egg.” Rabbi Akiva: “Time to swallow that egg.”  Chanin ben Pinchas said, “The time it takes her to put a hand into a basket and take out a bread.” The Talmud discusses these and other opinions and changes them; for example, “Time to drink” really means “Time to mix and then drink.” It also wants to know what kind of bread, wheat or barley, warm or cold, and what type of basket, but does not find an answer. 
<br />
<br />
Every opinion came from personal experience, except perhaps for Ben Azai, who was never married, because Torah study took all his time. Then how did he know? Some say he married but separated, some – that his teacher told him, and yet others – that God tells His secrets to those who are aware of Him.

Sotah 40 – The humility of Rabbi Abbahu

Why? Is there a servant who will remain silent and not express his appreciation while being blessed by his master?
<br />
<br />
An opposite point of view: people should be silent. Is there a servant who will keep talking while he is being blessed instead of listening?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Abbahu said, "Initially, I used to say these phrases during the blessing of the Kohanim. But once I saw Rabbi Abba from Akko being silent, I also stopped talking." Rabbi Abbahu continued, "I thought that I had real humility. But once I observed the following behavior of Rabbi Abba. He was delivering a lecture to  a large audience, and his helper – whose task was to repeat the lesson in a loud voice and explain it – was giving different explanations for the same points as Rabbi Abba mentioned. Nevertheless, Rabbi Abba said nothing to him! Compared to him, I do not have humility."<br />
<br />
Then why did Rabbi Abbahu think initially that he had humility? Because of the following incident. Rabbi Abbahu also had a helper to loudly repeat and explain his lectures. The helper's wife told the wife of Rabbi Abbahu that her husband (the helper) had as much knowledge as Rabbi Abbahu, and he showed obeisance just to be polite. The wife of Rabbi Abbahu took affront, but Rabbi Abbahu told her, "It does not matter! Between the two of us, we ensure the people learn Torah."<br />

When the army approaches the enemy, he talks to the soldiers and says the following words, speaking in Hebrew. How do we know that he is talking in Hebrew? Because of the term, "he will say (vediber)." The same word describes Moses, "and Moses said, and God replied with a voice." Since Moses spoke to God in Hebrew, the Kohen at war also spoke in Hebrew.
<br />
<br />
He says, "Listen, Israel (Shema, Israel!), you are approaching an enemy." He uses the word "enemy" to emphasize that if Jews were fighting against Jews, as it happened between the tribes at times, they could expect the victors to be merciful with the captives. He then quotes historical episodes to prove the point. However, with enemies, it is not like that; they will not pity you. This understanding caused them to fight with all their might. 
<br />
<br />"They come against you with human might, as Goliath. You, however, will win, like David did, because your God is walking with you."
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said, "Why is God walking with them? – because they say the 'Shema' prayer, just like the Kohen at war mentioned. From here, we see that if only all Israel said 'Shema' in the evening and in the morning, they would never fall into the hands of the enemies."

Anyone who built a new house but has not lived there should return. This applies to buying a home, not only to building it, and the type of house can also be a barn, woodshed, or any other livable structure.<br />
<br />
Anyone who planted a vineyard and has not used it (this includes three years of it being "orlah" and the fourth year after that) - goes back. And anyone who has engaged to a woman but did not get married to her - goes back to his wife and spends a year with her. Finally, anyone who is scared also goes back. He may feel that he did something wrong, and therefore he does not have the merit to win in war. Other reasons are mentioned first so that people who are afraid do not have to be humiliated by admitting it.<br />
<br />
However, these exceptions apply only to voluntary wars that Sanhedrin approves for national reasons. If enemies wage war against Israel with the intent to harm, it is a mitzvah for everyone to participate.<br />

Sotah 44 – What is there to be afraid of?

Some people are soft-hearted, and they may lead the army to lose its morale, contributing to defeat. This is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yosi HaGlili says he is "afraid and fainthearted" because of his transgressions. For example, he may have spoken between putting on the head and arm tefillin. Or he spoke between the second part of morning prayer (Yishtabach) and the third one – the blessing of Shema. This category is then placed at the end so the transgressors won't be embarrassed, and people may think they claim other exemptions. 
<br />
<br />
After that, the army should be steadfast. Strong soldiers are put in front so that if any of their brothers fall, they help him stand up. Strong soldiers are also placed in the back: if anyone wants to run away, they have authority and axes to stop him – because running away is the beginning of defeat, just as it happened when the Israelites first ran away from Plishtim and <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a04.htm">then were defeated</a>.

When Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa died, there were no more people of good deeds, and after Rabbi Akiva,&nbsp; there were no more supporters of the Torah, and the wells of wisdom were closed. 
<br />
<br />
After Rabbi Yehudah the Prince died, there was no more humility and fear of sin. However, when this teaching was recited in his academy, Rav Yosef corrected the students and told them that there was still genuine humility because he was there. Similarly, Rav Nachman said to take out “no fear of sin” since he was yet alive.<br />

Sotah 5 – Haughty or humble?

Moreover, when someone is arrogant, God says, "This world is too small for the two of us," or more precisely, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a1.htm">One who is haughty and proud – him I cannot bear (says God)</a>."<br />
<br />
And yet, a Sage must have a small measure of haughtiness. How much? One-eighth of one-eighth. And for a Sage, it is an ornament, like the upper part of a wheat stalk. Rava said, "One who has it is damned, and one who does not is damned." But it is better to err on the side of humility.
<br />
<br />
When one prays, though, she should definitely be humble. Following this, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2651.htm">Humble spirit is like God's sacrifices</a>," – which means that prayer with a humble heart is equal not to a specific one but to all sacrifices together.<br />

Why? The Torah instructed to live in a sukkah, not in a sukkah under another sukkah, and incidentally not in a sukkah under a tree or inside a house. But maybe the logic is just the opposite: the Torah told to live in "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=23#P3442" target="_blank">huts</a>," so sukkah atop another one is just right! - Look at the spelling of the word "sukkot," it is missing a vav, which implies singular.<p></p><p>Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that if there are no tenants in the upper sukkah, then the lower one is valid. That is hard to understand: the sukkah should be valid on its own merits, and the tenants should not matter! Maybe Rabbi Yehudah means that the upper sukkah is not livable? But then it's hard to understand the logic of the first few view who validates the top one.</p><p>The truth is that they only argue in the marginal case where the upper sukkah is livable but very shaky. The Sages say that the sukkah must be a temporary dwelling, so the top shaky sukkah is good. Rabbi Yehudah insists that one should make the sukkah his dwelling for seven days, and people don't live in shaky dwellings, so he validates the lower one.</p><p>The cottage by Van Gogh</p>

However, until now, we had no definition of what valid s'chach is. We will give it soon, but first, let's look at some additional rules.<p></p><p>If one adds a sheet to his s'chach, the sukkah is invalid. He may have put the sheet above the s'chach to protect from excessive sun. Or, he may have put the sheet beneath the s'chach because of the falling leaves. The sukkah is invalid because now the sheet serves as a covering; the s'chach serves no purpose - and is considered non-existent.</p><p>If he smartly used the grapevine or ivy and, without cutting the branches, lifted that and added them to his s'chach, it is invalid - because the sukkah should be made from the "leftover of the threshing floor and winepress." He can cut the branches now, and it will be valid.</p><p>The rule: s'chach should be made of material that cannot become ritually impure. Therefore, it cannot be made of food, utensils, or clothing. The s'chach material must also grow from the soil.</p><p>Art: Cottage with Peasant Coming Home by Van Gogh</p>

When a part of the s'chach next to the sukkah's wall is made of material that is invalid for s'chach - such as a board - it can still be valid. You just look at this part of the s'chach as a continuation of the wall and call it a "bent wall." The result is that one cannot sleep under this part or eat under it - the normal use of s'chach - but the sukkah is valid.</p><p>Now let's go back to boards that are not next to the wall and therefore are not considered a "bent wall." If the board is wider than four handbreadths, all agree that it invalidates the sukkah. If it is narrower than three handbreadths, all agree that it is just a stick and is valid. The boards that are between three and four handbreadths are in dispute. Rabbi Yehudah says that they are OK - because any significant "place" should be at least four by four handbreadths, and they are less than that. Rabbi Meir says that any hole that is less than three handbreadths is considered "glued," following the principle of "glue," "lavud." And these boards are wider than this, so they invalidate the sukkah.</p><p>But what is wrong with the boards in the first place? It turns that the roofs at this time were made of boards four handbreadths wide. So, if one uses such boards, he may come to simply sit at home. And we want him out in the sukkah.</p><p>Art: The Tree of Crows by Caspar DavidFriedrich</p>

Why so strict? - Firstly, he has not built it for the sukkah, and the requirement is that he should make it for the Holiday and not use something already there. Now it should be kosher, but if we allowed that, people might eventually come to use their houses as a sukkah, and so to prevent this, we require him to remove every second board. All this is the opinion of Beit Shammai. However, Beit Hillel School is not concerned that people may use their houses as sukkahs, and they do not require taking out the boards. Practical law is even more complex because Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehudah have different versions of what Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel were arguing about.
<br />
<br />
If one covers his sukkah with metal kebab spits, they are invalid for many reasons: they are utensils and are thus susceptible to ritual impurity, and they don't grow from the ground. Both conditions are necessary for the proper sukkah covering (s'chach). However, if there are spaces equal to the thickness of the spits and he puts proper s'chach there, it becomes valid.
<br />
<br />
Can we deduce a principle from here that exactly half of valid s'chach makes the sukkah valid, and in general, exactly half of the permitted matter (such as in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/03/eruvin-2-houses-courtyard-alley.html">eruv</a>) makes all permissible? - Maybe not; perhaps here he left a little more space between the spits than their thickness, so we cannot derive anything from this case.

Even though these boards are not utensils and therefore do not accept impurity and should be valid yet, since they originate from a utensil (bed), the Sages decreed not to use them.
<br />
<br />
If one hollows up a cavity under a haystack to use it as a sukkah, it is not valid because this hay was already there before, and he did make it for the sukkah. However, if initially, someone left even a small opening under the hay, then he can dig some more and live there: the initial opening qualified as a sukkah – if it was constructed for shade – and he just completed the necessary height.
<br />
<br />
If one left his wall hanging and not reaching the ground, this is OK, provided that they are within the three handbreadths from the ground and small goats cannot enter his sukkah. In fact, if his sukkah is only 10 handbreadths high, he can use such a hanging wall that is only slightly more than four handbreadths, right in mid-air. If it is closer than three handbreadths to both the floor and the ceiling, we apply the principle of “connect” (“lavud”) and consider the missing three handbreadths both above and below as if they were present.

Consider the following three cases.
<br />
<br />
1. If one took away the center of his house's roof and placed s'chach on top, this is a valid sukkah –&nbsp;provided that no more than four amot (about six feet) remain from the s'chach to the wall.<br />
<br />
2. If a courtyard with many houses with porches is roofed with s'chach – it is a valid sukkah, provided that the porches are no wider than four amot.<br />
<br />
3. A large sukkah covered with kosher s'chach in the middle is valid if the remaining invalid s'chach is no wider than four amot.
<br />
<br />
These cases seem repetitive, but each one is, in reality, needed. Had we been told the first case but not the second, you could argue that in the first case, the walls of the house can be imagined as bending inward, and the s'chach is thus valid because of the principle of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/02/sukkah-4-fixing-height-of-sukkah.html">“bent wall,” or “dofen akumah</a>.”&nbsp;However, you could say that the porches and their walls don't bend outwards in the direction of the courtyard.
<br />
<br />
And had you been told cases 1 and 2, you could still argue that in case 3, the sukkah does not have bent walls but rather invalid s'chach, and that invalid s'chach for sure cannot be considered a continuation of the wall. Now that the teacher stated all three cases, he prevented these possible incorrect deductions.

Sukkah 18 – The edge of the roof

We can apply the principle of “the edge of the roof makes a wall,” or more literally, “the edge of the roof comes down and closes the opening.”
<br />
<br />
Imagine that one has suspended his sukkah roof (“s'chach”) in a courtyard surrounded by porches. It has no walls. If the porches are wider than four steps (amot) each, we have just <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/02/sukkah-17-holes-in-roof.html">declared such sukkah invalid</a>. However, Abaye argues that the edge of the roof of each porch makes a wall for our sukkah!
<br />
<br />
How can Abaye argue with the clear-cut rule above? – He tells us that we misunderstood the situation: there, the sukkah's roof was flush with the roof of the porch. But if they are at different heights, we can extend the edge of the roof of the porch and imagine it is the sukkah wall.
<br />
<br />
Earlier in <a href="http://talmudilluminated.com/eruvin/">Eruvin</a>, we had a similar disagreement concerning a pavilion – does its roof's edge come down and make a wall (which would permit carrying in it on Shabbat). Perhaps Rav, who said that it does, &nbsp;lends support to Abaye in this case? – No, perhaps he does not: in the case of the pavilion, its own roof could serve as its wall, but here in the case of sukkah, we want to use the roofs of the porches – may be here even Rav would not say that it is valid.

Sukkah 19 – Circular, conical, and reed mat sukkah

The Sages, however, regard it as one large sloping roof, and it is valid. Some say that the logic is correct, but the attribution is the reverse – Rabbi Eliezer says what the Sages say, and vice versa.
<br />
<br />
If one wants to use a reed mat to cover his sukkah – a very convenient way, rather than messing with the leaves and branches – will it be a kosher s'chach? – A small mat is made for lying down on it, and it is thus a utensil; since all utensils are susceptible to ritual impurity and therefore cannot be used for the sukkah covering, the small mat is not kosher. However, with large mats, it depends. If it was made originally for lying down, it is a utensil and cannot be used. Still, if it was made for covering the sukkah – then it is not a utensil in the normal sense of the word, does not accept ritual impurity, and therefore is a kosher sukkah covering.

The Sukkah should be a temporary dwelling reminding him of the similar arrangements his ancestors had in the desert after going out of Egypt. Some say it reminds him not of the physical dwellings which the Jews used in the desert but rather the Heavenly clouds that surrounded them wherever they went.
<br />
<br />
According to either reason, Sukkah must be a temporary dwelling, and its height cannot exceed twenty amot (about thirty feet). Why? If he builds the Sukkah that is higher, he must make it much stronger. Thus his Sukkah would be invalid. Some say that in a Sukkah that is high, he simply does not see its roof and forgets that he is in the Sukkah.<br />
<br />
When we learned about Shabbat, we had a similar limitation: the height of an eruv bar, reminding people of the Shabbat boundaries where one cannot carry things also had to be less than twenty amot, but there one had to lower it. Why, when talking about Sukkah, we say that it is invalid if too high, but about eruv, we are given the advice to lower it? The details of the Sukkah construction are too numerous; thus, our teacher preferred to say that it is simply invalid rather than offer all possible corrections.<br />

This is also true of eating and drinking, but the teacher chose to talk about sleeping because even a brief nap is not permitted outside the sukkah while eating a snack is allowed.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon tells a story to support this view. Tavi, the slave of Rabban Gamliel, was a Torah scholar. He was once sleeping under the bed in a sukkah, and Rabban Gamliel remarked to the Sages: “Do you see my slave Tavi? He knows that slaves are not obligated in the mitzvah of the sukkah (although they have to do many other mitzvot), and therefore sleeps under the bed!” 
<br />
<br />
Why does Rabbi Shimon attract our attention to the word “remark?” – To tell us that Sages never chit-chat, but that even their casual remarks require study. Why? – King David <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2601.htm">compares a scholar to a tree planted near a stream, which yields fruit in season</a> (students and teachings) and whose leaves (lighthearted remarks) never wither (that is, contain sap of knowledge).<br />

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/03/sukkah-20-in-sukkah-under-bed.html">Earlier, we said</a> that being under the bed in a sukkah is not considered fulfilling the mitzvah of the sukkah and quoted a precedent for this. But why not? Usually, a bed is lower than ten handbreadths; it is not considered a roof to shield us from the sukkah's roof and should be nullified! You are right; this is correct: there is no argument in the case of a low bed; one can sleep under it. However, the teacher was talking about a tall bed.
<br />
<br />
And yet, Rabbi Yehudah quotes a precedent that goes in the opposite direction. He says, “We were sleeping under the bed in a sukkah in the presence of the Sages, and they did not say anything.” Now we need to explain Rabbi Yehudah's point of view. Rabbi Yehudah will say that even though the bed looks like a tent, it is made to lie upon it, not to hide underneath it, and thus it does not qualify as a regular tent with a roof, regardless of geometry. Alternatively, the explanation may be that according to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/02/sukkah-8-sun-and-shade.html">Rabbi Yehudah's own opinion</a>, sukkah has to be a permanent steady dwelling. A movable bed is only a temporary shelter, so the steady roof of a sukkah is considered a proper roof, while the bed is not, and we can ignore it.<br />

Some say that by “meager,” we mean that the s'chach is on two levels, even beams lower and odd beams higher. This is valid because we apply the principle of “throw down” and regard the upper s'chach as being on the level with the lower one. This is similar to the “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/02/sukkah-18-edge-of-roof.html">edge of the roof coming down</a>,” only called a different name here.
<br />
<br />
On the other extreme, if a sukkah is covered with too much s'chach so that the stars cannot be seen through it at night, it is not ideal but is still valid. In fact, even if the s'chach keeps out the sun's rays in the daytime, it is also valid, albeit only according to Beit Hillel.

If one makes his sukkah on top of a wagon – it is valid since it is definitely only a temporary dwelling.
<br />
<br />
If he makes it on a ship, it is valid too. It once happened that Rabbi Akiva and Rabban Gamliel were traveling on a ship, and Rabbi Akiva made his sukkah on top of it. The following day a wind blew and toppled the sukkah. Said Rabban Gamliel, “Akiva, where is your sukkah now?” However, he was not taunting; rather, in Rabban Gamliel's view, a sukkah on top of a ship is invalid. Why? – Because it cannot withstand the strong sea winds, and is thus as if non-existent. If so, what does Rabbi Akiva answer? – He says that if it could stand on land, that is enough permanence, which is valid.
<br />
<br />
If he makes his sukkah on top of a tree, this is valid, but since one cannot climb trees on holidays, one cannot go up into this sukkah on the first day of Sukkot (a Holiday.)<br />
<br />
If he makes a sukkah on top of a camel, it is valid between the camel's humps, and here too, he cannot go up into this sukkah on the holidays. Some say that the sukkah should be equally fit for all seven days of Sukkot and, since here he cannot use it on the first day, it is invalid for the rest. The Talmud continues with discussions of when live animals can be used for walls or coverings, or even for <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/search/label/Gittin">writing a Get</a> on them, and what the problems with this might be.

However, Rabbi Meir says that the Sages decreed not to do this. Why not? The animal may die, and in doing so, bring its height to less than ten handbreadths. One may not notice this and continue sitting in a sukkah that is not kosher. According to this, an elephant, which is high enough even in death, would make a valid partition.
<br />
<br />
But is it Rabbi Meir's way to be concerned with improbabilities? For example, if one buys wine that may not have been tithed and needs to drink it on Shabbat, he can separate the tithe in his mind and do it physically after Shabbat – and there Rabbi Meir is not concerned that the wine bag will break and leave him with no tithe! - He will answer that it is more likely for an animal to die than for a wineskin to break. 
<br />
<br />
But is Rabbi Yehudah not concerned with the possibility of death? Why, on Yom Kippur, he prepares <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/11/yoma-13-another-wife-for-high-priest.html">another wife for the High Priest – lest his wife will die</a>! – He will answer that Yom Kippur is special.
<br />
<br />
So you are saying that you are concerned about the animal's death, but otherwise, the animal could be a wall? If so, it is a utensil and can receive spiritual impurity. Why then does Rabbi Meir consider it pure even when used as a coffin cover? Because of this objection, we take away all of the previous discussion and say that the real reason why an animal cannot be a wall is that Rabbi Meir requires walls made by man's hands in a sukkah.

They didn't. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rav Acha bar Yakov stated that any partition that moves is not valid. What about our sukkah, which is surrounded by trees whose branches are always moving! - Rav Acha will answer that we don't know all the circumstances: the rule only applies if he has tied the tree branches with interwoven branches of palm trees. Thus, the permission that we had suddenly becomes very limited.
<br />
<br />
One who is busy with a mitzvah – such as traveling to study Torah, greet his teacher, or redeem a Jewish captive – does not have to observe the mitzvah of sukkah. Why? – Since he is busy with one mitzvah, he should not abandon it to do another one. And how do we know this principle? – Since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5088">When you sit in your home</a>." This is said about reading the "Shema" prayer, but it teaches us a general principle: one only has to do a mitzvah if he is “sitting in his home” and is not busy with another mitzvah. But maybe the Torah is talking about one who is sitting in his home and is already doing a mitzvah – which would then teach us precisely the opposite, namely, that one has to drop a mitzvah and do another one!? – No, the Torah said an extra word, “your” home, to teach that you are busy only with your affairs. Quod erat demonstrandum.

Rav Mesharshia objected: that's not an explanation - guarantor needs his own guarantor, and your overseer may fall asleep as well! Rather, one should not nap outside the sukkah because even a nap refreshes him and counts as sleep. With tefillin, the concern is that he should not pass gas, and that won't happen while catnapping.</p><p>Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai was extra strict with himself and ate and drank even small amounts only in the sukkah. Nevertheless, this kind of strictness is permitted and is not considered presumptuous.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Sick Child by J. Bond Francisco</p>

Sukkah 27 - Fourteen obligatory meals in the Sukkah

This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. What is his logic? One should live in the Sukkah like at home, and just as at home, he eats a day meal and an evening meal; he must do the same in the Sukkah.<p></p><p>The Sages disagree: only the first evening meal is obligatory. What is their logic? Don't they agree that he should live in the Sukkah? Yes, they agree, but their logic is different: just as at home, eating is not obligatory but is his choice, so in the Sukkah, he is not obligated to eat. But if so, why is the first meal required? - They compare Sukkot to Pesach. Just as Pesach starts on the fifteenth of the month and <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/10/pesachim-108-drinking-wine-and-eating.html" target="_blank">the first meal - matzah</a> - is required, Sukkot also starts on the fifteenth, and the first meal is required.</p><p>Furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said that if one missed the first meal in the Sukkah, he can compensate it by eating another meal, and even on the Holiday right after Sukkot, which is called Shemini Atzeret, the Eighth-day Holiday. But how could Rabbi Eliezer say that - one is not allowed to sit in the Sukkah for an extra day! - By then, Rabbi Eliezer changed his mind. He agrees that fourteen meals are not required, and now he argues that one can fulfill his obligation after Sukkot, just as it is true on the eighth day of Passover.</p><p>The Prayer Before the Meal by Jan Steen</p>

Could it be that one should own the sukkah as well? - No, all Israelites can sit in one sukkah because it says, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=23#P3442" target="_blank">All the natives in Israel will sit in a Sukkah</a>," that is, they can sit in one sukkah.<p></p><p>The sukkah should be big enough to contain his head and most of the body, but the table can stay outside. The School of Shammai disagrees: the table must be inside, or else he might be drawn after it and eat outside the sukkah. Now they bring evidence. The Sages from both schools once visited Rabbi Yochanan ben HaChoranit and found him sitting in a sukkah with the table outside and said nothing. But they disagree about this evidence: the School of Shammai says that the Sages spoke up and told him, "If this is how you always conducted yourself, you never fulfilled this mitzvah in your life!'</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Palm by Pierre-Auguste Renoir</p>

Nice clothing? - Bring them to the sukkah. In general, he should eat, drink, and relax in the sukkah.<div><br /></div><div>One cannot deny, however, that sukkah is not conducive to deep concentration. Where should he study, inside or outside?

Sukkah 3 – The smallest possible sukkah

They asked him, “But this is the opinion of Beit Shammai, and we know that whenever Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai argue, the law is always like Beit Hillel!?” He answered, “And what should I do? In this case, Beit Shammai is correct.”
<br />
<br />
Note, however, that the table is inside the sukkah. This leaves room for a more lenient opinion: a sukkah that is so small that it only contains his head and body while the table is outside is still valid. That, indeed, is the opinion of Beit Hillel. 
<br />
<br />
What if the sukkah is pretty big, but the table is still outside? Would this be valid or not? It turns out that Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai are consistent with their own opinions: Beit Hillel permits it, while Beit Shammai says he does not fulfill the mitzvah. What is then the basic underlying reason for their disagreement? - Beit Shammai says that the Sages instituted an additional law and disqualified a sukkah with an outside table out of concern that he will get drawn after the food on the table and will, in fact, eat outside the sukkah. Beit Hillel disagrees and says that there is no such concern.

One of these is a palm branch (lulav.) However, if he stole his lulav, it is not kosher, and he has not fulfilled his obligation.<p></p><p>Why is that? Since the Torah said, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=23#P3440" target="_blank">You shall take <i>for yourself</i>, on the <i>first day</i> of Sukkot holiday, palms tree branches</a>," they should belong to yourself. And stolen branch does not belong to the thief. However,&nbsp; this only resolves the matter for the first day. What about the second day?</p><p>Rabbi Shimon, the author of the Zohar, gives the rule: it would be a good deed brought about through transgression, which is not valid. But why is this so? Why not say that the end justifies the means? It is because of this: "<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2401.htm" target="_blank">You bring the stolen, the lame, and the sick animal - shall I accept it</a>?" Just as lame cannot be fixed, so stolen is forever disqualified.&nbsp;</p><p>But let's analyze this further. The thief steals the goods. The owner has not given up and hopes to get them back. At this time, the object does not belong to the owner, and a mitzvah that should be done with one's own object is invalid. But later, when the owner despairs, the object belongs to the thief! And yet, Rabbi Shimon declares it invalid. This tells us that one cannot do a good deed through transgression.</p><p>This opinion is not unanimous. Shmuel disagrees and says that it depends on the situation. He says that just as you can borrow a lulav and thus make it yours for performing the commandment, so is the stolen lulav valid starting from the second day of Sukkot and later.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cunning Thief by Paul-Charles Chocarne-Moreau</p>
