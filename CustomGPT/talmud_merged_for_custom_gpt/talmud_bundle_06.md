Does that mitzvah count for him?&nbsp;<p></p><p>How does one steal the sukkah? He does it by evicting his fellow out of it and then sitting there. Alternatively, he can build his sukkah on public land, thus stealing it from the public.</p><p>The land is different from movable objects because usually, we say that it cannot be stolen. Someone may occupy it, but the owner still hopes to eventually get it back, so effectively, one does not steal the land but squats on it. Rabbi Eliezer says that the mitzvah does not count because the sukkah should belong to you, just as the lulav. The Sages argue and say that there is no requirement that the sukkah belongs to you; you can sit in the sukkah of your fellow.</p><p>This is different from stealing the wood to make the sukkah. A certain elderly lady came to Rav Nachman and said that a group of powerful people stole her wood and are sitting in a stolen sukkah. He told her that all she can claim is the cost of the wood but that the sukkah is theirs. This has to do with another law. If one steals a beam and builds it into his house, there is an additional enactment that he does not have to return the beam because it would mean destroying the house. This was enacted to benefit the people who would repent and want to return the stolen goods - but not destroy the house. Now, this enactment worked against the lady. Rav Nachman told the students, "She is just a crier."</p><p>Art: Opportunity makes the thief by&nbsp;Paul-Charles Chocarne-More</p>

Each student saw his teacher doing this, and the Talmud had no doubt about the species. Even though it was therefore known by tradition, the Talmud tries to derive the exact specification from the words of the Torah. For example, could one use clusters of dates (palm fruit) instead of palm branches and wave these? In every case, it confirms the species using the spelling of the species name or the idea that it should be nice and beautiful and cannot be poisoned or prickly.<p></p><p>The myrtle twig (hadas) has the same requirements as the lulav: it cannot be stolen or dried out. The myrtle has a plaited (braided) appearance, and it should maintain its looks. If leaves fall off it and it loses its looks, it is invalid. It may also have berries growing it, which is OK. However, if the berries outnumber the leaves, it is invalid. One can take the berries off, and it will become valid again. However, taking the berries off is not allowed on the Holiday itself because it "fixes" the myrtle and makes it valid. What if one went ahead nevertheless and took the berries off on the Holiday? Can it now be used? The reader is invited to advance arguments for and against.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Myrtle in a lobed-footed vase by&nbsp;Tomas Hiepes</p>

One waves them in all six directions. The four types of branches or fruit have similar laws, but the teacher enumerates them separately because of some differences between them. One should preferably procure the best.
<br />
<br />
The willow branch – if it is stolen – is invalid. That is because the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=23#P3440">Take for yourself</a>,” which means – it should be yours, not stolen. If the willow branch is dried out, it is also invalid because it is no longer beautiful.
<br />
<br />
If one cuts off a branch from a tree that was grown to worship it, it is invalid. As an object of idol worship, it should be burned, and therefore even now, it is regarded as having zero dimensions, whereas a certain minimal size is required. However, if it only withered or a portion of its leaves fell off, it remains valid. 
<br />
<br />
Earlier, we mentioned how many of each type is required. However, Rabbi Akiva has a different logic: just as citron and palm branch are one, willow and myrtle must also be one. What about the first teacher? – He derives the required numbers from the spelling of their names.

Sukkah 35 – Etrog, or citron
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Etrog (citron) is one of the species in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/03/sukkah-34-branches.html">Sukkot bunch</a>. However, since it is special in that it has taste and smell, its requirements are more strict. For example, the laws of orlah (fruit that is not eaten for the first three years) apply to it, and thus an etrog in the first three years is invalid. Technically, this is because, by law, it will be burned and thus is considered to have zero measurements even now.<br />
<br />
If the etrog is the priest's portion (terumah) and is ritually impure – it is invalid because one cannot eat it. If it is the priest's portion and it is pure – then one should not take it so that he does not make it impure, but if he does – it is valid.
<br />
<br />
But how do we know that “etrog” is citron in the first place? Since the Torah calls it “beautiful tree-fruit,” we understand that it comes from such a special tree whose branches also have the taste of its fruit – and that is citron. But perhaps it is pepper? - No, that could not be: if you take just one pepper, it is too small. And if you take two or three – the Torah said to take one fruit, not two or three. Thus it must be citron.

Sukkah 36 – Etrog must be beautiful

However, if it was punctured with a needle but is complete, it still looks good, and therefore it is valid. 
<br />
<br />
Rava asked a related query: “What if its internal part has rotted away, similar to a rotting lung? Would it be kosher?” On the one hand, the etrog looks good and similar to a lung that has rotten in the internal tissues; it may still be valid. On the other hand, a lung is completely protected from the outside air and thus does not rot further, but an etrog is open to elements and might deteriorate more. The Talmud tries to find proof from the law of a spoiled etrog but discards this attempt because perhaps that spoiling was from the outside, and Rava is asking about the inside. The question thus remains unresolved. 
<br />
<br />
If one grew an etrog in a mold, and now it does not have the regular etrog shape – it is invalid because it is atypical. However, it is valid if he reshaped it, and the new shape is also characteristic of an etrog.
<br />
<br />
If mice punctured an etrog and made a hole in it, it is invalid. But Rav Chanina would dip his etrog, eat a piece, and then use it, and it was still valid!? - A mice bite is different because it is repulsive to people, and this is not beautiful.

Rabbi Yehudah even considers this a necessary requirement: the branches must be bound together. Thus, the material that you use to tie it together is part of the mitzvah. If so, it must be one of the same four species that you are tying – otherwise, you are adding to a mitzvah and taking together five species, and not four, and the Torah said, “Do not add to the mitzvot or subtract from them.”
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Meir says that the binding is not strictly required; thus, it is not a mitzvah, and the binding can be made of any material. In fact, the important people of Jerusalem were using golden threads. What does Rabbi Yehudah answer? The gold was on top of the branches for beautification, but the real binding was done with one of the four species, most likely a lulav leaf. 
<br />
<br />
Similarly, Rabbi Yehudah permits to make sukkah only out of the same four species. His logic? Here it is: sukkah is more stringent than the lulav bunch since it applies both day and night, whereas lulav is only by day. Therefore, if the lulav bunch can have only one of the four species, the sukkah must certainly be made of the same materials. And what did the Sages answer? That this logic, seemingly strict, is, in fact, lenient and thus does not apply. If he does not have the right materials, he may ignore the sukkah and go live at home – which is unacceptable lenience; thus, the logic is incorrect.

However, the Sages added the requirement to also wave the bunch in all the directions of the world and up and down. This is to show that one is doing it for the sake of the One to whom all directions of the world and heavens and earth belong. Another explanation: to protect from harmful winds on all sides, which shows that even the non-essential parts of a mitzvah (such as waving, which is not obligatory) have the power to stop bad things from happening.
<br />
<br />
If one was traveling on the road and did not have the lulav, he can wave it when he comes home, at the table – since he can take the lulav all day. The waving of the lulav is done while reciting the praises of God and gratitude, called Hallel. One should preferably say the Hallel himself, but if he does not know, then others, even if they are not obligated, can recite it for him, and he will answer “Amen!” He deserves a curse, though, for he should have learned it himself.

When one buys a Sukkot bunch from his fellow on the seventh year (Sabbatical, or&nbsp;Shmita), then – since the etrog that he is buying is a fruit, and fruit should be treated with special care on the&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;year – he should only pay for the lulav, the palm branch, and&nbsp;ask for the etrog to be given to him as a present. Why? – his fellow may not be all that knowledgeable in the laws of&nbsp;Shmita. He may not know how to deal with the money from this sale.<br />
<br />
What if the fellow does not want to give him the etrog as a present? – Then he should include the price of it in the price of the lulav branch. Some say that the price should be high enough, so his fellow does not mind and verbalize that he is giving a present. Others – that it is enough for the buyer to have it in mind.
<br />
<br />
But why go through all these machinations, let him give the fellow the money outright!? – As we mentioned, the fellow might use the money to buy non-kosher foods or non-food items and be unaware that this is the wrong use of the&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;money.

What if one's sukkah is higher than that, and he decides to pile pillows and blankets on the floor? Unfortunately, we tell him that it does not help because he plans to remove them later, and so they are regarded as non-existent even now. What if he says, “I abandon these pillows here, for the seven days of the holiday?” - No use either because most people would not do such a thing, and his decision is nullified by the rest of the world's opinions. However, if he puts straw and abandons it, or better yet, he spreads dirt – this helps, and his sukkah becomes valid.
<br />
<br />
If he puts up a platform inside his sukkah, it also helps to reduce the height. He does not even have to put it right next to the walls; he can distance the platform up to 4 amot (6 feet) from each wall, and it will still be valid because we will regard each wall as a “bent wall,” ("dofen akumah"), one that first goes up, then bends horizontally, transforms itself into a roof, and remains a valid legal partition.
<br />
<br />
A sukkah that is too low can be fixed by digging the floor. Here, however, he needs to dig all the way, almost next to the walls, and not four amot from them as he did above, because the concept of “bent wall” only applies to bending the roof, not bending the floor.

Sukkah 40 - What is the difference between the palm branch and a citron?

But why? If etrog is subject to&nbsp;Shmita, so&nbsp;should be the lulav! Well, lulav did not begin growing in the fifteen days between Rosh HaShanah and Sukkot, when&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;really started.  But then the same can be said about the etrog! – No, the difference is that for palm tree, its&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;starts when it is planted – which is before&nbsp;Shmita, but for etrog – at the time of picking it,&nbsp;which is on&nbsp;Shmita. 
<br />
<br />
The last explanation may work, but it seems artificial. Why do we even need to use it? The difference is simpler: citron is food, and palm branches are not. So the laws of&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;apply to one but not to&nbsp;the other. Actually, this is not so obvious. The laws of&nbsp;Shmita&nbsp;are defined as “for you, it will be for food.”&nbsp;This includes foods, but it also includes anything that is for you, anything at all. How do we reconcile this? – We include anything like food. Just like with food, the act of destroying it and enjoying it comes at the same time, so for example, ointments are also included. But palm branches are excluded because we burn them now and use their hot coals for cooking later.

Sukkah 41 – Remembering the Temple and building it again

The Torah said, “on Sukkot, take the bunch and rejoice for seven days before God" - that is, do it once, but in the Temple - all seven days. After the Temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai decreed to take the bunch all seven days to remember how it was done in the Temple. 
<br />
<br />
What is the source for the idea to remember the Temple? – Since Jeremiah said, “This is Zion, nobody is looking for it,” we see that there is a mitzvah to look for and remember the Temple. 
<br />
<br />
He also decreed to keep the Temple in mind on the day after Passover, when the Omer offering used to be brought. This offering permits <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/05/menachot-68-remembering-temple.html" target="_blank">newly grown wheat to be eaten</a>. The confusion may arise on the year when the Temple is built, and to prevent it, Rabbi Yochanan delayed eating the new grain for one day.
<br />
<br />
However, how can the confusion arise at all? If the Temple is built after the 16th of Nissan, then the new wheat is already permitted. And even if it was made before, the new grain (chadash) should be allowed right after midday because if the Temple stands, they would have brought the Omer already.
<br />
<br />
The answer: the Temple may be built at night on the sixteenth or just before sundown on the fifteenth. But this time is either night or a holiday, and one cannot construct the Temple at these times!? – True, but this applies only to the first two Temples, whereas the third one will come down miraculously from Heaven, following the verse, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=15#P1938" target="_blank">The Sanctuary, my God, that Your hands established</a>.” Others explain this differently.

Shabbat is an exception: if one carries it to a Sage to learn the details, he will violate Shabbat, so there is a decree not to touch it at all.<p></p><p>That is today. However, in the time of the Temple, they would take their lulav (that's how the bunch is called for short, by the name of the most prominent species) even on Shabbat. To accomplish it, they would bring it to the synagogue before the Holiday, and in the morning, each would recognize his lulav and take it into his hands. In fact, the people of Jerusalem would never put the lulav down, all the time that it was possible, out of their love for the mitzvah.</p><p>After one has waved his lulav, he can put it back into the vase, which is not prohibited because of the law of Shabbat or Holiday. When a child can wave a lulav, he should be taught to do it. In fact, a child is gradually taught to do a mitzvah once he is ready. When he knows how to talk, the father should teach him Torah. What phrase should he teach first?

For example, the mitzvah of the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/03/sukkah-34-branches.html" target="_blank">Sukkot bunch</a> (lulav) could be done for either six or seven days. How so? Since the Holiday of Sukkot lasts for seven days, there invariably will be a Shabbat during Sukkot. However, when this Shabbat coincides with the first day of Sukkot, they would wave the lulav on that day, even on Shabbat. In other cases, the mitzvah of lulav would be done for only six days. And again, this was only when the Temple was standing. Today, people never wave the lulav on Shabbat.<p></p><p>In addition to the lulav, which is waved by every Israelite, there was a separate willow branch (aravah) that only the priests were required to take. With this aravah in their hands, they would circle the Altar. This aravah is special in that it is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah. There were always schools that taught that whatever is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah but is taught from teacher to student is not true. To emphasize that the aravah was true, it was allowed even on Shabbat, when this Shabbat coincided with the last day of Sukkot.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Pollard Willows and Setting Sun by&nbsp;Vincent van Gogh</p>

They would also blow trumpets as a sign of joy.&nbsp;</p><p>On the first six days of the Holiday, they would circle the Altar once and say, "Please, God, save us! Please, God, bring us success!"

The source for this is the phrase, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=16#P5352" target="_blank">And you will be only happy.</a>" There is a rule that the word "only" comes to emphasize something at the expense of the other. What is it? - The eighth night of the festival is included in the joy of the previous seven days.<p></p><p>A certain heretic whose name was Sasson (rejoicing) said to Rabbi Abahu, "In the future, the Jewish nation will be drawing water for me." He quoted the phrase from Isaiah, "<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15943/jewish/Chapter-12.htm" target="_blank">You will draw water with rejoicing (Sasson)</a>."</p><p>Rabbi Abahu answers, "If it said, for Sasson, you may be right. But since it says with Sasson, the skin of that person (you) will be made into a flask and be used for water drawing."</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Still Life with Four Stone Bottles, Flask and White Cup by Van Gogh</p>

There was a golden vessel with a capacity of three lugin (between half a liter to a liter), which they filled from a freshwater spring outside of the Old City of Jerusalem. They would blow the trumpets and pour the wine into its bowl and the water into its bowl. The water bowl had a thinner spout so that both water and wine would pour out in the same amount of time.<p></p><p>The bowls were situated at the left corner of the Altar going up, and the wine was poured from there into the deep ducts. The priest would go down into the ducts once in seventy years, bring up the congealed wine, and burn it. Others say that the ducts were there from the beginning of creation, and no cleaning was needed. The hint to this is in the Song of Song, "<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3007.htm" target="_blank">Your concealed thighs are the work of a master craftsman</a>." From here, Talmud learns that Torah study and good deeds are to be done in private.</p><p>The water used for libation cannot stay overnight and cannot be left uncovered. In general, <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/01/shabbat-110-water-left-uncovered.html" target="_blank">uncovered water should not be used because snakes may drink from it</a>. Here, even using a filter would not help because of the idea that if you <a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2401.htm" target="_blank">would not present something to a ruler</a>, you would, of course, not do it for God.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Art of Painting (detail) by&nbsp;Johannes Vermeer</p><p><br /></p>

However, the Talmud also derives this from the dimensions of the Temple. Since the height of the Ark was ten handbreadths, and since <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=25#P2215">God spoke to Moses from the top of the Ark</a>, while Moses listened from below, we see that the two domains never come closer than ten handbreadths. Therefore, this is the minimal size of the partition, and it applies to sukkah as well. 
<br />
<br />
Others derive it from the angels on top of the Ark, called Cherubim. Since the sukkah's roof is called “s'chach,” which means shelter or cover, and since the Cherubim are said to <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=25#P2213">shelter (“sochechim”) the Ark with their wings</a>, we see that they literally define the word s'chach, which must be at the same height as their wings.

It served as a musical accompaniment before the drawing of the water for libation. Since it was not played on Shabbat or Festivals, sometimes it worked out to five days of flute playing and sometimes six.<div><br /></div><div>But why was it not played on Shabbat? Indeed, there is an opinion that it was played on Shabbat. It all depends on whether the instrumental part is essential - and then flute music qualifies as Temple service, which should be done on Shabbat. Or whether the vocal part is essential - and then the flute is not played on Shabbat.</div><div><br /></div><div>If we believe that the essence of the Temple musical service is instrumental, we can derive other laws from it. For example, the flute used in Moses' times was made of wood (based on the assumption that the wooden flute has the sweetest sound).&nbsp; From here, it follows that all service vessels, such as the menorah, can be made of wood. Others would argue that the flute of Moses had to be made of wood and could not be made of metal. They say that you cannot take a situation where you are forced to do something and derive that you have to do it in other situations. Which logic is more correct? It is one of the unresolved questions in the Talmud.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Boy playing the Flute by Judith Leyster</div>

Sukkah 56 – A good neighbor

After a week of staying on the table, it was divided between the priests serving in the Temple – between the two groups serving that week, incoming and outgoing. 
<br />
<br />
However, on the three holidays: Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot, all priests were permitted to serve in the Temple, not just the two groups, and then the bread of vision was divided equally. Even when a Holiday does not actually occur on Shabbat but is adjacent to it, the bread was still divided equally – since all the priests who came for the holidays were still there on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
The northern part of the Temple courtyard was more special since many services were performed there. The incoming priests were dividing and eating the Bread of Vision there to symbolize that they were dedicating themselves to the services for the coming week; those outgoing ate the bread in the south, where no services were usually performed. However, the family of Bilga always divided their bread in the south. Why?
<br />
<br />
One of the daughters in this family married a Greek general, and when the Greeks entered the Temple, she was beating the Altar with her shoe, saying, “Wolf! Wolf! You are consuming Jewish money, yet you don't protect them in hard times.” The Sages punished her family. But why the whole family? – She must have heard it from the family. 
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, there is a rule: woe to the bad person and woe to his neighbor. On the bright side, there is also a rule: “Blessing to a good man, and blessing to his neighbor.” The Talmud finds a phrase in Isaiah to support this.

Throughout the Talmud, we have multiple instances of specific limits; for example, sukkah must not be lower than ten handbreadths. Where are these limits coming from? – Most were taught to Moses by God on Mount Sinai and then passed through generations. This in contradistinction to laws that are written down in the Torah itself.
<br />
<br />
But even for other limits - they are all written in the Torah! - in the phrase which seems to be praising the Land of Israel, but which really serves as the enumeration of limits. Here it is: “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=8#P5140">It is a land of wheat, barley, grapes, figs, and pomegranates - a land of oil-olives and honey-dates</a>.”<br />
<br />
For example, wheat is used for measuring ritual impurity: if one stays in a house afflicted with the special type of leprosy for longer than it takes to eat half a loaf of wheat bread, his garments become impure.  So too barley: a human bone the size of a barley seed makes one ritually impure. Fig – this is how much food one needs to carry on Shabbat to be liable, and so on.
<br />
<br />
So what is the origin of all the prescribed limits and measures? – Didn't we say that measures are specifically mentioned in the Torah phrase above? - No, of course not! It just talks about Israel's bounty, and the measures were given by God orally, made dependent on fruit sizes rather than absolute numbers, and are only hinted at in the Torah.<br />

The third wall can be as small as one handbreadth. How do we know this? The words “sukkot” - meaning multiple sukkahs, are mentioned three times in the Torah. In two cases, the letter “o” (vav) is missing! This gives us a count of sukkahs (2), plus sukkah (1), plus another sukkah (1), a total of four. However, the first mention is needed for the simple meaning of the word – to live in a sukkah. Thus, we have a hint that a sukkah needs to have only three walls. In addition, we have another rule that God taught to Moses – that the third wall can be as narrow as a handbreadth. 
<br />
<br />
All this assumes that we take the written text of the Torah as definitive. There is another point of view, however. In it, that the definitive is how the words are pronounced in the synagogues when the Torah is read. The word is always pronounced “sukkot” - that is, plural. The first three mentions are needed for their simple meaning, but the remaining two extra words – each pronounced as “sukkot” (2) give us four walls. The last fourth wall can be only a handbreadth.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud gives three more possible explanations for the argument whether sukkah needs to have three or four walls – in one all believe in the writing, in another – all believe in the pronunciation, and in the third – it does not depend on this distinction at all.

How much? The roof, called "s'chach," should be thick enough to block out more than half the sun. What if the makeshift walls don't go all the way to the roof and therefore let in the sun? - That does not matter. However, Rabbi Yoshiyah says that just as in a normal house, the walls protect and shade you, so they must not let too much sun in the sukkah.
<br />
<br />
We see that Rabbi Yoshiyah requires some permanence in the construction of a sukkah. Other Sages also require permanence, as evidenced by their words in other areas. For example, Rabbi Yehudah validates a high sukkah, which would mean that its walls are sturdy and somewhat permanent; Rabbi Shimon requires four walls, and not just three; Rabban Gamliel does not allow a sukkah on a wagon or a car.
<br />
<br />
Can a sukkah be round? - No, because normal houses are not built like that. However, Rabbi Yochanan allows a round sukkah if it was large enough for twenty-four people to sit – since people do throw parties in this manner. The Talmud goes through multiple calculations to explain the twenty-four count.

Sukkah 9 – Old sukkah

The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=23#P3434">Sukkot is a festival to God for seven days</a>.” That is, the sukkah must be built expressly for the festival – so says The School of Shammai. However,&nbsp; Hillel's school rules that an old sukkah is completely valid. One should make a little adjustment to a small area of the roof (s'chach), which is sufficient. But what does Beit Hillel do with the phrase “festival for seven days”? – They say that it teaches one not to use the materials of the sukkah for any other purpose, for all seven days of the festival.
<br />
<br />
If one builds his sukkah under a tree, it is as if he built it inside the house, and it is invalid. In explaining this, Rava said, "If the tree foliage is thin and lets in more sun than it shades, it is valid." How does Rava know that, given that the rule did not differentiate between thick and thin foliage!? He noticed the precise language of the ruling, “as if inside the house.” Just as a house usually shields one from the sun completely, so here we are talking about trees that shield completely, and not those with sparse foliage. And yet, the leaves of the tree do give shade, and the sukkah leaves are not needed directly underneath, so let's consider them non-existent. Thus we have a sukkah whose s'chach (a tree) is attached to the ground, and that is definitely invalid! Rava will answer, “He bent the tree's branches down and intertwined them with his s'chach; therefore, they are not above but act in conjunction with the s'chach, which is then valid.<br />

Taanit 11 – The fasts of special individuals

They fast only since morning till evening, and they are allowed to bathe and to work. If at the beginning of Kislev, about two weeks later, there are still no rains, the Court decrees three fasts, now already for the community. 
<br />
<br />
Who are those unique individuals? – These are the Sages, but for this purpose, anybody can deem himself a Sage since it only brings suffering for him, and not any honor. Furthermore, if one fasts expecting that his fasting will remove particular trouble, and the crisis indeed goes away, he still needs to complete his fast. One should not separate himself from the community in bad times, hoping that it will be good for him individually, but instead, suffer together with all – and then he will be privileged to see the deliverance.
<br />
<br />
In general, should one fast? Shmuel said he is called a “sinner,” but Rabbi Elazar said he is called “Holy.” Both base their opinion on the Nazirite, and there is no contradiction: it depends on the intention of the person and on whether he can study while fasting.

Taanit 12 – Fasting for part of a day

Rav Chisda said that it is impossible: it is not considered a fast if he ate before the end of the day. Then what is the concept of a partial fast? Rav Chisda will answer one who was too busy to eat in the first part of the day, and then decided to accept the fast until the end of the day: such a fast is valid, and he is even allowed to say the special prayer "Answer us!" for the fast days.<br />
<br />
But how about the laypeople accompanying the kohanim in bringing the sacrifices – they were fasting but not completing the fast, and nevertheless, it is called a fast? – Ravi Chisda answers, "They did it just to afflict themselves, but it is not an official fast." So then what about Rabbi Yochanan, who used to declare, "I am in a fast until I come home." – He was only doing this to avoid the social obligation of a meal at the house of the ruling prince. And yet, some say that there is a concept of partial fast having spiritual significance.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yehoshua visited the home of Rav Idi, and they made a special meal for him, a calf one-third grown. He said, "I can't eat; I am fasting." They told him, "Do this: cancel this fast and repay it later!" He answered, "My fast has a reason: I saw a bad dream. In that case, you cannot change the day since the fast must be on the day of the dream." That is true even on Shabbat, except that on Shabbat, one should not fast – so what does one do? Fast now, and then fast again on a weekday, to atone for his fasting on Shabbat.

People stop eating before sunset; all other restrictions are similar to Yom Kippur or Tisha B'Av, and even work is not allowed. If these fasts pass and still there is no rain, the Court decrees another seven fasts. On these last fasts, even stores are closed.
<br />
<br />
More than thirteen fasts for rain are not decreed on the congregation. Instead, construction and planting of joyous nature are forbidden; people reduce engagements, marriages, do not greet each other, and behave like people censured by God. After this, exceptional individuals continue fasting until the spring month of Nissan, since after that, the rain, even if it falls, is no longer a sign of blessing.
<br />
<br />
Why did the Sages prohibit work on these fast days? Granted, all other prohibitions are against enjoyment, but work is no pleasure!? They are similar to Holidays – both are called "a gathering," and just as work is prohibited on the Holidays, it must be prohibited on these stringent fast days.

Otherwise, his public spectacle will make him an object of ridicule, and people will doubt his inner worth.<br />
<br />
Similarly, one should not put on sackcloth, like King Ahab did. In his case, he was answered. <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b06.htm" target="_blank">Here is the story</a>: a woman was crying, asking for help from the King. He asked her what the matter was. She told him that she agreed with her friend to boil and eat her son, and then the friend's son the next day, but now the friend hid her son. When the King heard that, he was so overwhelmed with the realization of how bad the famine was that he put on sackcloth and started to pray and, even though he was not righteous, his prayer was answered in one day – flour became plentiful and cheap.
<br />
<br />
How did they conduct the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/06/taanit-13-series-of-fasts.html" target="_blank">seven most strict fasts</a>? They brought the Torah into the town square. They put ashes upon the Ark, upon the head of the leading ruler, and the heads of the Court members. Then everyone else put ashes on his own head. A Sage among them tried to captivate their hearts, starting with "Brothers, remember the people of Nineveh: God looked not at their sackcloth and fast but at their good deeds and stopping to do evil."
<br />
<br />
They added six special blessings to the regular eighteen, and thus the prayer leader says the twenty-four blessings in his prayer. The extra ones deal with redemption, remembrance, and answering prayer.

Why would they do this? – To show that "We prayed in private, and it did not help. Now we humiliate ourselves in public." Others say that it is to exile ourselves since an exile expiates the person's wrong deeds. What is the practical difference between the two explanations? According to the second one, we would be able to "exile" ourselves to another synagogue, but only a public place would suffice, according to the first one.
<br />
<br />
On fast days, people visited cemeteries to show that "We are considered like dead before God." Others say that it is to influence the dead so that they should pray on our behalf. What is the practical difference between these two explanations? According to the first one, any cemetery will do, but one needs to go specifically to a Jewish cemetery according to the second one.
<br />
<br />
A prototypical fast is the one people did in <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1701.htm">Nineveh, in the days of Jonah</a> –  except that they had different arguments. For example, they tied animal mothers and offspring separately and proclaimed, "If You, God, do not have mercy on us, we will not have mercy on them." They also argued, "The righteous usually yield before the wicked. You, God, are righteous, and we are wicked, so You should yield before us and pity us." But they also did good deeds: for example, if one of them stole a beam and built a palace for himself, he would now repay the money and dismantle his palace to return the stolen goods.

Since the Temple can be rebuilt any day, it follows that a Kohen who knows the day when he would be officiating in the Temple should not drink wine on that day. He should also not drink wine the week that he knows would be his week to serve. And since no Kohen today knows his lineage and Temple schedule, no Kohen should ever drink wine.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that although it is true, but what can he say – since their ruin (not being able to serve in the Temple) is also their defence: it has been many years that the Temple has not been rebuilt, and they can now drink wine any time. 
<br />
<br />
But, by the same token, they should also cut their hair at least every thirty days! Why? – Because drinking wine and growing long hair are prohibited in the exact same phrase. – No, that logic is wrong! If the Temple is rebuilt, and we are looking for a sober Kohen to serve there and can find none - then indeed we are in trouble. But a long-haired Kohen can quickly take a haircut and go officiate.

First, the Talmud deals with the details of these prohibitions and then describes the miracles.
<br />
<br />
The daily sacrifice in the Temple has to be brought from communal funds, but the school of Sadducees argued that it should be brought by an individual. The argument lasted for eight days, from the first of Nissan, and the Sages convinced their opponents. This was considered a miracle.
<br />
<br />
The school of Baitus about the date of Shavuot: they understood the word “Shabbat” as Saturday, but the Sages had the tradition that&nbsp;in this context, it means a Holiday of Passover. Again, the Sages convinced them, and this miracle was celebrated for all the days when the argument occurred.<br />
<br />
A Greek governor Nikanor would wave every day toward the Temple, saying, “When will it fall into my hands, and I will trample it?” When the Maccabees prevailed, they cut off his thumbs and big toes and hung them at the gates of Jerusalem, saying, “The mouth that said it, the hands that waved and the feet that would trample – let revenge be taken against them.” Incidentally, they cut off his head, too.
<br />
<br />
Turianus accused the Jews of murdering his daughter. Two men, Lullianus and Papus, stepped up and falsely admitted the crime. Before  Turianus executed them, he said, “You are from the people of Chananya, Mishael, and Azarya; let a miracle happen to you!” They answered, “They were perfectly righteous, but we are not, and Nebuchadnezzar was a proper king, but you are a commoner. However, God chose you to execute us so that He can then take revenge against you.”  Turianus nevertheless killed them right away, and at that very moment, messengers arrived from Rome to execute him in turn. This happened on the twelfth of Adar.
<br />
<br />
Later all these minor holidays were abolished because of subsequent sad events that occurred on these days.

If the crops grew abnormally and may be totally ruined, if the rains fell irregularly (too strong or too weak), or any other natural or economic condition which may result in a dangerous food shortage. 
<br />
<br />
Once all Israel collected in Jerusalem for a Festival, but, due to a drought, there was not enough water for them to drink. Then Nakdimon ben Gurion, a very wealthy Jew, went to a Roman patrician to borrow twelve wells of water. He promised to return the water by way of rains, and if not – to pay twelve talents of silver (equal to about seven million dollars). The promised day has come, but there was no rain. Thrice did the patrician send for his money, but Nakdimon argued that he still had until the end of the day. Then the patrician went to the baths, preparing to celebrate, while Nakdimon went to the Temple to pray. He said, “You know, God, that I did not do it for my own – or my family's – glory,” and the rains poured. And yet, the patrician claimed that the rain came after the sun was down. So Nakdimon went back to the Temple to pray, and the sun has shown through the clouds. 
<br />
<br />
In general, the sun stood still for three people: Moses, Joshua, and Nakdimon.

Taanit 2 – Three keys

When should one say these? Rabbi Eliezer says that one should mention rain from the beginning of Sukkot, which marks the beginning of the rainy season. Rabbi Yehoshua asked, “A rain is bad on Sukkot, because one is trying to live in a sukkah!?” Rather, one should begin to pray for rain on the last day of Sukkot. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer answered, "I also did not mean to pray for rain on Sukkot, just to mention God's power to give it." Rabbi Yehoshua asked, "Then mention it all year!" Rabbi Eliezer replied, "Actually, yes, you can." Good answer! And Rabbi Yehoshua? He replied, "I understand why we mention the Resurrection of the Dead because any day is good for that. On the other hand, rains are bad at harvest time and so should not be mentioned."
<br />
<br />
Why does the teacher start this subject at all?! – Since we just learned about <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/10/rosh-hashanah-16.html" target="_blank">Rosh Hashanah</a>, where it is discussed when the world is judged regarding water and rain, it is now appropriate to discuss when to pray for it. But how do we know we should pray for rain? – Because of the phrase, "You will serve God with your heart... and He will give you rain." What is the service with the heart? – that is prayer.
<br />
<br />
Why does the teacher mention specifically the "power" of God to give rain? – because, as Rabbi Yochanan said, it is related to one of the three keys that God does not give to another: rain, conception, and the revival of the dead.

Taanit 20 – Better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar

In analyzing <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1504.htm">this phrase from Amos</a>, Rav Yehudah said – it is a bad sign for both.
<br />
<br />
However, on other occasions, Rav Yehudah found good signs within bad ones. For example, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm">Jerusalem will be like a widow</a>.” – but not really a widow, rather, like a woman whose husband went overseas but plans to come back. Another case: prophet Achiya cursed Israel that God would smite it like a reed. And yet, reeds straighten out after a storm. On the other hand, Bilam blessed them to be like a tall cedar that withstands a strong wind. A strong wind – yes, but not a hurricane when cedar becomes uprooted. Thus, it is better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar. Moreover, the reed merited that a pen is made from it.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, was going home from his yeshiva on a donkey, and he was happy about the Torah that he had learned. A hideous man greeted him, but he replied, “How ugly is that man!” The man said, “Go back to the craftsman who made me and complain to him.” Rabbi Elazar immediately got down from the donkey and started begging forgiveness, but the man was adamant. Only when the people of the town to which they were going interceded did the man grant forgiveness. Rabbi Elazar directed to the study hall, and his first lesson was, “A person should be pliable as a reed and not hard as a cedar.”

Once the Jews needed to send a gift of precious pearls to the Roman emperor. They chose  Nachum ish Gam Zu because "he is used to miracles happen on his behalf." On the road, people at an inn exchanged the precious stones in his chest for dirt from the house. In the morning, when Nachum saw it, he said, "This, too, is for the best," and continued on his way to present it to the emperor. When the latter saw the dirt, he was enraged, "Jew are mocking me!" and decided to kill them all. Nachum said, "That, too, is for the best."
<br />
<br />
Elijah the prophet appeared, looking like one of the court nobles, and suggested, "Perhaps this are magical dirt, which Abraham used to conquer his enemies." They tested the dirt in a far-away war, and the dirt turned into swords, the straw in it – into arrows, and they have successfully concluded the war. Upon return, they filled Nachum's chest with treasures as a sign of gratitude.
<br />
<br />
When Nachum returned to the same inn, the people saw the honor awarded him and asked him why. He told them the story. They razed the house, took the dirt from it, and presented it to the emperor, saying, "Nachum's dirt is from the same house." However, their dirt did not test as well as Nachum's, and they were executed.<br />

Taanit 22 – Military mistake of Yoshiyahu

Rabbi Beroka once asked Elijah the Prophet, “Who in this marketplace deserves to be in the World to Come right now?” Elijah pointed out a Jewish man who was wearing non-Jewish clothes. Rabbi Beroka asked him what he did, and the man told him to come tomorrow. On the next day, the man said that he was a prison guard and kept particular watch over Jewish female prisoners so that they would not be violated. He would also inform the Sages of any evil designs he heard about, and the Sages prayed and annulled them. The previous day, he was rushing on just such a mission.
<br />
<br />
Then Elijah pointed out another two people. They were jesters, and when they saw anybody looking depressed, they would not let him go until he laughed and felt better. They would similarly make peace in cases of feuds.
<br />
<br />
Courts would proclaim a fast when a military force passed through even without the intent of making war on Israel -&nbsp; because of a high potential of confrontation.  Here is a related story. Pharaoh Necho passed through Israel, and king Yoshiyahu decided to confront him. His logic was based on this phrase in the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=26#P3528">A sword will not pass through your land</a>,” and besides, Necho was trusting in his idol. Nevertheless, Yoshiyahu died in battle.  Why was the righteous Yoshuyahu punished? – Because he did not consult Jeremiah, and thus did not know that his generation was not worthy of Divine protection and that the phrase did not apply.

Once the rains were very late in coming, and people asked Choni to pray for rain. He told them to hide away their clay ovens intended for the coming Passover sacrifice - for they would melt -&nbsp; prayed for rain, but it did not come. Choni then drew a circle and swore that he would not leave it until his prayer was answered. A slight drizzle started to trickle. "This is not what I asked for," - said Choni - "but a powerful rain!" Immediately it started raining with force, and each drop was like a bucket. "That is not what I asked," - said Choni - "but a normal beneficial rain." A medium rain started to fall - but it would not stop! People collected on the Temple Mount because of the water and asked Choni to pray to stop the rain. He replied, "It is not proper to ask God to stop a blessing, even if it is too much of it."<div>Nevertheless, he said, "Bring me a bull for a sacrifice." He took the bull, put his two hands on its head, and said, "Master of the world, your children cannot stand too much bad or too much good." The wind blew, the sun showed, and the rain stopped.<br />
<br />
All his life Choni was bothered by the phrase, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26c6.htm">When we came back from Babylon to rebuild the Temple, we were like dreamers</a>." This exile lasted for seventy years, but can anyone sleep for that long? Once Choni saw a man planting carob trees. The man told him that he was producing for his grandchildren, just as his grandfathers planted for him, for it takes seventy years for a carob to grow. Choni then sat down to eat and fell asleep. When he awoke, he saw a man by the carob tree who told Choni that he was a grandson of the man he had seen earlier. Choni deduced that he had slept for seventy years. He went to the study hall, where he heard the students say, "Today all is clear to us, just like in the days of Choni, the circle maker." He said, "I am Choni." But they did not believe him and did not pay him proper respect. He prayed for mercy and died.<br />

Rabbi Mani was a student of Rabbi Yitzhak ben Eliyashiv. Once Rabbi Mani complained that his wife's family members were wealthy, haughty, and mistreated him. "Let them become poor," said Rabbi Yitzhak, and they became poor. Rabbi Mani complained that they were forcing him to work, and Rabbi Yitzchak said, "Let them become rich again," and they become wealthy. Rabbi Mani also mentioned that his wife was homely. "What is her name?" asked Rabbi Yitchak. - "Channa." "Let Channa become beautiful," - said Rabbi Yitzhak. And she became beautiful. But now, she became haughty and ruled over Rabbi Mani, so Rabbi Yitzhak said, "Let Channa return to her homeliness." Later, students of Rabbi Yitzhak asked to pray so that they would become extra bright. He answered, "I don't do such things any longer."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose from Yukrat has a son who supervised his workers. Once Rabbi Yose was late with the worker's food, the son said, "O fig tree, bring forth your fruit for the workers to eat." When Rabbi Yose arrived, he apologized for being late since he was busy with a mitzvah. They said, "No need to worry." They told him what happened, and he said to his son, "You caused the tree to bring fruit before its time; may it be that you will pass before your time." He also had a gorgeous daughter. Once he saw a man making a hole in a wall to see his daughter. He asked what the man was doing. The man replied that he did not merit to marry her, but at least was it forbidden to look? Rabbi Yose said to his daughter, "Since you are the cause of the people stumbling, may you return to dust." Rabbi Yose's student deduced from here, "If he does not have pity on his son and daughter, I am in danger!" - and left.<br />

Rava decreed a fast, but the rain did not come. They told him, "When Rav Yehudah fasted, rain would always come." Rava agreed. He said, "When he took off one shoe, it already rained." What is this story? Rav Yehudah once saw people throwing bread. He said, "Better there should be a famine," and so it was. The Sages asked his assistant, Rav Kahana, to take him into the market. Rav Yehudah saw a long line and asked, "What is this?" Rav Kahana told him, "People line up for flour from date pits." Rav Yehudah said, "It must be that a famine came; we need to proclaim a fast." On strict fasts, wearing leather shoes is prohibited, and Rav Yehudah asked his assistant to remove his shoes. As soon as the first one was off, the rain came. Elijah, the prophet, rushed to say, "Do not take off another shoe, or else God will destroy the world." But often, owing to the extreme shame and humiliation of the Sages who could not bring the rain, the rain would indeed come.<br />

His wife was embarrassed by their poverty and would put smoking wood into her empty oven on Friday. Once, her neighbor decided to check what she was baking – since she knew that they had nothing&nbsp;–&nbsp;and knocked&nbsp;on the door. R. Chanina's wife hid inside. However, the neighbor saw an oven full of bread and called – "Your bread is being burned, bring a shovel!" R' Chanina's wife replied that she went for the shovel herself. This was actually true since she was used to miracles.<br />
<br />
Another time, however, she said life was too hard and asked Rabbi Chanina to pray.  A golden hand appeared and gave him one leg of a golden table. However, Rabbi Chanina was shown a dream wherein the World to Come all were eating at a three-legged table, but the table of his wife and him only had two. She asked him to pray again, and the leg was taken back. 
<br />
<br />
Once, R' Chanina's daughter was sad: she put vinegar instead of oil into the Shabbat lamp. However, R' Chanina commented: the One who made the oil burn can command the vinegar to burn, and so it was: vinegar lamp burned till the end of Shabbat.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chanina had some goats, and the neighbors claimed that they were ruining their fields. Rabbi Chanina said, "If they do – they should be eaten by bears, but if not – each should bring a bear on her horns," Indeed, each goat brought a bear on its horns.

People felt tremendous, but Shmuel said it was similar to a master who said, "Give them whatever they ask, but let me not hear their voices." Another time, rain fell after the end of the fast. People felt good, but Shmuel told them it was similar to a master who said, "Wait till my servant is humbled enough and only then give him what he needs." If so, when should the rain start to be considered good, according to Shmuel? He answered, "When the prayer leader says, "Who makes the wind blow"&nbsp; - and the wind blows. Then, the prayer leader says, "Who makes the rain fall," and the rain falls.</p><p>The Talmud enumerates the rules of communal worship, days of fasting, and days of feasting. When the Temple was in existence, groups of priests served on appointed weeks. Community representatives were also there, in the Temple or their cities, as if standing by their offerings. These were called "maamadot" or "standing." The saddest day of the Jewish calendar is Tisha B'Av, and the most joyful days are Tu B'Av and Yom Kippur.

Can people go about their business as if nothing is happening? For that reason, the appointed members of the congregation were doing "maamadot" or "standing by" - as community representatives.<p></p><p>Now, the whole procedure was as follows. When the appointed week for each priest group would come, they would go to the Temple. However, half of them went to the labor market in Jericho to do agricultural work, which was plentiful and provided sustenance for the priests who served in the Temple. Some say that they would change after three days so that everybody would get a chance for Temple service. There were twenty-four groups of priests in total, and thus they would serve in the Temple two weeks a year on average.</p><p>The community representative would be standing by, saying prayers, reading from the Torah, and fasting. Some were in Jerusalem, but some remained in their cities, collecting themselves in the synagogue. Each group was essential, and the sacrifices could not be brought if it was missing.</p><p>The Temple service was what assured the existence of Heaven and the Earth. What is the source for this? In the phrase, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=15#P369" target="_blank">Whereby shall I know that I will inherit Israel</a>?" The complete conversation went like this. Abraham said, "Master of the Universe! All is well now, but if Jews sin, will you destroy them?" God said, "No." Abraham continued, "How do I know?" God said, "Take three calves and three goats, etc." This means that the merit of the sacrifices will atone."&nbsp;</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Weaning the Calves by Rosa Bonheur</p>

Rabbi Yehudah adds a human aspect to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/06/taanit-2-three-keys.html">the previous discussion</a>. Even though by right we should start mentioning the rain on the last day of Sukkot – when the rainy season begins and when the people can safely travel home, even in the presence of rain – we should also avoid confusion. If we start in the evening – many people may miss the evening prayer and not be aware of the addition. And if we say it in the morning, they might mistakenly think that the prayer for rain started already yesterday evening and will therefore make a mistake next year. So, the prayer leader should not mention rain in the morning prayer for everybody to know what's right. Then, he should attract their attention by saying it in the additional morning prayer (Mussaf), and then everybody will know.
<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, if one mentions that God gives dew and winds, he can do it any time he wants – because these never stop. And how do we know this about winds? – From the phrase "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2302.htm" target="_blank">Just as the four directions (winds) of the world – so I have spread Israel, says God</a>." This means that just as the world cannot be without winds, so it cannot be without Israel, which is spread out in the world to sustain it.

Taanit 4 – Three improper requests

Since we spoke about <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/06/taanit-3-four-corners-of-world.html">rain and seeds</a>, Rava said a related thing: "Young Sages are like a seed under a clod of the earth: he hides and grows, but when he is out, his power only increases." He also said, "When a Sage gets angry, it is the Torah that is burning in him, since God says, '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1123.htm">Is not My word like fire?</a>'" In addition, the Sage must be hard as iron. The Talmud gives two proofs for that. And yet, a person must train himself to always remain calm and "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3111.htm">remove anger from his  heart.</a>"<br />
<br />
Three have asked God incorrectly, but in two cases, that got a proper reply. The first one was Eliezer, who prayed, "The girl that comes out first will be Isaac's wife." This could include someone with a bodily defect or unfit, but he was answered by Rebecca coming to the well. The second one was Saul, who promised to "make rich and marry his daughter" to a person who would fight Goliath. This could have been a slave or a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/12/kiddushin-67-offspring.html">mamzer</a>, marriage with whom would be forbidden. But he was answered with David stepping up to the task.<br />
<br />
The last was Yiftach (Jephthah), who said that if he wins against the enemies, he will sacrifice the first thing that comes out of his house. One might think it includes even a pig or other non-kosher animal, which cannot be offered. Instead, his daughter came out to greet him. Some say she took a vow of celibate life, and others – that he actually sacrificed her. This was uncalled for since his vow was not even valid, and he should have asked the Sage Pinchas to annul it.

Some say, until the very end of the month when Passover occurs, that is, Nissan – just as it happened once when "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1402.htm">God made rainfall, early and late, in Nissan</a>."<br />
<br />
But we learned that the proper time for the early rain is a few months before, in Marcheshvan!? – this event happened only once, in the time of Joel, after the seven-year drought. People asked Joel, should they plant the small amount of seed they had – and die before the crop sprouts? He told them to plant nevertheless. A miracle happened to them, and new wheat grew in just eleven days so that they could bring the Omer sacrifice – and start eating the grain right away. This is what the phrase "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26c6.htm">Those who sow with tears will reap with joy</a>" means. In fact, as an ox drew the plow going one way and sowing, the grain already began to grow, so it could already eat the new growth on the way back. The ears of grain were then two times longer than the stalk.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yitzchak was sitting at a meal with Rav Nachman, and Rav Nachman asked him to say something, but Rav Yitchak replied, "One should not talk during a meal, so as not to choke." After the meal, he said, "Jacob never died." Rav Nachman jumped in surprise, "But they embalmed and buried him!"  Rav Yitzhak replied, "I am just interpreting the phrase, '<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1130.htm">I will redeem Israel and Jacob</a>.' Just as Israel must be alive to be redeemed, so too Jacob."
<br />
<br />
When they were parting, Rav Nachman asked Rav Yitzchak to bless him. The latter replied, "Imagine someone in a desert who finds a tree with a well. After he is refreshed, he says to the tree, 'How can I bless you? You have everything. May your saplings be like you.' You, too, you have Torah, and riches, and children. Therefore, I wish that they all may be like you."

Then the rains come and water them, and the growth shows in the spring.<div><br /></div><div>There are many different opinions as to the days when these rains are expected to fall. But what practical significance does it have?</div><div>
<br />For the early rainfall, the answer is clear: it falls at the beginning of the rain season, and we need to know when to start praying so that this rain should indeed come. For the last one, it is also apparent: if no rain fell by then, unique pious individuals would begin to fast.<br />
<br />
The question is about the middle one: why do we need to know when to expect it? It turns out that the knowledge of this date is also essential in many places of the law. For example, for vows: if one vows not to eat a particular fruit until the rains come, it is presumed that he meant the middle ones. It also matters for gleanings. Usually, gleanings are reserved exclusively for the poor. However, when even the poor abandon and no longer collect them, anyone can take them. When the last, slow and meticulous poor go through the fields, nobody else hopes to find a significant amount of gleanings. Then the legal owners of them - the impoverished - despair of finding any more and give them up. This gives the grains the legal status of ownerless and thus available to anybody. What is the date for that? - The time of the second rain.</div><div>
<br />
When one sees the rain after a period of drought, he should say, "Blessed is God for every drop of rain." In Israel, where showers are scarce, one actually says this when he sees the first rain in the rainy winter season.

Temurah 10 – Sacrificial Exchange of Limbs

Neither can one consecrate unconsecrated fetuses for limbs.
<br />
<br />
One cannot substitute unconsecrated fetuses or limbs for the whole peace offerings, nor unconsecrated whole animals for fetuses or limbs. Here Rabbi Yose disagrees and says that one can substitute limbs for sacrifices, and here is why: if one consecrates a limb of an animal to be a sacrifice, then the consecrations spreads throughout the animal and the complete animal becomes sacrifice, and our exchange is the same. What about the first teacher, why doesn't he agree to this? – While he may agree to the principle that the sanctification of a leg of a primary sacrifice spreads throughout its whole body, he does not agree that this also applies in the case of exchange.

Temurah 11 – Sanctifying A Fetus Of An Animal

But can a fetus be sanctified as a sacrifice? Bar Padda holds that it cannot, and Rabbi Yochanan says that it can. They asked Bar Padda about multiple rules of sanctifying a fetus, and he answered that all these rules dealt with sanctifying the value of the fetus, donating money to the needs of the Temple, but not the animal itself. Finally, they challenged him from our previous ruling about&nbsp;substituting&nbsp;a fetus which was a sacrifice. In this case he answered that we are dealing with their mother who already was a sacrifice, thus the offspring became sacrifice automatically.
<br />
<br />
What happens when one sanctifies a limb of a live animal as a sacrifice? If this limb is so important that the animal could not survive without it, all agree that the sanctification spreads throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;the body of the animal. If the animal can survive, some say that the sanctification still spreads, while others say that it doesn't. They asked about a leg of a bird, is it the same? On the one hand, a bird is not an animal, so the law may be different, but on the other hand, it is also a sacrifice? – and did not find an answer.<br />

Temurah 12 – When Calculations Determine The Law

However, if the amount of the kohen's portion grain was less than 1% of the regular grain, the terumah is nullified, and the complete mixture is permitted. What happens when the terumah was not nullified, and some of the mixture fell into another pile of grain? We calculate the percentage of the initial terumah portion in comparison to the total, and this gives us a leniency. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees. According to the him, the complete forbidden mixture acquires the status of terumah, with the full power to prohibit the grain it falls into.
<br />
<br />
Tangentially, when one prepares waters mixed with the ashes of a red heifer, to purify people and vessels after contact with a dead body, one has to put the ashes on the water, not the other way around. Rabbi Shimon says that either order is acceptable, because the Torah compares it to water with earth used to remove suspicion of adultery. Just as there any order is acceptable, so too here. And the first teacher? He says that the last words in the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=19#P4304">put ashes on the water</a>” determine the order: the ash is what makes the water purifying, and we find the same rule in many other places.

Temurah 13 – No Exchanges For Birds And Flour

The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3578">If one does substitute an animal</a>...” – only animals are included in this law, but not birds, and not flour.
<br />
<br />
Likewise, the community and partners cannot make an exchange with their offering, since the Torah stated, “He shall not exchange.” This tells us that only “he” is included in this law, not community or partners. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that the derivation is different: animal tithe was included in the laws of exchange, together with all other 
animals. When the Torah then repeated this, it is teaching us something new, namely, the exception that “improves” the rule, that is, teaches something about it. Just as tithe can only separated by an individual, so too exchange can only done by an individual. Parenthetically, just as tithe is an Altar offering, so should be animals subject to exchange – which excludes offerings made for Temple maintenance.

On the other hand, communal offerings can be brought on Shabbat, and even in the state of impurity, but personal offerings cannot.
<br />
<br />
Rav Dimi had a clarification for these rules, concerning libations. He said, "If I had someone to carry a letter go Babylon, I would write and send this clarification to them." But would he send it? The Torah said that “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2521">Write these words</a>...” &nbsp;refers to the written Torah scroll, but “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2521">Through  these words</a>” refers to all other laws that one is not permitted to write down! – A new law is different, for it is better to violate the Torah prohibition of writing than risk whole Torah being forgotten.
<br />
<br />
But how can the Talmud even ask such a question, when we know that Rabbi Yehudah the Prince collected and published the Mishnah, and Rav Ashi collected and published the Talmud? – There are two versions Rav Sherirah Gaon's letter, and according to one, they only collected but did not publish.

However, this never happens with communal offerings.
<br />
<br />
What are these personal sin-offerings? There are five types: offspring of a sin-offering, exchange of another sin-offering, a sin-offering whose owners died and are thus no longer in need of atonement, one whose owners used another sin-offering for their atonement (which can happen when the first offering is temporarily lost), and one that became older than a year. This law is known as one that, instead of logic, is based on a teaching passed from Moses through successive generations. However, Rabbi Yehudah argues and says that he possesses a more authentic version of the rule, according to which even communal offering in the same situation also has to die.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon is known to give  reasons for the rules of the Torah. He says that communal offerings need not die, and it can be proven by logic: for example, the sin-offering whose owners died, is not needed and therefore cannot be used. However, this is not applicable to the Community of Israel, which does not die.

Did I ever leave you for a moment? Have you not written about me in the Torah, '<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=33#P2482">And Joshua his servant would never left his tent</a>'!” Moses was pained by this answer, and as a result, three hundred law were forgotten by Joshua and seven hundred uncertainties arose in his mind. All of Israel wanted to kill Joshua, but God said to him, “I cannot tell you these laws anymore after the passing of Moses, following the principle that the Torah is not in Heaven, however, go and occupy Israel with war,” and that is the meaning of the verse “And it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of God, that God said to Joshua... cross over Jordan.”
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, this time Otniel ben Kenaz restored them through logic. That is the meaning of the phrase, “Otniel ben Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, conquered Kiryat Sefer (City of the Book), so Caleb gave him Achsah, Caleb's daughter, as a wife.” Why was she called Achsah (anger)? – Because she was so beautiful (and some say, so modest) that everyone who looked at her immediately became angered at his wife who lacked in comparison. Being married to a Torah scholar who spent all his time in studies, Achsah had nothing in her house. She went to her father, saying, “You have given me an arid land,” that is, devoid of all worldly goods. He gave her upper and lower springs. That means that he said, “One to whom belong all the mysteries of the world, the upper and lower, need not ask me for sustenance.” Rather, to him applies the verse from the Proverbs, “She (the Torah) is like a merchant's ships, from afar she brings her sustenance.”

<br />
<br />
On the other hand, although it is completely impossible to consecrate a blemished animal, one can exchange a blemished animal for a sacrifice, and this exchange will work. In that way, one can create a blemished sacrifice, and in this exchanges are more stringent than regular sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
And in this sacrifices and exchanges are the same: the offspring of a peace offering and its exchange&nbsp;are peace offerings; so are&nbsp;their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, until the end of time, with all the accompanying details. That is because peace offerings can be females, unlike, for example,&nbsp;burned&nbsp;offerings. Why did “end of time” have to be mentioned? – To disprove Rabbi Eliezer, who says on the next page that an offspring of a peace offering cannot be brought on the Altar.<br />

Why not? Really by the Torah law it can, but the Sages enacted a decree against it, to prevent him growing whole flocks of peace offerings.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that they disagreed only about one generation. Does Rabbi Shimon mean to say that a child is an offering but a grandchild is not? Indeed, Rabbah says that it would be a logical understanding. However, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says that the opposite is true, a child is not brought, but a grandchild is. Why? Because a grandchild of an offering would be a rare situation, and the Sages do not establish decrees for rare situations.
<br />
<br />
The law of thanksgiving offering is unanimous: its offspring and its exchange are both brought as thanksgiving offerings, except that they do not require the usual forty loaves of bread.

However, its exchange can be considered its descendant, in some sense. Additionally, if one exchanges it for a female animal, that female can in turn have descendants. All of these “descendants,” and their descendants, ad infinitum, are brought as burned offerings, with all their laws.
<br />
<br />
If one designates a female as a burned offering – which is invalid, as we have just said – it is left to graze until it develops a blemish. It is then redeemed, and the money is used for a valid male burned offering. If it gets a male offspring, it, too, is left to graze until it can be redeemed. Rabbi Eliezer says that the offspring itself can be offered.  What is the basis for their disagreement? Some say that by the Torah law Rabbi Eliezer is correct, but according to the Sages, there is an additional enactment and a burden on him, since one should not sanctify a female animal as a burned offering. Others say, that since the original offering was “pushed off” from the Altar, its direct descendants cannot be brought either, and the argument is about the effect of “pushing off.”

In addition, he violates a negative commandment, and is subject to lashes. Therefore, we have the first ruling: “All can effect exchange, a man or a woman, but this is not a permission to do so, rather, if he did it, it's done, and he is liable to lashes.”
<br />
<br />
Earlier we surveyed the use of “<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/01/arachin-3-what-does-word-all-add.html">All do this and that</a>” to show that the word “all” adds something not obvious. What does “All can effect exchange” add? It adds an heir who inherits a sacrifice of his father and who can effect exchange with that sacrifice (and get lashes for that). Then why is it not taught explicitly? Because it is not unanimous, and Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that just as the heir does not lean on the sacrifice, so too he cannot effect exchange. And Rabbi Meir (the author of all anonymous rulings)? – He agrees to the comparison, but the word “exchange” is said twice to include an heir.

<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZIJa25-BZu2qCXnEuTkzNsrZ0bbBMJuPL37wj-K1P_DNB6UMYJZGvIiYbuP4zJMLrI8nkiNqsm2gBl3QrUCdV_BtN6xu-K3A5jlgSdhJv3Cg2PD-jqek2dEh6f18G93CVDVa-xH4k5L5u/s1600/Rosa+Bonheur+-+Heads+Of+Sheep+And+Rams.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZIJa25-BZu2qCXnEuTkzNsrZ0bbBMJuPL37wj-K1P_DNB6UMYJZGvIiYbuP4zJMLrI8nkiNqsm2gBl3QrUCdV_BtN6xu-K3A5jlgSdhJv3Cg2PD-jqek2dEh6f18G93CVDVa-xH4k5L5u/s320/Rosa+Bonheur+-+Heads+Of+Sheep+And+Rams.jpg" width="320" /></a>Since guilt offering can only be a male, if one consecrates a female animal for this purpose, his consecration is invalid. Nevertheless, the animal's value does become consecrated, and this consecration spreads throughout the body of the animal. It cannot be brought on the Altar, but one has to let it graze until it gets a blemish, then sell it, and bring another, male animal for one's guilt offering. If meanwhile he already brought his guilt offering, this money is put into a collection box in the Temple, to buy sacrifices for the time when the Altar is idle. 
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, we see a principle that monetary sanctification leads to the full sanctification of the body. For example, if one designated a ram for its value, planning to sell it and buy another sacrifice, the ram itself becomes a sacrifice. Rabbi Shimon disagrees with this principle. Therefore, he says that the original guilt offering never became sanctified, and may be sold even without a blemish.
<br />
<br />
Other cases where an animal is sent to graze nclude the exchange of a guilt-offering – for nothing else can be done with it - and offspring, and the offspring of its offspring, ad infinitum.

Temurah 21 – Firstborn And Tithe Animals, Redux

Similarly, it becomes a tithe by happening to come out as the tenth, when the owner counts them coming out of a coral. Therefore, when one designates exchanges for them, these exchanges cannot be brought on the Altar. However, they do acquire other qualities of the firstborn and the tithe: they are let to graze, and when they get a blemish, they can be eaten by their owner. In this they are different from regular sacrifices: upon getting a blemish, they need no redemption and can be eaten by the owner, but regular sacrifices remain sanctified and require redemption.
<br />
<br />
Another difference: the meat of the firstborn and tithe animals cannot be sold in a market, nor weighed out with weights, since this is degrading, and the owner has to take a loss on that. On the other hand, the meat of regular sacrifices that became blemished and were redeemed, can be sold in the market and weighed out in the regular way. This will fetch them a higher price, which is desired, because that money will be used to buy the next sacrifice.

Temurah 22 – Child Of A Sin Offering

Now we can explain those cases.
<br />
<br />
A child of a sin offering cannot atone for any sin, since it was not consecrated for that purpose. It is nevertheless consecrated as a sacrifice, and, lacking a purpose, represents one of these cases. Was the animal already pregnant when consecrated, or did it conceive after being consecrated – that is a subject of an <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-11-sanctifying-fetus-of-animal.html">earlier disagreement between Rabbi Yochanan and Bar Padda</a>.
<br />
<br />
An exchange of a sin offering becomes consecrated. However, it cannot be offered as a sin offering, since consecrating the exchange it itself a sin.
<br />
<br />
A sin offering whose owner died is also left to die. Normally, a sacrifice is brought by the heirs of the deceased. However, a sin offering is no longer needed, since death itself serves as an atonement for one's sins.
<br />
<br />
A sin offering that has grown older than a year, or one that was lost and later found blemished, has a hope: if the owner already atoned for their sins with a different offering, it is left to die, but if he rather wanted to replace his defective sin offering with a valid one, then it is left to graze and sold when it gets a blemish, and the money is used for another sacrifice.

Temurah 23 – Lost Sin Offering

The first and the classic one was mentioned before: one designated an animal as a sin offering and it was lost, he offered another one in its stead, and then the first one was found – the first one  is now left to die. A case parallel to this one: one designated coins for his sin offering, the coins were lost, he achieved atonement with another offering, and then the coins were found – he should take the coins to the Dead Sea and cast them into its waters.
<br />
<br />
Another case is when he found the money earlier: he designated money for his sin offering, then lost it, designated another set of coins, but before he could buy a new animal, the first money was found. If he now uses one of the piles of coins, he would have to throw the other one into the Dead Sea, as we just learned. Rather, he mixes the two piles, and uses some of that money for his sin offering. The remainder is now classified as a surplus remaining from a sin offering and, for reasons we will learn later, can be put into the Temple chest for voluntary communal offerings. Other cases are just as interesting, but there is no room for them in our short summary.

Temurah 24 – The Conundrum of Surplus Funds From Sin Offering

On the one hand, we saw <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/03/temurah-23-lost-sin-offering.html">multiple cases where a left over sin offering is allowed to die</a>, and the leftover money is thrown into the Dead Sea. On the other hand, that was true for complete offerings and bundles of money, but here we have leftovers. Yehoyada the Kohen proved that the leftover money can be used to bring burned offerings of the congregation. His proof was based on the double language of “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=5#P2847">guilt, guilt</a>.” Since the second “guilt” was not needed, he applied it to sin offerings.
<br />
<br />
Since Yehoyada's proof was generally accepted and admired, why was there a need to formulate a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/03/temurah-23-lost-sin-offering.html">similar ruling we just learned</a>? – One might have thought that it applied only to leftovers of one sacrifice, and here we see that you can even mix the money of two.
<br />
<br />
A loophole to circumvent Kohen's rights in a firstborn animal: if one has in his flock an animal that is pregnant with her first offspring, he can says, “If it is pregnant with a male, let this male be consecrated as a burned offering.” There are also further combinations of his statements and possible multiple births of offspring of different genders.

Temurah 25 – Consecrating A Pregnant Animal

Since he consecrated the fetus first, his subsequent declaration applies to mother only.
<br />
<br />
However, if he said, "I designate this animal as a peace offering and its fetus as a burned offering," then both the animal and the fetus are peace offerings. His first words take effect immediately, and the mother becomes a peace offering, with everything inside her – that is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. His ruling principle as that we always “seize upon the first expression,” that is, we view the first part of his statement as decisive, and ignore any contradicting subsequent declarations.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose says that we ask him about his intent. If, from the outset, he wanted the mother to become a peace offering, and the fetus – a burned offering, then we view these desires as part of the same statement. It is impossible for a human to express both desires simultaneously, but only this prevented him from doing so, thus both his intentions takes effect. Rabbi Yose's principle is that both parts of one's statement are important. Only if he changed his mind in the middle, then his subsequent changes are ineffectual.

Temurah 26 – Double Exchange And No Exchange

If one had three animals in front of him: a burned offering, a peace offering, and a regular animal, and he declared, “Let this (regular) animal be an exchange for the burned offering, exchange for the peace offering,” then it became an exchange for the burned offering only – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Meir follows his view, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/03/temurah-25-consecrating-pregnant-animal.html">which we saw before</a>, that the first part of his statement is decisive. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose says, “If that is what he intended from the outset, then, since it is impossible to utter two designations simultaneously, his declaration stands, but if he changed his mind in the process, it does not take effect.” Rabbi Yose is also consistent with <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/03/temurah-25-consecrating-pregnant-animal.html">his view</a>, except that here he explicitly states his reason.
<br />
<br />
If one tried to make a sacrifice exchange but did not use the right term, for example, if he said, “Let this be deconsecrated onto that,” the exchange does not take place. However, if deconsecration was possible, such as when it was a sacrifice with a blemish, he effected the redemption. The new animal is consecrated, and if it is less expensive than the original one, he must add his money.

Temurah 27 – The Meaning Of “In Place”

<br />
<br />
However the words “in place” may mean different things, depending upon context. For example, in the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=13#P3073">and if the white leprosy discoloration remains in its place</a>,” it means “occupies the place,” similar to the sacrifice exchange, where one animal becomes a sacrifice instead of another one. On the other hand, when Isaiah says that “God promises to bring gold to replace copper stolen from His people,” this implies redemption, where the value of one object is replaced with the value of the other. In the world of sacrifices, this would be permitted redemption.
<br />
<br />
Abaye asked, “What if one said, 'These two animals are in place of those two blemished sacrifices,' did he mean prohibited exchange or permitted redemption?” When a person can do something in a permitted way, can we assume that he uses the chance, or does he want to do the wrong thing? He continued with the case of two animals, where one was unblemished, so that there he surely transgressed, but what about the other animal, where he could have done it in a permitted way? Then three animals, then four, where he already established a presumption of wrong-doing – does the person still have a chance? This remained unresolved.

Some animals are forbidden  to be offered on the Altar, and if they are mixed up with permitted animals, they forbid the whole herd, even hundreds and thousands, for the Altar.  These include one that sodomized a person or one that was sodomized, one that was designated for idolatrous purposes or actually worshipped, one given to a prostitute as a payment, one exchanged for a dog, a hybrid, a sick animal (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>), and one born of Caesarean section.
<br />
<br />
An animal designated for idolatry is prohibited, but what's on it may be used, however, an animal that was actually worshipped makes all of its garments and ornaments prohibited as well. Both are permitted to be eaten.
<br />
<br />
That is the rule, but we already learned a very similar rule a while back, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-71-animal-mix-up.html">in Zevachim</a>! There, if any of the five types of sin offerings that are not needed mixed with other animals, this makes the whole herd prohibited. Why is it repeated? Because in Zevachim all the mixed-in sacrifices were forbidden for benefit, so you might have thought that the ones above, who are permitted to regular use, don't prohibit the herd – the teacher had to tell us that they do.

What are the particulars? If one says to a harlot, “Take this lamb for your wage,” but gives her a hundred sheep, they are all forbidden for the Altar. Even though he promised only one sheep, and we could think that the other sheep are just a disinterested present, this teaches us that there is no such thing, and all sheep are her wage.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, if one says, “Take this lamb and let your slave-woman spend a night with my slave,” then Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that this is not “harlot's wage,” but the Sages say that it is. “Similarly” refers only to the Sages. How are we to understand this disagreement? The Sages say, “The man really means himself and 'my slave' is just a refined language for his male member.” Using refined language is praiseworthy. And what is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? He says that we are talking about a Hebrew slave, who is permitted to live with a slave-woman, and furthermore, the prohibition of harlot's wage apply only to prohibited women.

<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbmYKcARp-TqxLQFS3PgMS9ipkg_BLLIPFxtFA7Z_peHPCVyR6ZViAz8ErSN-NvFNeMYf1XaTqGGMieSxzWG76vk0e_pzFQginY00oZ9KjnEwrRIN7t5Wy4oa5-ikmhkycoQQ83rwCQKZJ/s1600/Italian+School+-+Little+Boy+In+Venice.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbmYKcARp-TqxLQFS3PgMS9ipkg_BLLIPFxtFA7Z_peHPCVyR6ZViAz8ErSN-NvFNeMYf1XaTqGGMieSxzWG76vk0e_pzFQginY00oZ9KjnEwrRIN7t5Wy4oa5-ikmhkycoQQ83rwCQKZJ/s320/Italian+School+-+Little+Boy+In+Venice.jpg" width="243" /></a>We can ask a few questions regarding sacrifice exchanges. Can a minor effect an exchange? If he is younger than twelve, there is not doubt that he cannot, because he cannot vow. But between twelve and thirteen his vows take effect. On the other hand, a minor is not punished, and since he cannot receive lashes, possibly he cannot effect exchange? We leave it unresolved.
<br />
<br />
Can an idolater effect exchange? Since he can bring sacrifices like an Israelite, perhaps he can. However, since he is never punished with lashes (unlike a minor who will reach the age of punishment), perhaps he cannot? Really, the answer here is clear that he cannot, because the Torah described the exchange only for “sons of Israel.” Rather, the questions is what happens when he promises a sacrifice on behalf of Jew. Is the one who consecrates the sacrifices or the one for whom it is consecrated more important? This is also left unresolved.
<br />
<br />
Why is one punished for exchange with lashes, if it is just words, and the usual rule is that one is only punished for an act (with some exceptions, such as cursing another with the name of God or makes a false oath)? However, the answer is that with his words he achieves an action, and therefore is punished as for an action.

Temurah 30 – The Wage Of A Dog

However, a wage of a dog and an exchange of a harlot are permitted. But why? Why not include those categories also? – Because the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5513">they both</a>&nbsp;are displeasing to God,” which means that only two are prohibited, not three or four. What is a wage of a dog? When one says, “Take this lamb as payment for letting me spend the night with your dog.”
<br />
<br />
If one gave a harlot coins as her wage, she can use them to buy a sacrifice – since only the actual item received as payment is prohibited as a sacrifice. However, if he gave her wine, oil, or flour, which can normally be brought in the Temple, these become prohibited. 
<br />
<br />
As we learned, animals that were worshipped or sodomized are prohibited for the Altar. However, their offspring are permitted. That is true only if they were first sodomized – which made them prohibited – and then they conceived, and the offspring is a mixture of the prohibited mother and permitted animal father. If they first conceived and then were sodomized, then Rabbi Eliezer says that the offspring are also prohibited, because it is considered as part of the mother, and was as if sodomized with the mother.

Temurah 31 – Altar And Temple Consecration Differences

By contrast, Temple consecrations are used for all other Temple needs, such as repairs. Each category is in some ways more special than the other.
<br />
<br />
Altar consecrations can be used to make a (forbidden) sacrifice exchange; the intention to eat them beyond allotted time, actually leaving them over, or eating them while impure makes one liable to punishment; even if they are redeemed, their offspring and milk are still prohibited; one who slaughters them outside the Temple is liable; they cannot be given to craftsmen working in the Temple as their fee. All of these are not true for Temple consecration.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Temple consecrations are special, because if a person consecrates something without specifying if he meant for the Altar or for the Temple, it becomes consecrated for the Temple. What grows from them is prohibited for use, and one commits misappropriation if he uses it. What is it? For example, eggs of a hen, or milk of a she-donkey. Finally, the Kohanim get no benefit from Temple consecrations, but they do receive a hide or a portion of meat from Altar consecrations.

Temurah 32 – Altar And Temple Consecration Similarities

If the owner of an animal that has been consecrated to the Temple for its value decided to change its sanctity and consecrated it to the Altar, he has accomplished nothing. Although Altar sanctity is higher than the Temple sanctity, it still does not take effect.
<br />
<br />
In the same vein, if an animal has already been consecrated to the Altar as one sort of offering, for example, as a peace offering, its sanctity cannot be changed to another one, such as burned offering.
<br />
<br />
If an animal consecrated for the Altar died, it must be buried. It cannot be redeemed, because, since it died of itself, even after redemption it can be only given to the dogs to eat, and it is not fitting to redeem a sacrifice if all we can do with it is feed it to the dogs. Some say that the reason here is different: even if the animal died through proper kosher slaughter, for redemption it has to stand up, as the Torah said, “and he shall stand the animal... and evaluate it,” and a dead animal cannot stand up.

Temurah 33 – For Redemption, The Sacrifice Must Be Standing

Earlier we said that a dead sacrifice cannot be redeemed, because it cannot stand up. The Torah said that, as part of the redemption process, the animal must undergo evaluation while it is standing. Since a dead animal cannot stand up, it cannot be redeemed. However, we still don't know if this refers to Altar consecrations, or to Temple consecrations. Rabbi Yochanan maintains that it refers to both; thus, a sanctified can never be redeemed, once it died by itself. 
<br />
<br />
However, Resh Lakish, his student and constant companion in arguments, says that this requirement applies only to Temple consecrations, but animals that were consecrated as sacrifices on the Altar do not require standing up for evaluation, and may therefore be redeemed if they die. 
<br />
<br />
Their disagreement is questioned on the basis of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who said that “Temple sacrifices that died may be redeemed.” According to Rabbi Yochanan, we understand why Rabbi Shimon had to clarify his disagreement. But according to Resh Lakish, why didn't Rabbi Shimon simply state, “They may be redeemed,” since we already know that we are talking about Temple sanctification? – Rabbi Shimon did not precisely know the position of the first teacher, and preferred to state his view in every detail.

<br />
<br />
And the following are burned: chametz on Passover – since Rabbi Yehudah says that it is the proper way to destroy it; Kohen's portion of grain that became ritually impure – because it would be too easy to make a mistake and use it; and fruit of a tree for the first three years (orlah), as well as grain that grew in a vineyard – for the same reason of preventing a mistake.
<br />
<br />
All things that must be buried may not be burned, and vice versa. Why is that? Because in the case of things that must be buried, their ash is also forbidden for benefit, but for things that must be burned – their ash is permitted.

Temurah 4 – Transgression Without An Action
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhu_UZToZ1sFozNoZZz-htkvSzrkGcFc-HSCEPSAB4P_w2rx-cyoSnSSaXzWxPLzddBzAyAsk6bgooZxzZ2XH1yifPL0xwqtGZetSV6hVFgqMo5Jrx07A91CdpwR9c4T9XzVljWsVyltRtn/s1600/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+Young+Girl+In+A+Straw+Hat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhu_UZToZ1sFozNoZZz-htkvSzrkGcFc-HSCEPSAB4P_w2rx-cyoSnSSaXzWxPLzddBzAyAsk6bgooZxzZ2XH1yifPL0xwqtGZetSV6hVFgqMo5Jrx07A91CdpwR9c4T9XzVljWsVyltRtn/s320/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+Young+Girl+In+A+Straw+Hat.jpg" width="264" /></a></div>
As a rule, one can be punished only for actions, not speech or thoughts. There are&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-3-questions-about-sacrifice.html">exceptions to this rule</a>, sacrifice exchange being one of them. Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Chanina adds one more: one who first separates the kohen's portion, and afterwards the first fruit from his crop, as the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=22#P2140">Your first fruit and the kohen's portion don't delay</a>.” &nbsp;Since the kohen's portion can be designated in thought alone, one is liable to lashes for a thought.
<br />
<br />
Another rule is that if a prohibition can be remedied, then one does not receive lashes for it. But, is that always true? For example, sacrifice exchange has a remedy – treating the new sacrifice with the laws of&nbsp;sacrificial&nbsp;holiness, and one still gets lashes!? – Exchange is prohibited twice, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3578">don't exchange and don't substitute</a>”, so it is especially severe.
<br />
<br />
But consider a case of one who violates a young unmarried girl. He has to marry and never divorce her. If he does divorce her, he needs to take her back. If he can't take her back, because he is a Kohen, who is forbidden to marry a divorcée, he gets lashes. But why? He is not doing anything! – Kohanim are special, they have extra prohibitions.

The “you may not” is represented by Abaye, and “you can not” - by Rava. According to Abaye, if one violates a law, he is punished with lashes, because his act was effective. But according to Rava, why is he punished, if he achieved nothing? – Simply because he violated the statement of the Merciful One.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud presents fourteen challenges, some to Abaye and some to Rava. Below are a two of them.
<br />
<br />
One who violates a girl has to marry her and can never divorce her. If he does divorce her, he has to re-marry her (if she agrees), but he is not given lashes. Why not? According to Rava, he should receive lashes for just violating the commandment!? Rava answers that it is a special case: since he needs to re-marry her, in a sense he achieved nothing.
<br />
<br />
What about sacrifice exchange, where <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-2-sacrifice-exchange.html">we learned that</a>, although forbidden, the act takes effect? Rava will answer that it is an exception, since the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3578">It and its exchange will be holy,</a>” but normally an illegal act achieves nothing.

<br />
<br />
The fourteenth challenge is against Abaye, from the laws of pe'ah, corners of the field, which one must leave for the poor. If he has not left some standing crop as pe'ah, he can leave it from the sheaves, or any time until the end of the harvest process. Rabbi Ishmael says that he can separate it even from dough.  How can Abaye say that “it's done” for this transgression? Rabbi Ishmael teaches that the farmer never acquires pe'ah, but it always remains the property of the poor! Abaye answers that the Torah repeated the commandment to leave pe'ah, to emphasize that the farmer never acquires it.
<br />
<br />
In all fourteen cases Abaye and Rava actually agreed with each other, even if for different reasons. If so, where do they differ? Perhaps they argue about illegal interest, Abaye saying that the lender acquired it and does not have to return it to the borrower, while Rava saying that he does? – No, interest is more serious than that. Rather, they argue about a thief who stole an item and changed its shape. Does he acquire the item, but has to repay its value (Abaye), or does he not acquire the item and has to return it, even if he changed it (Rava).

Now the Talmud proves that which it previously took for granted.
<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=22#P3387">A sacrifice with a blemish you shall not offer</a>”. Since the prohibition to slaughter was already stated before, this “you shall not offer” must mean, “you shall not consecrate.” From here we see that one who consecrates a blemished animal and burns this sacrifice on the Altar, transgresses fives times: “do not consecrate,” “do not slaughter,” “do not throw the blood,” “do not burn all of it,” and “do not burn part of it.” Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Yehudah adds one more for receiving its blood.
<br />
<br />
What is the source of the opinion of Rabbi Yose? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=22#P3387">Any sacrifice which is blemished you shall not offer... any whose testicles are crushed... you shall not offer... from the hand of a stranger you shall not offer.</a>”  The third “you shall not offer” is extra and applies to another law – receiving the blood. And the first teacher, why doesn't he agree? – He says that this is the normal language of the Torah, and nothing is to be derived from it.

<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD6t66LK6jGTw9yccRUXDHs2MmUMHmnEnA3TeH1j1HDwHerZnya_OmMYRJovd7wM9RmbpHwh9YX-_AXz9JgAn5iqTUjgddSCyttwSZSizcYjNi89Oc497qtXcLzyIFlRJX0sHQrQeTiCtz/s1600/William-Adolphe+Bouguereau+-+A+Newborn+Lamb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD6t66LK6jGTw9yccRUXDHs2MmUMHmnEnA3TeH1j1HDwHerZnya_OmMYRJovd7wM9RmbpHwh9YX-_AXz9JgAn5iqTUjgddSCyttwSZSizcYjNi89Oc497qtXcLzyIFlRJX0sHQrQeTiCtz/s320/William-Adolphe+Bouguereau+-+A+Newborn+Lamb.jpg" width="165" /></a>The exchange is effected by saying “Let this animal become a sacrifice instead of that one.” “That one” animal, on which the exchange is based, must be his, otherwise, the declaration does not work. Therefore, Kohanim can make exchanges for animals that they sacrifice and that belong to them. However, they can't make exchanges for animals that were given over to them by a Jew to be sacrificed – despite the fact that after it is slaughtered, they can eat its meat. Regular Jew can make exchange for his sacrifices, even though by now the sacrifice really belong to the Temple – but he has some ownership in it, since the sacrifice achieves his atonement.
<br />
<br />
Even though a first-born animal is given over to a Kohen and is his property, the Kohen cannot make exchange for it. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri asked, “Why not?” Rabbi Akiva explained, “They are like all other sacrifices.” Rabbi Yochanan objected, “But a first-born is his property!” Rabbi Akiva replied, “When did the first-born become sanctified? When it was born, in the house of its owner! It and its exchange must be in the same domain, but now it is in the hand of the Kohen, thus exchange is not possible.”

Temurah 9 – Exchange And Substitute – What Is The Difference?

<br />
<br />
Actually, the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3578">Don't exchange and don't substitute</a>.” What is the difference between the two? Exchange means for another's&nbsp;animal, and substitute – for one's own. But we just learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-8-you-can-only-make-exchange.html">one cannot use another's animal for exchange</a>?! – We are dealing with the case of one who sanctified his animal with these words: “Let this be a sacrifice, and anyone who wants to use it for an exchange, can use it.”<br />
<br />
One can exchange one sacrificial animal for two, two for one, and even a hundred for one (and get a hundred sets of lashes for that). Rabbi Shimon says that one can exchange only one for one, since the Torah said “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3578">It (one) and its exchange (also one) will be holy</a>.” What can the Sages answer? They say that “animal” (behemah) sometimes means multiple, like in the case of Jonah, who said, “and many animals” (behemah rabah). How can Rabbi Shimon defend himself now? – “Behemah rabah” indeed means many animals, but just “behemah” means only one.

Yevamot 10 – Case number sixteen

Here it is.
<br />
<br />
Let us say one's mother was legally married to his father (a standard case), but after his father's death, she "married" his brother (from another woman). The "marriage" of his mother and his brother never took legal effect because she was previously married to the brother's father. Therefore, if his brother now dies, there isn't even a suggestion that he should marry his mother in yibum.
<br />
<br />
However, if his father "violated" his mother – that is, lived with her without getting married – then his brother (his father's son from another woman) can indeed marry his mother. If this brother now dies, our protagonist finds himself in the position of a yibum; but since he cannot marry his mother, she does not get a yibum or chalitzah from him, and his brother's other wives also don't need a yibum or chalitzah. This is precisely the situation of the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html">fifteen cases above</a>, and this is case number sixteen that Levy wanted to include.<br />
<br />
If so, why did Rabbi Yehudah disagree? – Because this scenario involves an "if-he-does" case, a prohibited act of son "marrying" his father's former wife, and Rabbi Yehudah claims that such cases which involve a transgression were not included in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html">basic rule</a>.

Yevamot 100 – Questionable paternity

<br />
<br />
If, in addition, with both men she had more sons, then it is not clear if the child is the brother of the first family or of the second one. Therefore, if he marries and dies childless, there is a question of who should do yibum with his widow. The answer is that both sets of brothers have to give her a chalitzah, because he may have been their full brother, and she is therefore part of the family. 
<br />
<br />
However, nobody can do a yibum with her. That is because he may have been only from the same mother but not from their father, in which case his widow is forbidden as a former wife of their brother, while the mitzvah of yibum does not apply because it is only for paternal brothers.

If both men were Kohanim, one would be marrying a divorcee, and his child would lose his status of a Kohen, so he would be allowed to go to a cemetery. Since the ruling prohibits this, it cannot be talking about not waiting after a regular divorce.
<br />
<br />
In the same vein, the Talmud excludes all other cases and is left with one: she lived with each man without any legal framework, had a child from one of them, and the term "husband" was not meant literally, only for the clean language. Incidentally, even if this child strikes both husbands, he is not punished because we don't know who the real father is; thus cannot give him a proper warning, and punishment cannot be given without a formal warning.<br />
<br />
Now for the mitzvah of chalitzah. The woman recites the verses about the brother not wishing to "establish his brother's house," the man confirms that he does not want to marry her, then she removes his shoe, spits toward him, and recites "so it will be done to a man who will not build his brother's house."

<br />
<br />
Chalitzah requires five people: three to <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5549">act as judges</a> and two – to make the fact well-known. The Kohanim then will know not to marry her, and other people, by contrast, will see that she is available.
<br />
<br />
Part of the procedure is for her to remove his shoe. The shoe should be proper, made from leather, and fit to be worn. As an enhancement, they add a strap to the shoe, so that that the two actions – untying the strap, and the removing the shoe – leave no doubt in the validity of the procedure. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yannai asked, "What if she tore the shoe off his foot or burned it off his foot? Do we need the foot to become exposed – and that is achieved – or do we need proper removal?" – To this, there was no answer.

Yevamot 103 – Did Jews receive chalitzah from God?

Since Hosea said, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1305.htm">With their sheep and cattle they will come to see God, but won't find, for He has withdrawn ('chalatz') from them</a>." Thus, God has ended His unique relationship with the Jews. Rabban Gamliel answered him, "You are a fool! The words are not 'He has given chalitzah' but 'He has chalitzah from them!' That is, they tried to give a chalitzah to God. But if a woman in this situation removes her shoe, does she remove the bond from her husband's brothers? Certainly not!" Thus, the Jews may have acted incorrectly, but the bond remains.
<br />
<br />
Additional details of chalitzah: it cannot be done with a sock, but a shoe fit for walking is needed. And, since the woman has to "remove it from his foot," an amputee whose leg was cut off above his knee cannot give a chalitzah. The one whose foot was amputated can walk on it, albeit with difficulty; thus, his chalitzah would be valid.

Yevamot 104 – Which part of the leg is good for chalitzah?

But this does not seem right! When one goes to Jerusalem on a Festival,  such as Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot, which are also called "Regalim," to indicate that one goes on foot, only people who have feet ("regel") have to go to the Temple, and one with prosthetic foot does not. This tells us that "regel" means foot, and chalitzah should not be allowed without it! - No, chalitzah is special: since Torah says, "From above his foot," "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5551">Me-al regel</a>," this tells us that the part of the leg above the foot but below the knee is also included. But if so, let's also include the thigh! – No, the thigh would be "above above" the foot, and that's too much.
<br />
<br />
And yet, there are five places where thighs are also called "regel," such as in the story of Yael. When general Sisera came to her tent, Yael offered him "milk in royal vessels" - from her breasts. He subsequently had intercourse with her seven times, as indicated by the verse "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0705.htm">He fell between her feet (regel), bent, fell, lay</a>..." where the variation of "fell" is mentioned seven times. So  thighs are also called ("regel")?! – No, in truth, thighs are not called "regel," but here it was done for propriety, out of respect for the righteous Yael and her deed, weakening Sisera and killing him in the end.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, why does Yael deserve so much praise? Granted, even though she was a married woman, her transgression was a permitted, and even righteous deed, since she intended to help the whole Jewish people. Still, she derived some pleasure from the act!? At least we should remove the words "More praiseworthy than all women (meaning Matriarchs) is Yael!" – No, since we have a rule that even a minor benefit from the wicked is abhorrent to the righteous, it can be said that Yael derived no pleasure whatsoever.

Of these actions, only taking off the shoe is essential; the other two, while important, will not invalidate the chalitzah if they are not done.
<br />
<br />Rabbi Yehudah the Prince recommended Levi for a Rabbinical post in a particular village. When Levy arrived, they put him on a platform and asked him the following questions. Can a woman with amputated hands do a chalitzah? If she spits blood instead of saliva, what is the law? Levy did not know. They asked him a non-legal question: when an angel tells Daniel, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3410.htm">I will tell you what is inscribed in truthful wording</a>," can there be untruthful wording in Heaven?
<br />
<br />
Levy went to ask in the Academy. They told him, "Does it say that she shall remove the shoe with her hand? – No! So she can do it with her teeth. Furthermore, does it say that she spits with a spit? – No, it just says that she spits, in any manner." Regarding the last question, the wording is given the appellation of "truthful" when accompanied by an oath and cannot be changed. The Talmud then discusses when a Heavenly decree can be reversed and when it cannot.

<br />
Let's look closer. Granted, there was no "court" in prison, but if there are no witnesses, the event is considered as if it did not happen, so how could it be kosher? – In truth, there were witnesses, but they stood outside.
<br />
<br />Who specifically was in prison? –  The story happened when the man and the woman were in prison, and Rabbi Akiva was also in prison. More details: Rabbi Yochanan Sandler pretended to be a peddler. He cried, "Who wants needles? Does anyone want knitting knots? What about a chalitzah between only him and her?" Rabbi Akiva heard and answered, "Do you have spindles ("koshin")? do you have kosher?" – and that indicated his decision on the matter.
<br />
<br />
A mistaken chalitzah is nevertheless valid. How so? One man wanted to do yibum to a woman just because of her money, but she did not want him. The judge told him, "Make a chalitzah, and with this, you will acquire her." The brother did so. Then the judge said, "Really, you are now disqualified from marrying her, so why not give her a real chalitzah?" The brother had to comply.

People lived short lives, and their next day was uncertain, so early engagement and marriage were critical. The Torah provides legal authority for the father of a girl to give her away in marriage before she reaches maturity. However, if the father was not alive, getting married was a problem: the underage girl lacked legal authority to accept an engagement for herself. In her family, the Torah gave this authority only to her father. Therefore, the Sages instituted for the mother and the girl's brothers to arrange her marriage. Yet, the legal basis for this marriage lay in the authority of the Sages and not in the Torah. It could be dissolved by the girl deciding that she does not like her husband and does not want to continue the marriage. This is called a "miyun" or "refusal." How exactly does this happen?
<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai says that she can refuse the marriage only after engagement but not after the marriage is complete with the chuppah. Had refusal been allowed when they are already living together, people might make a mistake and say that marriage with an adult woman can be dissolved without a divorce (Get), perhaps if the marriage conditions were not fulfilled. However, Beit Hillel allows her to refuse anytime: people know that a marriage of a minor girl is unique and can be dissolved without a Get. 
<br />
<br />
Another type of logic: Beit Shammai says that if the girl can walk away, the man will not prepare the wedding reception, with all associated expenses, just to see it go to waste. However, Beit Hillel allows her to refuse any time: both the man and the woman want their wedding to be known, so the man will not hesitate to throw a feast to get married.

Yevamot 120 – When to testify about the husband's death

They must, however, be confident that it is indeed the right man. Therefore, they only do it if they see the dead man's head with the nose, although the eyes and the mouth need not be intact. They cannot make an identification based on the man's body or his garments.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, they must be sure that he indeed died. For example, if they saw him suffer from a deadly wound, hanging from the gallows, or being devoured by a wild beast, they may not testify. He might have received medical help and recovered, the rope might have been cut, or the beast might stop before reaching a vital organ. 
<br />
<br />
As a rule, they may also not testify if the man died more than three days ago – although there are exceptions where he can be recognized long afterward. 
<br />
<br />
A story to illustrate that the face and the nose are crucial for recognition. Abba bar Marta owed money to the family of the Exilarch. He took wax, attached it to a rag, and put the rag on his forehead. He then passed in front of his creditors, who did not recognize him.

Yevamot 121 – A man fell into water

If one fell into a water reservoir, whether a small one, such that all of it can be observed, or one larger than that – he might still be saved, and his wife cannot re-marry based on this testimony alone. Rabbi Meir quotes an incident to support this ruling: a man fell into a large water cistern and emerged after three days. This proves that even in such situations, there is a possibility that the construction of a cistern or a pond will allow him to survive. Certainly, in a large body of water, he could have been saved by waves, for example, and emerged far away, out of the sight of observers.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yose and other Sages disagree. Rabbi Yose quotes a different incident and even a ruling: one blind person went into a cave to immerse himself for ritual purity but fell in. His assistant descended after him and also fell in. After the period of time that it would take for them to surely die, the court allowed their wives to re-marry, even though the bodies were never recovered. 
<br />
<br />
What do the Sages answer to Rabbi Meir's incident? – They say it was a miracle anyway and cannot serve as a basis for legal rulings. Why do they call it a miracle? If it is because he did not eat for three days - Esther and the whole Jewish people fasted for three days and survived. Instead, it is because he did not sleep for three days, which is impossible. And Rabbi Meir? – He leaned upon the arches that were inside the cistern and slept. And the Sages? – The arches were of marble, and he would have slipped and fallen. And Rabbi Meir? – He would wake up before falling. Thus, each can defend his point of view.

Even the talk of minors, who are not considered legally competent, suffices for this. 
<br />
<br />
But perhaps those minor children were just playing funerals and eulogies, as they are wont to do? – We mean a case when they return from a funeral and mention people who were present there.
<br />
<br />
An idolater's statement is also sufficient to testify – provided he was just relating the events without any self-interest. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva told a story: once, he had to go to Nahardea in Babylon to establish a leap year. While there, he encountered Nechemyah from Beit Deli. Nehemiah told him that, contrary to the prevailing opinion at that time, he had a tradition from Rabban Gamliel that one witness of the husband's death was enough to allow the wife to re-marry. Since the country was full of ravaging troops, he appointed Rabbi Akiva as his messenger to relate this back to Israel. When Rabban Gamliel the grandson heard it, he rejoiced because they now found corroboration for this opinion, already espoused by Rabbi Yehudah ben Bava, and the law was established – thus allowing many widows to re-marry.

Yevamot 13 – A mitzvah marriage of Beit Hillel is illegitimate for Beit Shammai

<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai disagrees with this basic rule and permits one to marry a co-wife of the deceased brother. This leads to many significant consequences.&nbsp;For example, if co-wives perform a halitzah, they are divorcees. They cannot marry a Kohen – that is according to Beit Shammai, but for Beit Hillel, who say that the halitzah was not needed in the first place and means nothing even if performed – they can still marry a Kohen.<br />
<br />
More importantly, if a brother of the deceased makes a yibum to his co-wife and marries her, following the opinion of Beit Shammai that this allowed, the children of such marriage will be mamzerim, according to Beit Hillel. Mamzerim are not allowed to marry a Jew, and the child of a mamzer is still a mamzer!
<br />
<br />
Even though they had such dividing disagreements, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel still maintained a friendly relationship, would intermarry, and relied on each other for purity laws of sacrifices. This is because they trusted each other so that if a situation that is permitted according to one but forbidden to another arose, they knew that they would be honestly informed.

Yevamot 15 – Did Beit Shammai do it?

Earlier, we learned that a marriage permitted according to Beit Shammai would lead, according to Beit Hillel, to a severe consequence of a child being a mamzer and being forbidden to marry a Jew. Therefore, the question is, did Beit Shammai actually follow their point of view in practice?
<br />
<br />
One attempt to decide this is by analyzing the story of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, who said, "How are we to resolve it? Should we simply agree with Beit Shammai? But the child is mamzer, according to Beit Hillel! And if we simply agree with Beit Hillel – but the child of the marriage they allow is not fit to marry a Kohen, soon we will not have priests! Rather, let's do this: in every such case, let us do a chalitzah, but not a yibum. Since we ban yibum, we will never come into a problem with Beit Hillel: even if they do halitzah, it is meaningless, and so no harm. And according to Beit Shammai, this will also be acceptable because they require either a yibum or chalitzah. However, the Sages never got to vote and put this measure into practice."<br />
<br />
Can we deduce from this that Beit Shammai actually acted according to their view? For otherwise, what “previous cases” are we talking about? 
<br />
<br />
Not necessarily! It could be that this measure was not flawless for a different reason. By "previous cases," we mean the cases of Beit Hillel: the husbands who married their wives following the view of Beit Hillel will now observe their wives getting chalitzah from another man, implying that the husband's marriage was illegal until then! This cannot be, for "All the Torah's ways are pleasantness, and all its paths are peace."<br />

Yevamot 17 – A very young brother

However, if the brother is not contemporary, he cannot do a yibum. What do you mean?
<br />
<br />
There are two brothers, Reuven and Shimon, and Reuven dies childless. Shimon should now marry Reuven's wife, but he waits. Meanwhile, a third brother, Levi, is born. Now Shimon marries the widow. He has his own wife also, and now he dies – the two wives are looking at Levy. However, Levy cannot marry the first one because she is his brother's wife, and when Levi was born, Reuven was already not alive. Thus, the first wife goes free and does not need either yibum or chalitzah from Levi. The second wife goes free because of the first one. This is one of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html">the fifteen women of the basic rule</a>, but we treat it in more detail here.
<br />
<br />
How do we know that the above is true? The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5547">If two brothers live together (in the world)</a>" – which means that the two brothers should be contemporaries, and then the laws of yibum apply. If not, the other brother's wife is always forbidden to the young brother.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, this phrase also teaches us that it applies only to brothers of the same father – just like the twelve brothers who were the sons of Jacob and are called brothers – so here too, "brothers" should be from the same father.

Yevamot 18 – Bond of yibum

The remaining brother either does a yibum (marries her) or gives her a chalitzah (releases her). This bond thus is similar to marriage.
<br />
<br />
How strong is it? Do we say that it is almost like a marriage that already exists? Take, for example, this case: a woman whose husband died is awaiting a yibum, but then she dies. Can the brother marry this woman's mother? If the brother and the woman were actually married, then, of course, he cannot also marry her mother. But they were never married – they were only connected through a yibum-bond.
<br />
<br />
Rav Huna says that yes, he can marry her mother. There is no strong connection created by the yibum bond. Now the Talmud begins to analyze the statement. Why didn't Rav Huna simply state, "There is no bond!?" If he did that, we might have thought that even while the woman (yevamah) is still alive, he can disregard the bond and marry her mother. This is not so, however: one is forbidden to destroy the potential for the mitzvah of yibum, and that is what he would have done by marrying the mother.
<br />
<br />
Rav Yehudah disagrees and says that one cannot marry the mother in this situation. The same question: why didn't Rav Yehudah simply state that "there is a bond?!" – He wants to teach us another lesson. If he said, "There is a bond," we might have thought that it is valid only when there is only one remaining brother, which is why the bond is strong. But should there be many brothers, and the power of the bond be divided among them, then perhaps it would not stop a brother from marrying the woman's mother – so Rav Yehudah had to state this prohibition for all brothers.

A unique situation arises when a man cannot marry her for a different reason, such as if she is the man's daughter. And, since he cannot marry his daughter and does not even need a chalitzah, the other wives of the deceased brother are also released without a yibum or chalitzah.
<br />
<br />
Two things require explanation. How can a man's brother be married to his daughter? Should not such a marriage be prohibited? The answer is that there is no prohibition in the Torah to marry one's niece, but one can't marry his aunt. What about the other wives (co-wives)? How is that allowed? The answer here is that a man is permitted many wives by Torah law. The Talmud lists fifteen close relatives of a man he cannot marry and who are thus automatically released from chalitzah or yibum, together with their co-wives.
<br />
<br />
Today, one cannot marry many wives, and yibum is not allowed, but the chalitzah is still required.

Yevamot 22 – Any child

The Torah said that only when "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5547">and one of them dies childless</a>" does the mitzvah of yibum apply.
<br />
<br />
What did the teacher mean by "any child?" He could have said it shorter, "A child." – Even a mamzer – a son born from a woman married to another. But how do we know that? Maybe the Torah discusses only a legitimate son? – From the words "And he has no son," - "U ben ein lo." The term "ein" can be understood as "ain," which would mean an eye, telling us to look into the matter and discover any existing son. For example, if he has a daughter, she also exempts her mother from yibum. The exception to this case is a child born from a slave or a non-Jewish woman, who is not considered the man's offspring for the purposes of Jewish law.
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, “any brother” to whom the mitzvah of yibum applies also includes a mamzer. He is also a real brother for burial – so that if the father is a Kohen, and this son of his dies, then other brothers are permitted to go to the cemetery for his burial. This brother also inherits together with the other brothers, and he is liable for cursing his father. 
<br />
<br />
The last point needs explanation. The Torah said, "Do not curse a prince (and anyone in general) in your people," so this prohibition only applies to people who observe Torah laws and do "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=22#P2139">the conduct of your people</a>." This father sired a mamzer, and he is not doing the right thing, so the son should not be liable for cursing him!? – The father repented. But the mamzer is alive, so the repentance cannot work! – No, it can, because at least now the father behaves appropriately.

As a result, many family laws do not apply. For example, the child is not included in the inheritance rules. If that child is a daughter, then the man's son can marry her after she converts. The Sages later forbade this marriage to avoid confusion.
<br />
<br />
How do we know this rule? – The Torah said,"  "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=7#P5110">Do not intermarry with them... for he will turn your children away from Me, and they will serve other gods</a>" Why did the Torah say "he" and not "she" or"  "they?" Because the relationship is not equal. He (the non-Jewish husband of your Jewish daughter) will lead your Jewish children astray. Hence, this is still your child. But she (the non-Jewish wife of your Jewish son) will not lead your Jewish children astray – because they are not considered Jewish, they are not "your" children for the Jewish law.
<br />
<br />
Can we deduce that in the opposite case, when a non-Jew marries a Jewish woman, the child is entirely kosher? – Not quite. He is not an illegitimate child; he is not a mamzer, but he is blemished: if the child is a daughter, she cannot marry a Kohen.

If a man betrothed one of two sisters but does not know which of them he betrothed – he needs to give a divorce (Get) to each one. He cannot live with any one of them – because perhaps he betrothed the other one, and this one is prohibited to him as his wife's sister.
<br />
<br />
If he dies before divorcing, his brother performs a chalitzah with both – on the eventuality that each can be his brother's wife. 
<br />
<br />
If he had two brothers, then one must do a chalitzah with one, but the other brother can marry the other sister. This is permitted according to both possibilities: if her sister, who got the chalitzah, was really the wife – then the bond is now dissolved, and he can marry the other sister. And if her sister was not the true wife, then the chalitzah meant nothing, and the brother is now marrying his deceased brother's wife, that is, doing a yibum.
<br />
<br />
However, they cannot both marry, each one to a sister. The one who marries the true wife is doing a yibum, and that is fine. But the other one – he is marrying a woman to whom there is a yibum-bond, something <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-18-bond-of-yibum.html">we discussed earlier</a>. Still, if they don't consult and just go ahead and marry, they can stay married – because each one can claim that he did the yibum, and it is the other brother who was in violation, and now anyway, the yibum bond is no longer there.<br />
<br />
The eldest brother is the one who should do the yibum, but if the younger one has preceded him – he has acquired the mitzvah.

Yevamot 26 – Four brothers and two sisters
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

If there were four brothers, two of whom were married to two sisters, and the married brothers died, how do the remaining brothers perform the mitzvah of yibum? The easiest solution seems to be that each brother marries (does yibum) one of the sisters. However, as we discussed before, there is a concept of "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-18-bond-of-yibum.html">bond</a>": each live brother is considered to be married to some degree to each of the two sisters, through the possibility of yibum with her. Thus, since he has this bond with one sister, he cannot marry the other one because this other sister is as if his wife's sister. The same reasoning applies to both sisters: this bond precludes him from marrying the other. Therefore, they should give a chalitzah to each of the sisters.
<br />
<br />
We have explained this rule by the existence of the bond. However, not everybody accepts this idea. Some say that such bond does not exist. How then would they explain the rule that the brother in this situation can only do chalitzah but not yibum? – He will say: consider the possibility that one of the brothers does yibum, but then the other brother dies. The remaining sister now cannot marry the live brother, because he has already married her sister. Nor is there another brother to marry her. Thus, she needs no yibum or chalitzah, and the mitzvah of yibum is dissolved and lost. One should not loose a mitzvah, and this is why the yibum is forbidden by the Sages. Instead, the brothers should do a chalitzah, so that the mitzvah is performed at least in some way, rather than disappear altogether.

One of the married brothers dies, and the bachelor now has to do a mitzvah of yibum or chalitzah with the widow.
<br />
<br />
Although the mitzvah of yibum simply means that the brother lives with the widow, the Sages established an additional "statement of intent to marry," which looks like a betrothal. The bachelor acts as proper and makes this statement. However, then the second brother dies. What is the situation of yibum now?
<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai sees no problem: he can keep his wife, to which he made a statement, and the other one – she is his wife's sister – does not need either a yibum or a chalitzah. Beit Shammai regards a statement as a valid betrothal, making them husband and wife. Usually, before they can live together, there must be a marriage ceremony, but because yibum already allows them, it is not required.
<br />
<br />
However, Beit Hillel says that the statement only looks like a betrothal, but being that it is not a real one, but only an action instituted by the Sages for propriety, she is not his legal wife. Therefore, he cannot keep her – because there is another sister with whom he is connected with the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-18-bond-of-yibum.html">bond of yibum</a>, nor can he marry that sister because of the same bond, plus his additional statement; in both cases, he is as if marrying his wife's sister, which is forbidden. Therefore, he must do a chalitzah with the first sister and give her a divorce document (Get) because of his prior statement. He then needs to do chalitzah with the other sister. He is thus left without any wife through no fault of his own.

Yevamot 30 – What does the intent to marry accomplish?

Note, however, that the couple is already married in some sense: the mitzvah of yibum is accomplished by intercourse, and strictly speaking, no other formalities are required. Therefore, what does the declaration of this intent accomplish, an engagement or a complete marriage?
<br />
<br />
That was the question posed by Rabbah. Abaye asked – for what practical purpose are we asking? If it is for a Kohen to allow him to bury her if she dies – the answer is clear: even for a real engaged bride, a Kohen is not allowed to go to the cemetery, and certainly not for one with whom there is only an intent to marry.  And if the question is, do we need a chuppah marriage ceremony, then the answer is clear also: he could do a yibum even against her will, so now that he made a declaration, does it make it any worse? Of course, he does not need a chuppah!
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbah answered that this is not so simple. Before the declaration, he indeed had the right to do yibum. But now that he made it, maybe he lost this right, got the right of a mere engagement instead, and does need a chuppah.
<br />
<br />
The question remains without a conclusive proof, and besides it concerns only the opinion of Beit Shammai, while the practical law always accords with the opposing opinion of Beit Hillel.

However, now Shimon's own wife dies, and he and his brother's widow are left alone. Nothing stands in the way of Shimon making yibum with his brother's widow – but this is not true. Since Reuven's widow was forbidden to Reuven at some point of time, this prohibition now stands forever, and he cannot marry her. 
<br />
<br />
What if he married her, despite being told not to? – He is liable on two counts: she is his brother's wife, and she is his wife's sister. However, Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that he is only liable because of the first prohibition, and some say – only because of the second. How can Rabbi Shimon hold two opinions at once? Actually, there is no contradiction. The second opinion applies when Shimon married his wife first (so that now the second sister is already forbidden to him as his wife's sister). Then Reuven married his wife (so that the second prohibition is not superimposed over the first one). The first opinion refers to the opposite chronological order.

Yevamot 35 – The widow who is pregnant

However, since the widow may be pregnant, the Sages established that neither yibum nor chalitzah can be done for ninety days after the brother dies.
<br />
<br />
If the brother violated this decree and performed chalitzah earlier, and then it was found out that the widow was pregnant – which means that the brother did not die childless -- then the chalitzah was meaningless. As a result, he is still allowed to marry the widow's relatives – because he was never connected to her. Likewise, she is permitted to marry his relatives: a valid chalitzah is considered a divorce, thus forbidding her to marry his relatives, but this chalitzah is considered nothing. She is not a divorcee and can even marry a Kohen.
<br />
<br />
However, if the brother hurried to do a yibum but found that his brother's wife was already pregnant with a child, then he was not allowed to do a yibum, because it does not apply in the presence of a child. Since he transgressed a prohibition of marrying his brother's wife in the situation when this is forbidden, they have to separate, and bring a sacrifice. However, if they later find out that the child was not viable, the marriage can continue.

Yevamot 36 – Chalitzah with a pregnant widow

If one still goes ahead and performs a chalitzah, it is meaningless at this time.
<br />
<br />
However, if later she miscarries and it turns out that the brother did die childless after all – then now the chalitzah would be required. The question arises: does the previously performed chalitzah suffice? Rabbi Yochanan gives a general rule: a chalitzah of a pregnant woman is actually valid because now it transpires that she did need one. Likewise, a yibum performed with a pregnant woman also counts for the future. Why? Should Elijah the Prophet (who knows the future) come and reveal to us that she will miscarry, then the chalitzah would be valid – and therefore, it is valid even now. Alternatively - says Rabbi Yochanan - the proof is from the rule we had learned before, which states that "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/11/yevamot-35-widow-who-is-pregnant.html">the marriage can continue</a>." This means that the yibum with the pregnant woman is valid!
<br />
<br />
However, Resh Lakish disagrees on all counts and declares the chalitzah or yibum invalid. As far as Elijah and his knowledge of the future – Resh Lakish answers that right now, at least, we do not know the future and should judge accordingly, not using the logic of retroactively changing the meaning of current events based on the future outcomes. And as far as the rule of "the marriage can continue" – which seems to imply that the original yibum was valid – Resh Lakish will answer that it was not. Instead, a new yibum is required, and the marriage can continue.

However, the Sages asked to delay either for three months.</div><div>Here is why. Imagine that one marries the late brother's wife only two months after the brother dies. Imagine also that she gives birth seven months after this. Now we have two possibilities. It could be that this child is the full-term baby of the deceased. In this case, yibum was forbidden in the first place, they have transgressed and must bring a sacrifice, and he needs to divorce her because one cannot live with the wife of this brother who died but left a child.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if it is his child born after seven months of pregnancy (in the time of the Talmud, most babies were born after nine months, but a minority of healthy babies were born after seven months.) Now it transpires that he was correct in doing a yibum, and they can continue living together.
<br />
<br />
However, we cannot distinguish between the two cases: it may be a child of nine months, which means that the marriage is a transgression, or of seven months, in which case the wedding would be a mitzvah. Since they cannot resolve this uncertainty, he still must divorce her, and they bring the sacrifice prescribed for such doubts. But the child is not a mamzer in either case: either it is a child of the late brother or of the live one, and in both cases, it is legitimate.

How do they share in money?
<br />
<br />
For example, if she gets an inheritance from her father's family, she has full control over it, and can sell it or give it away, and her late husband's brothers cannot get it back. However, what happens if she dies? Since it is uncertain whether she is a wife or not, half of the property that constitutes her inheritance goes to her father's family, but the other half goes to the husband's brothers – that is the opinion of Beit Shammai. 
<br />
<br />
However, Beit Hillel uses a different method: in a case of doubt, the money remains in possession of that one who possesses it right now.<br />
<br />
For example, her Ketubah - money that she gets upon divorce or the husband's death - remains in possession of those who own it - the husband's heirs.<br />
<br />
Similarly, the property that she brought in and assessed at a certain sum, also called a dowry, remains in possession of the one who owns them. However, who possesses it? Our ruling does not say – and it is in itself a further disagreement: some say it is the husband's heirs, some – that it is the wife's heir, and yet others – that both sides possess it, so they would divide them. These and similar laws are discussed in more detail in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-158-house-collapsed-on.html" target="_blank">Talmud sections dealing with inheritance</a>.<br />

Here is what a man trying to find the permission to do so could argue.<p></p><p>He will marry his daughter off to his brother (the Torah law allows marriage with the niece.) Then, when his brother dies, he gets to marry his daughter as his brother's wife or a "yevamah." True, there is a prohibition against marrying one's daughter, but it is overwritten by a positive commandment to marry a yevamah.</p><p>His source? Two verses: "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=22#P5476" target="_blank">You should not wear wool and linen together</a>" and next to it, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=22#PP5477" target="_blank">You shall fringes on your garment</a>." For your fringes (tzitzit), you can use wool and linen together. In fact, that is what they did in the Temple, making the priests' belts. This teaches us that "do" overwrites "don't do."&nbsp;</p><p>He seems to have built his case? We answer that "do" overwrite "don't do" only for relatively light prohibitions, such as wearing wool and linen together. Marrying one's daughter - or any other similar ban - is more strict. So even the mitzvah of yibum does not help him turn the forbidden into permitted.</p><p>Art: Henri Rouart and his Daughter Helene by Edgar Degas</p><p><br /></p>

The Torah said, "... <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=17#P405">to be a God for you and your offspring after you</a>."&nbsp;We see that one of the requirements of the covenant is to clearly distinguish between the offspring of the first husband and the second one. The decree was extended to all cases of marriages and even betrothals, where childbearing should not be an issue – to prevent confusion.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: people won't be confused. So he allows, for example, a betrothed girl whose groom died to get married to another man right away. Similarly, a married woman can get engaged and wait three months for the chuppah. The exception is a betrothed girl in the province of Yehudah, where it was known that the grooms may have been too familiar with their brides.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose goes even further: there is no need to distinguish between the offspring of the first husband and the second one. Everybody can get married right away, except a widow, who needs to wait thirty days because of mourning obligation.

<br />
<br />
This ruling, however, raises many questions. The Torah, in describing yibum, said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5547">And the Sages of his city will summon him and speak to him</a>.” We understand that they give him appropriate advice. If he was old and she – young, they would tell him, “What do you have in common with such a young woman? Find somebody more appropriate for your age, and don't bring strife in your house.” They would say the same if the ages were reversed.<br />
<br />
Since most people will have difficulty supporting four wives, how do they let him do it in this case? – We must answer that we are dealing with a situation where he has the means. But if so, what is the novelty? It is obvious! – The ruling gives him good advice: he should not take more than four wives to fulfill the marital obligation with each one at least once a month.
<br />
<br />
If one re-marries his ex-wife, who married someone else in the interim, the child is a mamzer. That is only the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, but the Sages say that a mamzer is born only through a liaison with a married woman or a similar severe transgression. All agree, however, about another situation.&nbsp;If one divorced his wife and married any of her forbidden relatives, the child is indeed a mamzer. Regarding in-law relationships, a divorcée is like a wife.

As a result, the child is a mamzer. However, this is only one point of view.<br />
<br />
The opposite point of view is that a mamzer is only born from a union of a married Jewish woman and another Jewish man.

This disagreement persisted for centuries. Rav, who lived somewhat later, declared this child kosher. A man who was a Sage and whose father was an idolater said to Rav, “If such a child is kosher, give me your daughter in marriage.” Rav refused, but the man kept insisting. Finally, Rav set his gaze on him, and the man died. The law was established, and there was no counter-example to contest it.

All that is needed is for one to be circumcised. That was all that the Jews did in Egypt. The verse states, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0605.htm">For all the people that went forth from Egypt were circumcised</a>” – this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua says just the opposite: immersion in a mikvah is the only requirement since this is all that Jewish women did when they went out of Egypt. Obviously, they could not be circumcised, but how do we know they went to the mikvah? If not that, how were they brought into the Divine presence? But, since a woman can't be circumcised, how can we learn from that law for a man? Rabbi Yehoshua says that we indeed can.
<br />
<br />
However, the Sages maintain that both circumcision and immersion in a mikvah are required. What is their logic? – They agree both with Rabbi Yehoshua and with Rabbi Eliezer and thus come up with both requirements. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Safra tells a story how he was visiting Rabbi Chiya, with yet another Sage, and a convert came to them. He was circumcised but not immersed in a mikveh. Rabbi Chiya told him to wait until tomorrow morning, for then they would administer an immersion for him. We see three things from here: that both circumcision and immersion are required, that this immersion cannot be done at night, and that three people need to be present. Can we also derive that they all need to be Sages? – No, this is just how it happened.

<br />
<br />
Why is the man believed about himself? – Because anybody can create a prohibition with his own words in the situation where he stands to lose. But why is he not believed in his children? After all, a father is believed to tell us which of these sons is the firstborn!?  Once we believe him that he is an idolater, he is no longer qualified to testify on Jewish matters. Others say that the man believes even about his children, precisely because we would believe him about the firstborn, but he is not believed about his grandchildren.
<br />
<br />
In general, if one comes and says that he wishes to convert and become Jewish, they tell him that he is joining a persecuted and pursued people, and if he still persists, they begin the process right away. They also say to him about a few of the mitzvot that he will have to keep and inform him of the seriousness of the prohibitions of Shabbat and the like. However, they also tell him about rewards in the World to Come.  Finally, they inform him that he will have to give charity, and in Israel of the tithes that he will have to give. However, they don't overwhelm him with stringencies, as is learned from the behavior of Naomi toward Ruth, a righteous convert.

Yevamot 49 – How Manasseh killed Isaiah

What is his logic? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5495">A man shall not uncover the robe of his father</a>,” and it was talking about a woman with whom his father was intimate out of wedlock (mere “don't do it” for the son), and yet next is the phrase about a mamzer.<br />
<br />
However, Shimon Hatimni says that the transgression must be more severe, one that deserves death at the hands of Heaven, and this is the accepted opinion. Rabbi Yehoshua says that to produce a mamzer, the union must carry an even stronger prohibition that warrants death by court judgment.
<br />
<br />
There was an old scroll in Jerusalem which supported Rabbi Yehoshua. The scroll also told that Manasseh (an idolatrous king) killed the prophet Isaiah (who was his grandfather). Here is how it happened. First, Manasseh judged Isaiah as a false prophet. He said, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1006.htm">You claim to have seen God</a>, but Moses, your teacher said that one cannot see God and live.”"Manasseh found two more such contradictions. Isaiah had explanations for all of them but decided not to say them. He judged that Manasseh would not accept them but act in cold blood and preferred to keep him ignorant and erring. Instead, Isaiah said the unique name of God and was absorbed into a cedar tree. His tzitzit was visible, however, and the servants  of Manasseh began to chop the cedar. When they came to Isaiah's mouth, he died. Why did he deserve it? For the phrase that he said earlier, “I live among people of impure mouths.” One should not speak evil of the community of Israel.<br />

Yevamot 50 – Divorce, and then another divorce

Really, the Get has no place here; it should be either a yibum (marriage) or a chalitzah, which is akin to divorce. However, if he does give the first wife a Get, and the Get has no effect, then certainly the Get given to the second wife has no impact either, and he can marry the second wife's relatives (mother, sister, etc.)
<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, a Get does have the same effect as chalitzah, then all bonds between the remaining brother and the second wife are already dissolved, and giving her a Get now means nothing, for he is giving a Get to a stranger. This is the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, which can be expressed as “There is no Get after a Get.”
<br />
<br />
The Sages, however, say that “There is Get after a Get,” meaning that Get weakens the bond but does not dissolve it completely. Therefore, the first wife still needs a chalitzah, even after getting a Get. Also, the second wife is still connected to the brother, and if he gives her a Get, it is valid to the extent that he cannot marry her relatives, and she cannot marry his.
<br />
<br />
Why is this a partial situation? – This decree is to avoid confusion. If the Get had no validity, people could reason thus: “Get effects separation and chalitzah effect separation. Just as we see that the Get here has no effect, so too chalitzah has no effect other than allowing the woman to marry anyone outside the family,” and the people may then do a yibum, which is prohibited after chalitzah. This follows the rule that there is only one chance to re-build the brother's house, but not two.

Yevamot 52 – Get, Yibum, Chalitzah

If one declared the intent to marry his deceased brother's wife but then changed his mind and gave her a Get (divorce document), the Get alone is not enough. The Torah law dictates either a yibum or a chalitzah in this case. Therefore,&nbsp; he needs to also give her a chalitzah.
<br />
<br />
If one stated that he would marry the widow (this is called "maamar" and looks like an engagement) and then cohabited with her – this is the proper way of doing the mitzvah of yibum. Now, that's obvious, isn't it? You might think that since this procedure looks completely like marriage, people may think it is actually a traditional marriage and not a yibum. Therefore, we need to be told that this is the proper order and that people will understand. Note that in practice today, yibum is never done, but rather one performs the chalitzah.
<br />
<br />
Moreover, one who did not follow the laws of propriety was subject to lashes given by the court. For example, Rav used to order lashes to one who cohabited with his deceased brother's wife without first declaring marriage intent. He also prescribed lashes for one who betroths a woman by cohabitation. Even though cohabitation is the only form of engagement mentioned in the Torah, the Sages decreed additional, preferred forms: money (ring) or a document. Some say Rav only gave lashes in this last case because it is licentious behavior.

Yevamot 54 – Erection is a state of mind

Whether done willingly for a mitzvah or by coercion or by mistake, whether he only begins the act or completes it, and whether it is natural or anal intercourse – it makes no difference, and he acquires her as a wife.
<br />
<br />
How can a man be coerced? Could it be that idolaters forced him? – No, this explanation won't stand: since his member was erect, it must be that he found the situation somewhat desirable and was, therefore, a willing participant. (This rule is called “Erection is a state of mind.”) Can we suggest that he was sleeping? – No, for then he lacks the intelligence to affect the legal acquisition. Can we then suggest he was on a roof with an erection for his wife, fell off the roof, and accidentally inserted it into his yevamah? – That too does not stand: he may be liable for damages, such as pain and medical bills, but he does not create a yibum. Final conclusion: he had an erection for his wife, and then the brother's wife seized him and cohabited with him.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, if a man intends to insert his member into a wall and accidentally inserts it in his yevamah, he has not acquired her as a wife since his intention was not for cohabitation; however, if he intended to insert it into an animal, and inserted it into his yevamah, he has acquired her, because an act with an animal is considered a form of cohabitation.

Yevamot 56 – What is legally considered an act of cohabitation?

The same applies to being liable for cohabitation with any woman who is prohibited to him. But what is considered the beginning of cohabitation?
<br />
<br />
Shmuel says this is the contact (literally, "kiss") of the genitals. He brings an analogy: imagine a man who places his finger on his mouth; it is impossible not to push the flesh of his lips. In other words, Shmuel agrees that a minimal degree of penetration is required, but he argues that it is inevitably achieved by contact. 
<br />
<br />
However, in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, they brought another opinion: insertion of the corona constitutes the beginning of cohabitation, with all the legal consequences. What is then considered the completion of the act? – Insertion of the part of the member beyond the corona. What about the emission of seed? – Many say that it is legally not required. What about the "emission of seed" mentioned by the Torah? – they say that the situation should be fit to emit it, but not really do it.
<br />
<br />
And for what things does he acquire his yevama? – If he is a Kohen, she can already eat Kohen's portion (terumah), which is ordinarily permitted only to Kohen's family. He inherits his brother. He can annul her vows and bury her – which is ordinarily prohibited to a Kohen for anybody but his close relatives.

However, what happens when they do the chuppah without prior engagement and when they really should not get married, such as when a High Priest is marrying a widow. After this forbidden marriage, she would lose the privileges of a Kohen's daughter (if she had them). Rav says: this chuppah is not legally significant since there is a possibility that they will realize the wrongdoing and stop themselves. However, Shmuel says that the chuppah is too close to the transgression, and she has lost the privileges already.
<br />
<br />
Rav Sheshet elucidated this disagreement from a seemingly unrelated ruling about a suspected wife. When she says, “Amen, amen,” she tells the truth now and has never lied in other situations. But what different situation could the rule mean? After a few trials, we suggest that she was engaged, then hid with another man, then had a chuppah with the first one. But that is similar to our situation: he is forbidden to live with her until the case is cleared, and they had a chuppah but did not live together. It could have been a brilliant resolution, but the Talmud asserts that the ruling itself is transmitted incorrectly and cannot serve as any proof. The question remains unresolved.

The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=21#P3356">He will take a wife in her virginity</a>.” This is to emphasize initial virginity, at the age between twelve to twelve-and-half. However, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon allow him to marry a girl older that that.
<br />
<br />
What is their respective logic? The first teacher (Rabbi Meir) interprets “her virginity” to strictly emphasize this initial maturity. However, the extra word “in” relaxes the law and tells us that only natural cohabitation makes her ineligible for the High Priest, but unnatural (anal) does not disqualify her.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon understand “virginity” as already denoting complete virginity. Then the next word “her virginity” relaxes the law and allows more mature age. Therefore, the third word, “in,” again makes the law stricter and requires all her virginity to be extant, excluding unnatural (anal) intercourse, which accordingly disqualifies her.
<br />
<br />
Today, when there is no  Temple and no High Priest, this discussion is largely theoretical.
<br />

Yevamot 61 – Whom the High Priest can marry

However, Rabbi Shimon, who usually understands and ascribes reasons for the laws of the Torah, says that the logic here is that a convert may have had relations with someone prohibited to her. Therefore, if a  girl converts  before the age of three, her cohabitation - even if she is violated - does not carry the disqualification power of an adult, and she can marry a Kohen.
<br />
<br />
Another lenient law from Rabbi Shimon: an idolater's grave does not spread ritual impurity under a roof, so that a person in this situation remains pure. Why? – The Torah said, “Man (Adam), when he dies under a roof...transmits impurity.” And only Jews are called “Adam,” because their souls all come from reincarnations of Adam's soul – which is not true for idolaters. 
<br />
<br />
If a Kohen betrothed a widow (whom he is allowed to marry) and was appointed a High Priest, he could fully marry her (which would not be allowed for a regular High Priest). This is learned from the words “... only a virgin shall he take,” where the words “shall he take” are extra, alluding to a particular case where he marries a widow.
<br />
<br />
This situation happened with Yehoshua ben Gamla, who betrothed a widow, Martha, daughter of Baitos, who was then appointed High Priest but proceeded with marriage. In fact, Martha was influential in his appointment: she bought High Priest's place for her husband with many, many pounds of gold coins. But in the end, Yehoshua restored Torah study and is remembered for good, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/09/bava-batra-21-restrictions-on.html" target="_blank">as we have learned elsewhere</a>.

How many children are sufficient? – Two sons – these are the words of Beit Shammai. What is their logic? Moses had two sons, and after that, he abstained from having relations with his wife. However, Beit Hillel says that a man must have a son and a daughter. Why? – Just like God created a male and a female, so is this mitzvah. Incidentally, all agree that it is not proper for a man to be without a wife, even if he has fulfilled the obligation to be fruitful, because the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=2#P49">It's not good for a man to be alone</a>."<br />
<br />
Why don't Beit Shammai learn from the world's creation, just as Beit Hillel does? – They answer that there it was impossible to do otherwise: Eve had to be created so that Adam could have a wife; however, in our context, if a man has two sons, there are many women in the world that they can marry.
<br />
<br />
Then why don't Beit Hillel learn from the life of Moses, as Beit Shammai does? – They answer that Moses' situation was unique, and he separated from his wife of the accord. What was his logic? He reasoned thus: if the children of Israel, with whom God spoke only one time while giving the Torah, had to stay away from their wives, then I (Moses), with whom God speaks at all times, how much more so I have to stay away from my wife? – and God later agreed with him, saying, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=5#P5078">Tell them to go back to their houses (wives)</a>," which we understand to imply, "But you are correct in staying here with Me."<br />
<br />
Actually, there were three cases where Moses did things on his own accord, and God later agreed. Another one was breaking the Tablets. Moses reasoned: if the Passover offerings – which is only one commandment in the Torah – are forbidden to one who is “estranged” from the Torah, then the whole Torah is, of course, forbidden to the Jews who worship a Golden Calf. God later agreed, saying, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2495">Tablets, which you broke</a>." The word "which," "asher," can be understood as "yasher koach" – correct that you did it.

A few teachings of Rabbi Elazar about a man and his wife: one who does not have a wife is not a whole man because "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=5#P108">God created them male and female, and called their name Man</a>;" a wife is called "helper against him" – if he deserves, she is a helper, if not – she is against him; "God brought her to Adam, and Adam said, "this time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh" teaches that Adam has approached every animal, but his mind was pacified only with Eve.
<br />
<br />
As Rav was leaving Rabbi Chiya, Rabbi Chiya asked him, "What is worse than death?" Rav searched for the answer and found it, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3107.htm">I found – bitter than death – a bad wife</a>." Rabbi Chiya intended to save Rav from a bad wife, but his prayer was unsuccessful, and Rav's wife used to aggravate him, cooking the opposite of what he asked. Rav's son, Chiya, started reversing Rav's requests so that when the wife cooked a different dish, Rav would get precisely what he wanted. Rav said, "Your mother has improved her ways!" Chiya confessed that he was reversing orders. Rav said, "I could have learned from you! And yet, it is not good to say a lie."
<br />
<br />
A teaching of Ben Sira: "A beautiful wife – happy is her husband, the number of his days is doubled."
<br />
<br />
The Messiah will only come when all the souls initially present in Adam will have a chance to be born. Accordingly, one who does not engage in procreation is considered as spilling blood and diminishing God's image.

Yevamot 64 – Ten years without children

This is only true if he did not have children before. It also assumes that they don't know who is at fault. However, if the man is sterile, there is no point in him divorcing her since he cannot have children with anybody else anyway. After he divorces her, she has no presumption of not being able to have children, and when she marries another man, the new husband needs to also count ten years before applying the rule above.
<br />
<br />
In deciding whether she gets the payment of Ketubah, the question of whose fault it was coming up again. Here the blame is assigned to the man: since the mitzvah of procreation is on him, it is assumed that not being to have children is his fault – in the absence of any other indicators – and therefore, she, not being at fault, is entitled to full payment of her Ketubah.

Yevamot 65 – Claiming a refund

If that happens the second time, then on the third time, the presumption changes, and, since three times is considered an established rule, she is established as not being able to have children. The third husband can divorce her without a Ketubah payment.  Can the previous husband now claim a refund of his earlier Ketubah payment? No, for she can claim, “It is only now that I have grown weak, but it was your fault before.”
<br />
<br />
If she was then married the fourth time and had children, can she claim the Ketubah from the third husband? – Here, we apply the rule, “Your silence is better than your speech.” He can counterclaim and say, “Had I known that you were fertile, I would never divorce you. So it was not a divorce, and you are still married to me, and your new children are mamzerim.” However, the court can say, “Even if she is silent if that is the truth, then we must act!” Instead, the correct claim is that it is only now that she became healthy and fertile, but at the time of divorce, she was unable to conceive, and therefore the third husband is not liable to pay.
<br />
<br />
We implied that it is the man's obligation to procreate. Why? The Torah said, “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and conquer it,” talking to men who, in general, engage in battles and conquer. Another opinion is that both men and women have this mitzvah because the word “Be fruitful (p'ru)” is plural imperative. What does the first one answer? The term “conquer” is missing a letter “u” in the way it is written and can be read in the singular.

Yevamot 70 – An uncircumcised Kohen

This is also true for slaves that he acquires. However, if this Kohen is uncircumcised or ritually impure, he cannot eat terumah. This does not change his family's status, and they can continue to eat terumah just as they did before - because they are still his family and did not change in any way.<br />
<br />
When a Kohen is uncircumcised, we are not talking about a willful violator because the Talmud usually does not speak about violators. Instead, his two older brothers have previously died due to circumcision, which left him with the presumption that circumcision is dangerous to his health and should not be done. Still, when he becomes healthy, and experts assess this, the mitzvah of circumcision is again incumbent on him.<br />
<br />
The situation is reversed for a Kohen who has wounded or crushed testicles or whose member is severed. He is prohibited from marrying and cohabiting with a Jewish woman, but this does not take away his status as a Kohen. Therefore, he may still eat terumah. However, his wife is different: once he cohabits with her, she loses the right to terumah because she had cohabitation with someone unfit for her.<br />

Yevamot 76 – The congregation of Israel

However, he can marry a convert. Although converts are Jewish in every respect, they are not encompassed by the term "congregation." Their children, however, will be called "congregation."
<br />
<br />Rabbi Yehudah has another view, according to which converts are also included in the "congregation," and accordingly, our man discussed above cannot marry anyone. The source for this law is found in the Torah <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5496" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br />
<br />
Similarly, a convert from the people of Amon or Moav <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5498" target="_blank">is prohibited from marrying into the congregation.</a> This was only true when these peoples lived as separate nations. After king Sennacherib expanded his empire and resettled entire peoples, they all got mixed, and the law stopped being applicable. Even when relevant, only male converts had the prohibition, but not females, since the Torah formulated the ban in terms of "Moavi" - which implies the male, but not "Moaviyah," which would indicate a woman.

This had direct relevance to King David's provenance.
<br />
<br />
When Shaul offered his armor to David to fight Goliath, he noticed how it miraculously shrank to fit David's size. He then ordered Avner to ask who David's father was. But everyone knew David's father because he had six hundred thousand people (students) at his command! Instead, he was asking if David was from Peretz, fit to be a king, or from Zerach – just a noble.
<br />
<br />
Here Doeg intervened and said that they should rather inquire about David's legitimacy altogether, for he came from Ruth, the princess of the people of Moav. Avner defended David: only male converts from Amon have a problem. Doeg countered: then only a male mamzer has a problem, but not female! They kept analyzing the reasons, but Doeg, who was very smart, cornered Avner, who then went to a central yeshiva for support. There, too, Doeg was victorious with his logic. 
<br />
<br />
At this point, Yeter intervened. He girded himself with a sword and said that whoever does not accept the law of female converts from Moav being legitimate would be killed with this sword. However, he also added that he has heard this law from Shmuel the Prophet. He was believed. But why? Wasn't he in the heat of the argument and therefore suspect of lying? – Because Shmuel and his court were alive, and this rule could have been easily verified.

What if she happens to also be his wife's sister? That is, what if two brothers were married to two sisters, and one brother died. Usually, we would say that a man <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=18#P3267">can't marry his wife's sister while his wife is alive</a>. However, perhaps here, since one prohibition is lifted and he has to marry the widow, he can do so even though he will be married to sisters?
<br />
<br />
Where would we see that "once a prohibition is lifted, other prohibitions are lifted as well?" – In the laws of a metzora (spiritual leper). Usually, a metzora is not allowed to visit the Temple. However, to purify himself, he needs to. And, once he is on the way to do so, he is allowed to disregard other kinds of impurity, such as last night's seminal emission. Should we apply this principle and permit one to marry any close relative if she happens to be in the "yibum" situation with him? – No! To prevent such a possible way of thinking, the Torah added extra words, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=18#P3267">to her</a>" – to teach that the wife's sister is prohibited even in the situation of yibum.
<br />
<br />
Even though the principle of "once a prohibition is lifted, other prohibitions are lifted as well" does not apply here because of the extra words "to her" and also because of other ways of how this prohibition can be derived, it nevertheless finds applications in other areas.

Yevamot 81 – A sterile Kohen

By contrast, if he is sterile because of physical damage to his reproductive organs, he is prohibited from marrying into the congregation of Israel. Therefore, if he was previously married, he now needs to divorce, and if, in the interim, he has a cohabitation with his wife, she would lose the right to eat the priest's portion – even if she had it because she was a daughter of a Kohen.
<br />
<br />
A Kohen who is an androgyne can marry a woman, and that marriage entitles her to eat the priest's portion. That is because an androgyne is classified as a definite male – this is the opinion of Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon. However, they did not clarify if they were entirely sure of a "definite male" designation or if it was an "also a definite male." Accordingly, this leads to a disagreement about whether the priest's portion law is active nowadays or is it only a law that the Sages left as a reminder for the future when the priest's portion will return.

Yevamot 82 – Things that are always counted

Rabbi Yochanan says that this designation of him as a male is definite, because otherwise he would not be giving his wife the right to eat the priest's portion, for which a regular person is liable to death by the hand of Heaven. This logic is valid, because the laws of priest's portion (terumah) are valid even today, when there is diaspora. 
<br />
<br />
However, Resh Lakish disagrees about precisely this point: the priest's portion is just a reminder that the Sages have established for the future time, when it will be reinstated, at the in-gathering of the exiles. Then how is the wife of an androgynous Kohen allowed to eat terumah? – Because the terumah itself is only a decree of the Sages. As part of their enactment, they allowed her to eat terumah. Resh Lakish then regards the designation of an androgyne as a male as only a possibility.
<br />
<br />
This disagreement is rooted in another, about the wording in the "things that are counted" rule. What is this rule? Some versions say that "all things that are counted" are included in the laws of nullification – that is, things that are sometimes counted and sometimes weighted, like a sliver of meat. Other versions insist on "only things that are counted," including only such things as cabbage stalks. In Israel, they grew as big as small trees and were always counted, never weighed. This disagreement is the root of the laws of nullification of terumah and for the controversies listed above.

Yevamot 83 – The laws of Rabbi Yose
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Rabbi Yose did not say much, but when he did, the law usually followed him. Rav mentioned two such cases: androgyne and grafting, and Shmuel mentioned another two: a woman in labor and rendering unfit. Let's look at some of them.
<br />
<br />
Earlier, we saw that an androgyne has the status of a male for the purpose of another male marrying him – the disagreement was whether one is liable for relations with him only through his male orifice (anus) or also his female orifice. However, Rabbi Yose states that an androgyne is considered a separate creature, and the Sages were not sure whether to give him the status of a male. As a result, none of the laws requiring definite proof of him being a male can be applied.
<br />
<br />
Grafting: one may not plant a tree or graft a branch to a tree on a Shmita year, and even some time before it. Rabbi Yose said that this “some time” was two weeks, and another period of thirty days was already implied, so that total according to him was thirty days and two weeks. 
<br />
<br />
Rendering unfit: one should not plant wheat in a vineyard, so if one spreads his vines over someone else's grain, he has created a prohibition, and the crop from the overhanging must be burned. One who does it is liable to compensate the owner. However, Rabbi Yose (together with Rabbi Shimon) says that one cannot prohibit something that does not belong to him. Thus, no prohibition is created, and there is no need to burn and repay.

Yevamot 84 – All possible cases of yibum

How?<br />
<br />
For example, consider if a woman was a widow and a regular Kohen married her, but his brother was a High Priest. The brother would not be allowed to do a yibum – since a High Priest should not marry a widow – and thus, she is permitted to her husband but not to the yavam.
<br />
<br />
A non-trivial example of the second category is this. A regular Israel married an illegitimate woman (mamzeret). He has a brother who is himself a mamzer. An ordinary Israel cannot marry a mamzeret, but a mamzer can. Thus, we have a case of a woman who is forbidden to her husband but is permitted to her yavam.
<br />
<br />
A new example: a High Priest married a widow. This was a prohibited marriage, so the woman became disqualified (chalalah). Now she cannot marry any Kohen, not because she is a widow, but because she is a chalalah. This is a situation where she is forbidden both to her husband and her yavam.
<br />
<br />
The fourth category includes all other combinations, even though the Talmud finds cases that are not listed in the first three categories and do not belong to the fourth, which means that the examples lists are not exhaustive.<br />

What is his logic? – The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4281">Speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take … tithe.</a>'"<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that the tithe goes to the Kohanim. How could he exclude the Levites altogether? – He didn't; he meant "Also to the Kohanim." And what is his logic? – There are twenty-four places where the Kohanim are called Levites because they, in fact, come from the same family: Aaron, the progenitor of all the Kohanim, comes from the tribe of Levy.
<br />
<br />
If so, how can Rabbi Akiva argue that the tithe should not be given to the Kohanim? – He says that the tithe is unique because one can eat it "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4286,">anywhere</a>," whereas the Kohen cannot eat it in a cemetery – because he cannot go to the cemetery at all! What would Rabbi Elazar answer now? – He says this teaches a different law, namely, that the tithe can be eaten in any state, even being ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
Later, when the Second Temple was being built, the Sages penalized the Levites, took the tithe away from them, and gave it to the Kohanim – because the Levites did not come back to build the Temple; some say it was done for the benefit of poor Kohanim.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah had a garden from which he collected the tithe. Rabbi Akiva turned the garden's entrance into a cemetery so that Rabbi Elazar (who was a Kohen) would be prevented from taking the tithe. Rabbi Elazar said, "Akiva is with his shepherd's sack, but I will survive anyway." (He was very wealthy).

Let's look at the possible metamorphoses that she can later go through.
<br />
<br />
If her husband the Kohen dies, but she has a child from him, she can continue to eat terumah, as if her husband was still alive. If she then marries a Levi, she may eat Levi's due from the crop – that is, first tithe (“maasar”) but she can't eat terumah any longer. 
<br />
<br />
Here was can note that the author of this ruling is Rabbi Meir, who forbids the first tithe to a non-Levi. 
<br />
<br />
If her husband the Levi dies but she has a child from him, she can still eat maaser. If then she marries a regular Israel, she may not eat either maaser or terumah. If her husband the Israel dies but she has a child from him, she still cannot eat either maaser or terumah. 
<br />
<br />
If her son from Israel dies, she can again eat maaser because of her son, a Levi. If her son from a Levi dies, she can now eat terumah because of her son, who is a Kohen. And if that son dies, she again cannot eat either maaser or terumah.

Subsequently, a man came back and told her that her husband had died and that he had witnessed this. If he is willing to testify in court, then ordinarily, this is not sufficient for her to remarry because the rule is that there must be two witnesses to establish any event.
<br />
<br />
However, since often there won't be two witnesses, the Sages have established a new rule: that one witness is sufficient in this situation and that after the court questions him and issues a ruling permitting her to remarry, she can do so.
<br />
<br />
This is based on the assumption that the woman does not take the matter lightly, but will rather investigate on her own. And yet, in abrogating the law of two witnesses, she is taking the matter into her own hands. If it later happens that the husband was really alive, and he comes back, then she – due to her lack of sufficient investigation – will face a penalty: she will have to leave her new husband (to whom she was never legally married, as it turns out, because she was still married to the first one), and she will also have to be divorced from the first husband, all as a deterrent.

Yevamot 89 – The logic of the divorce

What is the logic?
<br />
<br />
We understand that she needs a Get from the first husband, since, as is turned out, she is still married to him. But the second one – technically their betrothal did not even take effect! – This was instituted by the Sages to prevent a mistake: the onlookers might think she was properly married to the second husband, and now leaves him without a Get – and therefore conclude that the Get is generally unnecessary. 
<br />
<br />
But take a similar case where she only got engaged, not married to the second husband – there she can return to the first husband, and the Get from the second one is not required. Why not!? – People might also make a mistake and think that one can remarry his wife after she was divorced and married to someone in the interim. That, actually, is a reasonable objection. However, the fine distinction is that where she was only engaged – no transgression took place – and although people might make a mistake, the Sages did not penalize her; where she got married, they lived together unlawfully, and they did impose a penalty.
<br />
<br />
Moreover, any child she has from one of the two husbands is considered illegitimate (mamzer). Again, we understand this about the second husband, but the first? – The Talmud then discussed if the Sages really have the power to declare a kosher child a mamzer as a penalty.

Levi asked Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html">Why did the central rule of Yevamot</a>" teach only fifteen cases? It should teach sixteen!" Rabbi Yehudah replied, "It seems like this one has no brains in his head!" But what sixteenth woman could Levy have meant? The Talmud suggests that it may be a daughter of a man who violated a woman and whom his son married – but discards the idea since this case is actually a disagreement, and the rule of fifteen was unanimous. It also suggests many other, much more complicated relationships but discards them all and explains why Rabbi Yehudah would not agree to any such scenario as a sixteenth case.
<br />
<br />
Also, the phrase "this one has no brains in his head" implies that the answer should be obvious and that Levy should have deduced the answer independently. Thus, the phrase itself carries additional information, and the Talmud discussed what it might be.<br />

Yevamot 90 – Can the Sages change the Torah?

On the previous page, we saw a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/01/yevamot-89-logic-of-divorce.html">situation where the Sages declared a woman's child a mamzer</a>. How can this be done? Not only it is a punishment, for he now cannot marry a regular Jewish woman, but that perhaps even means that as a mamzer, he can marry a woman who is a mamzer. If in truth, he is kosher, and only the Sages declared him a mamzer as a penalty, then by this punishment, they allowed him to transgress the law of the Torah. If that is so, the Sages would be allowed to change the law for policy reasons. Is that possible?
<br />
<br />
Consider all the situations where the Sages take away a person's property as a penalty. Are they changing the property laws of the Torah? – No, since <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35a10.htm">the Torah itself gave the Court the authority to declare someone's property ownerless</a>.<br />
<br />
Another situation: the shofar is not blown on Shabbat of Rosh Hashanah. Did the Sages change the Torah here? – Not really, they told not to do something (literally, to sit and do nothing), and this is different from actively transgressing. 
<br />
<br />
Yet another attempt: if a husband gives a Get to his wife but then annuls it, the annulment is valid – even though this creates terrible consequences for his divorcee, who may not be aware of it. Rabbi Shimon says that the annulment is not good - due to the power of the Court. So to strengthen the ability of the Court, the Sages changed the Torah law and permitted a married woman to another man? Not true either, since every marriage contract has the phrase "with the agreement of the Sages," and if they later disagree, they annul the marriage retroactively so that the Get is not even needed. But tell me, this is where there was a marriage contract. What if one performed engagement by cohabitation – which <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/10/kiddushin-2-ways-to-acquire-woman.html" target="_blank">is valid</a>?! – Here the Sages changed the meaning of his cohabitation from engagement to pure pleasure. 
<br />
<br />
The conclusion is that the Sages cannot change the Torah.

Yevamot 97 – Riddles

The prohibition of marrying the wife of one's father does not apply here. Rabbi Yehudah forbids the son to marry such a woman. The <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23" target="_blank">verse </a>talks only about a legal wife, but Rabbi Yehudah derives his additional prohibition from the context. Even the first teacher will agree that the Sages later prohibited such marriage.
<br />
<br />
Now a few riddles. Who can say about a man that he is "my paternal brother but not a maternal one, he is my mother's husband, and I am his wife's daughter?" This can happen legally following the first teacher, but not Rabbi Yehudah. A man (Jacob) violated a woman and had a daughter with her. Reuven (Jacob's son from another woman) married the woman whom his father violated. Reuven's daughter can say that Reuven, her paternal brother, married her mother.
<br />
<br />
Another one. A woman says: he is my brother, and he is my son. I am the sister of this child of mine whom I carry on my shoulders. Answer: a man had relations with his daughter and fathered a son with her. The child is at once her son and her paternal brother.
<br />
<br />
Yet another one: a woman says, “Peace to you, my son; I am your sister's daughter.” Answer: one had relations with his daughter's daughter and fathered a son. She is at once the child's mother and its paternal sister's daughter. 
<br />
<br />
Why do we need such riddles? Some say – to sharpen the minds of the Torah scholars, while others – that Queen Sheba posed these riddles to King Solomon to test his wisdom.

One reason for it is that the Jews did not go up en masse to the Land of Israel – this is the opinion of Resh Lakish. However, Rabbi Yochanan disagrees and says that even if they had gone, it would not help – based on the phrase “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=9#P233">God will beautify Greece, but His Presence will be with the sons of Shem</a>.” &nbsp;Although the Persians, who are considered the descendants of Greece, built a beautiful Temple, God's presence still dwelt only in the First Temple, which was built wholly by the Jews. The Talmud then discussed the fates of the states and nations based on their role in the building or destruction of the Temple. 
<br />
<br />
Did the chamber in which the High Priest lived for seven days before Yom Kippur have a mezuzah? Some say that a mezuzah was required there only for those seven days, but they still kept it throughout the year, lest they forget to put it on, or lest the people say that the High Priest is locked in a prison. Others say even those seven days are a disagreement: even though the High Priest did not choose to live there but was forced to, it is still considered a valid dwelling that needs a mezuzah – so say the Sages. In contrast, Rabbi Yehudah says that it was not considered a proper dwelling, and the mezuzah was not required. All agree, though, that practically it still was there.

However, just as a house, it should be inhabited. For example, strictly speaking, a synagogue requires a mezuzah only if the sexton (gabbai) lives there.
<br />
<br />
Would a storehouse require a mezuzah? Some say that they do not require a mezuzah because it is not “your house” but an animal’s. Others say that it is “your house,” that is, a house belonging to you, and thus requiring a mezuzah. All agree that a bathhouse does not need one.<br />
<br />
What about such a gate that is straight at the bottom but oval at the top? Rabbi Meir says that it still needs a mezuzah, while the Sages say that it does not. What is the point of contention between them? Rabbi Meir applies the principle of “we view it as if straightened out,” that is, if we were to remove the extra material at the arch and make the doorposts go straight, wouldn't it require a mezuzah? - so even now, it does. But the Sages disagree with the principle of “we view it as if straightened out.”

Yoma 12 – Another High Priest

This could be due to a seminal emission on the night of Yom Kippur or to some other ritual impurity. In that case, the designated Kohen would become a High Priest and perform the service.
<br />
<br />
However, how is this possible? Normally, a Kohen becomes a High Priest by either being anointed with special oil or by donning the eight garments of the High Priest, with the appearance of gold, and additional items such as a breastplate and tzitz. The third way to be consecrated for High Priest's work would be to perform a service specific to him. In sum, he should do something special that only a High Priest can do.
<br />
<br />
In the Second Temple, there was no anointing oil. After the first morning sacrifice, the High Priest would take off his “golden” garments and dress in pure white linen and become indistinguishable from a regular Kohen in the Temple. Thus, if a disqualification were to occur now, there seems to be no way to consecrate the standby Kohen. Rav Adda said, “His belt is different, since it is of pure white linen, while that of a regular Kohen is of colored wool together with linen.” This advice only works if the belt of a regular Kohen is indeed different, but there are varying opinions on that. Abaye suggested, “Let him dress up in golden garments and turn some parts of a burning sacrifice – which is also a special service!” Rav Pappa said, “Any service that he does makes him the High Priest because only a High Priest can perform service on that day.” The last advice seemed like a loophole, but Rav Pappa found a precedent that served as proof.

Yoma 13 – Another wife for the High Priest

Since the Torah said, “He will atone for himself and his house (euphemism for wife)” - he must have one – this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The Sages, however, say that if so, they would have to prepare another wife, and another wife, and so on, to no end – therefore, conclude the Sages, they don't prepare a second wife for him.
<br />
<br />
The second wife, however, leads to some complications. First, he is not married to her. The Talmud suggests that he should marry her. But then he has two wives, and the Torah said to atone “for his house,” not “for his houses.” Then he should divorce her! - If so, he has no substitute wife! Rather, what we mean is that he should divorce her conditionally: if she does not die before the end of Yom Kippur, the divorce takes effect retroactively from the time it was given. Thus, if she does not die, it transpires that he only had one wife, and if his present wife dies, he has a substitute. But what if she does not die (the divorce takes effect), and his present wife does die, and he is left without any wife during Yom Kippur!
<br />
<br />
After considering a few more conditional divorces, the Talmud decides to make it dependent on her action (if she goes into a synagogue, she is divorced) and then on his action. Finally: he divorces both wives conditionally: to one, he says, “This is your divorce (Get) on the condition that your fellow wife does not die,” and to the other - “This is your Get on the condition that I enter a synagogue.”&nbsp;<br />

However, on Yom Kippur, he will be performing them all by himself, so for the seven days of sequestration, he practices these services daily: he throws the blood of the sacrifices, burns the incense, prepares the lamps, and offers the head and the hind leg of the daily offering.
<br />
<br />
Whoever wrote down this ruling, it was not Rabbi Akiva. Why not? Because it would contradict his other ruling: for all seven days, they would sprinkle the High Priest with the ashes of the Red Heifer to remove any possible impurity of the dead he might have contracted. According to Rabbi Akiva, this sprinkling has an amazing property: it purifies only the impure ones, but if someone is pure in the first place, then the ashes make him impure until the end of the day. Thus, according to Rabbi Akiva, the High Priest would be impure every day and unable to perform any service.
<br />
<br />
From where does Rabbi Akiva derive this most strange fact? – From the words of the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=19#P4306">And the pure will sprinkle upon the impure</a>.” The Torah could have said “upon him,” why did it have to again emphasize that he was impure? – To tell us that the impure becomes pure, but the pure becomes impure. The Sages say that it would be totally illogical, and as far as the words “on the impure” – they learn a different law from it. But how does Rabbi Akiva answer the logic argument? He says, “Even Solomon could not understand it, as he said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3107.htm">I wanted to become wise, but it is beyond me</a>.”<br />

If so, we have a problem: the order of the&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/meilah-30-temple-morning-tamid.html">Tractate “Tamid” service, which is specifically dedicated to Temple procedure</a>, is listed differently: first the Menorah and then the incense.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan explains that the two are written by different authors and that Rabbi Shimon HaMitzpah is the author of Yoma. Every teacher of the earlier times (before 200 C.E) is entitled to his opinion on the basic facts, and if they differ - we have two aspects of truth, only we don’t know how to reconcile them.
<br />
<br />
But even within one Tractate, Yoma, we also have a contradiction! We will later learn that the lots by which it was decided which Kohen gets which service also go in the order of menorah - then incense. Abaye explains that too: cleaning the seven branches of the Menorah was done in two steps: first the five branches, and then the remaining two. The incense was brought in between these two steps. Thus we see that the order could indeed be described differently, and depending on which part of the services you are talking about, the cleaning of the Menorah could occur before the incense or after it. The key Torah phrase here is “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=30#P2387">when he prepares the lamps, he shall bring the incense</a>.” This phrase is explained differently by Abba Shaul and the Sages. The Talmud continues to point out and reconcile contradictions in the order of the service.

This is required by the Torah, and we understand from here that he had to actually see the entrance. This was only possible if the eastern wall of the Temple was somewhat lower than the other walls. The Talmud is interested in whose opinion this is. It answers that it could only be Rabbi Elazar ben Yakov since only according to him, that wall’s foundation was high enough for the problem of visibility to arise.
<br />
<br />
But perhaps this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, since, according to him, the gates' geometry would allow this direct view? - No, it could not be him, because according to Rabbi Yehudah, the Altar was exactly in the middle of the Courtyard and would obstruct the view. Thus, by combining the limitations imposed by the rules of burning the Red Heifer and the Altar position, the Talmud finds who was the author of the rulings we are learning here in Yoma and in the Tractate Midot, which concerns the exact sizes of everything in the Temple.

Yoma 17 – The right-of-way for the High Priest

In that case, he has the right to say, “I will offer this burnt offering,” or “I will offer this flour offering,” or “I will eat this sin-offering,” and so on.
<br />
<br />
For more special offerings, he is entitled to a portion of it. For example, he can have one lamb of the two brought on Shavuot. The special “Bread of Vision,” which induced mystical visions, was distributed among the Kohanim on every Shabbat. Of these twelve loaves of bread, he takes four or five. Now, this division is not logical. In the first case, he was entitled to exactly half, and in the second – to less than half. Also, what does “four or five” mean?
<br />
<br />
However, in this rule, we have a mixture of different opinions. First, one says that the High Priest can have up to half of the total - based on the Torah's phrase, “To Aaron and his sons,” which is understood as “half to Aaron and half to his sons.” Another opinion is that he takes less than half – that is the “four or five” out of twelve. However, it could also be that all agree that he takes less than half; as far as one loaf on Shavuot – it would not be polite to break it. There is also an opinion that two of the twelve loaves of bread of vision are given as a reward for the closing of the gates, and the remaining ten are divided between the rest – this explains the “four” as less than half of ten.

Then they would say, “Master High Priest, please read it back to us, for perhaps you forgot or never learned." How could it be that he never learned? – In the times of the Second Temple, the position was bought for money.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>On the last day, they would show him all the animals to be used for sacrifices, except for the goat brought as a sin offering for all Jews – lest he becomes despondent thinking of it.
<br />
<br />
On the last day, they also did not give him much food, for food leads to sleep, and too much of it might cause him to becomes ritually impure through seminal emission. They also did not feed such foods as etrog, eggs, fat meat, and wine – for the same reason.
<br />
<br />
In general, a guest should take precautions not to soil the linen he sleeps on, or the host's garments, if he wears them – lest they see it and think less of him. The Sages were very careful to maintain this sort of purity, and for this, they would announce, “Who will be a wife for a day for me?” when they were visiting a remote location.
<br />
<br />
This, however, leads to many questions. How could they marry wives in many places – what if their children, not knowing each other, will intermarry? – Those Sages were famous, and their progeny would know where they came from. Another problem: a prospective wife needs to go to a mikveh seven days in advance, so how can they choose anybody on the spot? – The answer is that they would send a messenger to announce their intent a week in advance. Alternatively, we can say that they only secluded with the woman of their choice but did not have relations, thus obviating all of the above questions. But if that is so, how did it help? – One who potentially has a wife (“a bread in his basket”) cannot be compared to one who does not.

Just before the Yom Kippur, the Sages of the Sanhedrin would turn the High Priest over to the Sages from among the priests. They would administer an oath, “Our Master High Priest, we adjure you, by the Name of He who makes His Presence dwell in this Temple, that you will not change a thing from the proper service.” After that, he would turn away and cry - because they suspected him of being a deviant. They would also turn away and cry. Why? - because anyone who suspects a righteous one will be punished.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Throughout the night of Yom Kippur, he would not sleep. Rather, if he was a Sage, he gave a lecture, and if not, scholars lectured him. If not, he would read from the Scriptures, or they would read to him. What did they read? - even action-filled “Chronicles” to keep his attention. Often he did not even know Hebrew, and they read the book of Daniel, which was in the vernacular (Aramaic).

<br />
Since all of Yom Kippur's services will be done by him, and they are kosher only if performed by a High Priest, this additional measure of separation was required to prevent even an unlikely possibility of him becoming ritually impure for the service.<br />
<br />
There was yet another event in the life of a High Priest when a seven-day separation was required, and that was before burning of the Red Heifer to provide ashes for the purification from a dead body. Both had their source in the Torah and were connected to the Levites' initial consecration for the services, when they likewise <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=8#P2948" target="_blank">spent seven days near the Tabernacle, separated from the rest</a>. Back then, the Levites did it "to do" "atonement." For the future, "to do" refers to the Red Heifer and "atonement" to Yom Kippur.<br />

Prominent people of Jerusalem would not sleep and would make their voices heard to support the High Priest.
<br />
<br />
Abba Shaul said, “They adopted this practice also in the provinces, except that they used the time for frivolities.” Elijah the Prophet met Rav Yehudah and told him, “You ask why the Messiah is not here yet? It is Yom Kippur, yet how many virgins lost their virginity this night in Nehardea!” Rav Yehudah asked, “And what does God say about it?” Elijah answered, “Sin waits at the door (that is, I, God, created the desire for illicit relations.).” Rav Yehudah asked again, “And what does the Accuser say? Elijah told him, “Accuser has no say on Yom Kippur.” The Gematria of Accuser (Satan) is 364, and on Yom Kippur, which is the day 365, he has no power.”
<br />
<br />
Normally, they would start the Temple service by taking away some ashes from the Altar at the rooster's call. On Yom Kippur, when more had to be done, they started at midnight. There was more to do at the festivals, and then they started the service after the first third of the night had passed.

When the Jews would come to the Temple on pilgrimage, they were crowded together so that each person stood straight as a beam, and at times his feet were occasionally lilted off the ground. However, when they had to prostrate themselves and confess their mistakes, miraculously, the space between them increased. There were four steps between each other – and this was one of the ten miracles that regularly occurred in the Temple.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud discusses the other miracles with their particulars, excluding some and adding others to the list. For example, the Bread of Vision remained piping hot after it was left on the Temple table for a week: since the verse literally said, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a21.htm">to put bread, warm, on the day, it (the old one) is taken off</a>,” we move the comma and understand that it was “warm on the day it was taken off.”
<br />
<br />
Another miracle was that king Solomon planted all types of fine fruit trees made of gold, and they produced fruit at the right times. This is mentioned in the phrase “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2672.htm">May its fruit rustle like that of Lebanon</a>,” and “Lebanon” always means the Temple. When the wind blew on them, the fruit would fall off, the priests gathered them and made their living from the profits. When the soldiers entered to destroy the Temple, the trees withered, but in the future, God will restore them since it says, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1035.htm">It will blossom abundantly... the glory of Lebanon will be given to it</a>.”<br />

The very first service of the day in the Temple was the separation of a small portion of ashes from the Altar and putting it down on the ground. Initially, any Kohen who wanted to do it could do it. When many Kohanim vied for the privilege, they would run up the Altar’s ramp, and the first to reach the Altar would win. However,  people started to fight. It happened that one pushed the other, who then broke his leg. The Sages, therefore, instituted a lottery, which was conducted in the following manner.
<br />
<br />
All Kohanim would assemble in a circle. One would take off his hat - he was the one from whom the count started. The Temple administrator told them to stick out one of two fingers; he would call out a large number and start counting from the first Kohen in a circle. The one on whom the count ended was the winner.
<br />
<br />
Why was there no lottery at first? Because the Sages expected that not too many people would rise early enough for this service. They reasoned that it is easier to stay late than to wake up early. Then they established running competition and later a lottery. However, the people stopped coming, saying, “Who knows if I will win the lottery!” So the Sages increased the reward, and the winner would get the removal of the ashes and two more subsequent mitzvot. 
<br />
<br />
And why did they count fingers and not people? Because one should not count the Jews.

Two people who did count were King Shaul and King David, and Talmud continues with them. King Shaul was without a blemish, and that exactly was his blemish. One needs to have a “basket of creepy-crawlies” behind his back so that if he becomes haughty, they can tell him, “Looks where you come from!” So even though Shaul did fewer wrong acts, David, when he erred, cried and asked for forgiveness, which counts more. 
<br />
<br />
Also, Shaul renounced his honor and did not take revenge on Amalek, as a king should. Any Sage who is not vengeful and does not keep a grudge like a snake - is not a true sage. Now, this last statement is problematic because the Torah said not to take revenge!? - It is only meant in monetary matters. But still, we learned that one should be forgiving!? - Yes, if the offender comes to apologize, but otherwise, the Sage should keep the offense in mind.
<br />
<br />
Before there was a lottery and people were still running up the ramp to claim the Temple services, once a priest, seeing the other one in front of him, thrust a knife and mortally wounded him. They eulogized him right there, and then the boy's father came and said that the death of his son should be the atonement and that his son was still alive, so they should take the knife out of him and avoid ritual contamination of the knife.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>He cared more about the knife than about his son! How could this happen? Did the purity become more important, or did the bloodshed become cheaper in their eyes? Alas, they cared little about life.<br />

What garments did it have to be performed in? That answer depends on the argument whether it was a real service or just a preparation, with the conclusion that it was a real service, and thus the regular four items of the Kohen's attire were required. 
<br />
<br />
How much of the ashes had to be put down on the ground next to the Altar? Should we learn from the separation of tithes and say it is one-tenth, or from the separation of the spoils of Midian and say it was one in five hundred? The conclusion is that we should learn from the separation of the flour offering, and it was a handful.
<br />
<br />
At times, besides the symbolic removal of the ashes, there was a real cleaning. What garments should this be performed in (they are called “other garments” in the Torah) – better or worse quality? Using the principle that “when a servant mixes wine for his master, he should not use the same garments as when he is preparing a dish for his master,” we conclude that the removal of the ashes was done in better quality garments. 
<br />
<br />
In general, if a non-Kohen performs a Temple service, he is liable to death at the hand of Heaven. However, only a complete, final service carries that responsibility. For example, is a non-Kohen liable for arranging the lamps of the Menora? - No, because there are also wicks. Is he liable or the wicks? - No, because there is also putting them in the lamps? Is he liable for that, then? - No, because there is also putting oil. And he is not liable for it either, because there is also kindling. Then surely he must be liable for kindling!? - No, he just holds a flame to the wick, and the wick ignites by itself.

Why were lots used for that? – What kind of question is this, for we already said it was to avoid discord!? – Actually, the meaning of the question is why assemble four times when one lot for all services could be sufficient? - It is good to stir up the Courtyard, for the greater the number of people serving God – the better.<br />
<br />
Did they use their regular garments or holy garments for the lots? Some say that they used the regular garments because otherwise, the bullies among the priests could seize services by force had they already been attired. Others say that if they drew lots in regular garments, they might rush and do the services in them, which would be wrong.
<br />
<br />
What was awarded in the second drawing? - Slaughtering the daily offering, throwing its blood on the Altar, cleaning the Inner Altar, cleaning the Menorah, and bringing the limbs of the daily offering onto the ramp of the Altar. Then we have the argument about the order in which the limbs were carried.

Yoma 26 – The last two lotteries of the day

Why? – Because it makes one rich. And how do we know that? – Because the Torah said, “They shall bring incense in Your presence,” and right after that, “bless, O God, his resources.” Finally, the fourth and last lot was to select who will take the limbs of the sacrifice from the ramp and bring them to the Altar. 
<br />
<br />
Depending on the festivities and the additional rituals for the occasion, the daily sacrificed could be offered by anywhere from nine to twelve Kohanim, but not less or more than that. The sacrifice itself was divided into nine pieces, and each was carried by another Kohen. On the Shabbat within the festival of Sukkot, there were the following additions: a flask of water to be poured on the Altar -- a special for Sukkot, the two blocks of wood, and the new Bread of Vision.

Thus, a ram was offered by eleven and a bull – by twenty-four priests. Each carried his own part of the animal; for the larger parts, more than one priest was required, and the flour offering, which consisted of three “hin” measures (about 3 liters each), each Kohen was bringing a “hin” in its own vessel. This was only done for communal offerings, for added honor, but for a private offering, if its owner designated one Kohen, this Kohen could bring the whole thing. For flaying and cutting up the sacrifices into parts – everybody was equal in that respect.
<br />
<br />
By “everybody was equal,” the teacher really means that even a non-Kohen was allowed to do the flaying and the cutting. But how do we know this? – Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=1#P2749">He shall have the burned offering skinned and cut into pieces. Aharon's sons shall place the fire on the Altar</a>...” we understand that starting from the fire service, a Kohen is required, but before that – he is not. 
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, although normally a non-Kohen who performs priestly service is liable to death at the hands of Heaven, slaughtering is an exception and can be done by a regular Jew. Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=1#P2748">He shall have the young bull slaughtered... and the sons of Aharon will bring its blood to the Altar</a>,” we see that beginning from the blood service, a Kohen is required. Still, that slaughter can be done by anybody – usually the owner of the sacrifice.

Because once they have mistaken the light of the moon for that the sun and slaughtered the morning sacrifice, but then had to take it out to the burning place for invalid offerings.
<br />
<br />
The first Jew, Abraham, was very precise with timings, and his Afternoon prayer, Mincha, was exactly at midday. We, however, cannot know the times as precisely as Abraham did because he was a master astronomer and astrologer. Moreover, he observed the whole Torah before it was given, having figured out what protective ordinances the Sages later enacted. From where do we know this? Because God says about Abraham that he “...<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=26#P698">obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My decrees, and My Torahs</a>” – that is, the written Torah and the additional Torah laws established by the Sages. In fact, the tradition continued in the family, and Isaac and Jacob also learned Torah and taught it.

But how was it possible? The light of the moon shows in a column, and the light of the sun is spread out!? – It was a cloudy day. This teaches us an additional lesson: the sun behind the clouds diffuses its heat. Why is that important? – for example, this may affect the leavening of matzah.
<br />
<br />
Rav Nachman continues with teachings about the sun. The sun bursting through the cloud feels stronger than in the open sky, just as the smell of vinegar in a jar, when released, feels stronger. The thoughts of wrongdoing are more harmful to a man than an actual act, just as the smell of roasting meat is more pleasing than the meat itself. Relearning something once learned but forgotten is harder than acquiring new knowledge, similar to making new cement from old cement. 
<br />
<br />
The rising of the sun spread behind the clouds is compared to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2622.htm">antlers of a morning hind</a>. On that subject, why was Ester compared to hind? – Just as a hind has a narrow womb and is desirable to her mate every time as the first one, so was Ester desirable to the king Ahasuerus. And so are the words of the Torah always beloved to those who learn them. And just as the antlers always grow, so too the prayers of the righteous become stronger as they persist in them. 
<br />
<br />
When did the incident of invalid early sacrifice occur? If on a weekday, why is it mentioned here talking about Yom Kippur. And if on Yom Kippur, the moon is yet small!? - Really, it occurred on a weekday, and this is a digression. Incidentally, bird offerings and flour offerings would also be invalid if offered before daybreak.

<br />
<br />
But what is special about Yom Kippur? Why not say that this seven-day separation has to precede any sacrifice? And if you tell me that we don’t know which Kohen will be doing the service, I will answer that maybe the whole group serving in the Temple on a specific week should require solitary confinement beforehand? - The Talmud answers that it is better to compare consecration, which was done only on a specific day, the eighth day of the service, to Yom Kippur, which is also only once a year, as opposed to sacrifices which are brought every day.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then tries to connect the seven-day separation to other holidays, such as Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret, and Rosh HaShanah - and disproves such connections, giving a specific reason. For example, other holidays occur three times a year, but Yom Kippur - only once. Finally, Ravina finds a reason that works in every case: Yom Kippur is special because all of its services were performed by the High Priest. This can only be compared to the first consecration, which was completely done by the first High Priest - Aharon.

Yoma 30 – Cleanliness in the Temple

If he moved his bowels, he needed a complete immersion in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikveh">mikveh</a>. In general, anybody who entered the Temple needed to go to the Mikveh first, even if he knew he was ritually pure.
<br />
<br />
Why are these extra measures of cleanliness? If one urinates, he may have drops left on his feet. Such drops may indicate the penis being cut in some serious way, in which case he may not be able to make a woman conceive. If he is married, people may think that his children are not really his, and to prevent this possible rumor, he needs to clean his feet. And since he will wipe the feet with his hands, he must now wash both.
<br />
<br />
On Yom Kippur, the High Priest will have to immerse himself in a mikveh five times, every time that he goes to a different part of the service. From here, we reason: if for going from one service to another a mikveh was required, then of course for entering the Temple to do the first service, certainly a mikveh was required – hence the requirement for anyone who enters the Temple to first go to a mikveh. Others say that the reason for the first immersion was different. While going through the water to purify himself, one may recall about an old, more serious ritual impurity that he had forgotten about. Thus it was only a device to remind him of his status.

Now he is going back to retrieve these. The phrase "Aaron shall go into the Communion Tent..." is out of order, but it makes a necessary interruption, adds two changes of vestments, and brings the total number of immersions from six to ten.

There were seven branches in the Menorah, but the preparation of the Menorah had to be broken into two phases. So first, they cleaned the five lamps and then, after an interruption, the remaining two. This interruption was provided by the slaughter and the throwing of the blood of the morning sacrifice.

Yoma 36 – The Name

The bull was standing between the Altar and the Temple's entrance, along the wall of the Altar, with its head turned to the right, in the direction of the Temple. The High Priest would also stand facing the Temple, put his hands on the head of the bull, and pronounce the following confession.
<br />
<br />
He would say, “Please, the Name, I have sinned willfully, rebelliously and inadvertently. Please, the Name, please grant atonement for the willful, rebellious and inadvertent sins – that I have committed before you, I and my household." Then he would quote from the Torah where the promise of forgiveness was given. The people who listened would prostrate and say, “Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingship, forever and ever.”
<br />
<br />
What was this Name? Some say it is was the four letter name of God, the Tetragrammaton, that the Torah commanded to conceal and that is commonly pronounced instead as “Adonai”, or my Master. Others say that the name that the High Priest pronounced was completely different from what we have in our texts, and that it was a secret name of forty-two letters. One of the reasons for concealment was the power that the name could give to the wrong person.
<br />
<br />
And where did the Torah command to conceal the Name? – When God told Moses, “This is My Name forever (leolam)” - read this word as “lealem” - to conceal.

The High Priest would next come, with his two attendants, to the two goats prepared for the lot. The chest for the lottery contained two lottery tickets made out of boxwood, one with the inscription "For God" and the other - "For Azazel." He would draw the lots with his two hands and designate the goats, one for the sacrifice and the other to be sent to the desert.<br />
<br />
Later Ben Gamla made the lottery pieces out of gold, and the Sages would recall him with praise. Other individuals should also be remembered for good. Ben Katin made twelve spouts for the laver so that the twelve Kohanim involved with the morning sacrifice could wash their hands and feet at once. He also invented a mechanical device that prevented the water in the laver from becoming unfit because of staying overnight.<br />
<br />
King Munbaz made all handles of vessels used for Yom Kippur out of gold. His mother Helene made a golden candelabrum at the Temple entrance so that when the sun rested on it, people knew to say the "Shema, Israel" prayer. Finally, Nikanor was a man for whom a miracle happened, and the heavy copper gate he had made for the Temple floated through the storm to the shores of Israel, and they kept that door and named it after him, long after the other doors were replaced with golden ones.<br />

The family of Garmu possessed the secret of baking the Bread of Vision for the Temple so that it would never crumble, and they did not want to teach this to anybody. Their official excuse was that they did not want it to fall into the wrong hands and be used in the service of idols. However, they were praised for never giving refined bread to their children so that nobody would suspect them of using the Temple bread. 
<br />
<br />
The family of Avtinas knew the secret of mixing the incense so that its smoke would always go straight up and did not want to teach it, with the same excuse. Their good quality was that their women would never use perfume – to avoid the suspicion of using Temple's incense. Hugras the Levite knew a special way to produce captivating singing but refused to teach it, not wishing it to be used for idols.
<br />
<br />
Ben Kamtzar would take four pens in his hand and write the four-letter name of God, finishing all the letters simultaneously, thus never leaving the name of God incomplete. He, too, did not want to teach this skill but could not quote a selfless reason for it. Thus, the bad people are all mentioned together with derision, but there is an additional blessing any time we mention a good person.

In the other hand, he held the lot “for Azazel.” He then placed the lot on the appropriate goat and pronounce “For God.” The people would again answer, “Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingship, forever and ever.”  Why did he have to snatch and not just take the lots? – So that he did not intentionally direct his right hand to the one marked “For God.” 
<br />
<br />
For the forty years of Shimon the Righteous, the lot “For God” always came up in the right hand of the High Priest. After his death, at times, it came in the right hands of the High Priest, but at times in the left. So too, during his tenure, the fire on the Altar was strong and never extinguished; even so, the priests continued to bring their two blocks of wood, but it was only to fulfill the mitzvah. 
<br />
<br />
For forty years before the destruction of the Temple, the lot “For God” would never come up in the right hand of the High Priest, the tongue of crimson wool would not whiten on Yom Kippur, and the doors of the Sanctuary would open on their own – until Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai rebuked them, saying that it is enough for the misfortune to come in its time.

Just as there, the priests stayed in the Temple for seven days, so must the High Priest prepare for Yom Kippur by seven days of separation. This, however, is the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan. Resh Lakish compares Yom Kippur to the giving of the Torah. Just as Moses was covered by the cloud for six days, everyone who is to enter Divine presence must prepare for this by being alone. 
<br />
<br />
Their disagreement is about how to understand the phrase of the Torah, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=24#P2191">And the glory of God rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it (or him) for six days</a>.” The words “Vaykasehu” can be understood as “covered it (the Mount)” or “covered him (Moses).” If God's glory covered Moses, then we can learn from here the behavior before Yom Kippur. But if it covered the cloud - then we cannot learn anything from it. Also, this difference in understanding leads to different dating of the giving of the Torah, the holiday of Shavuot (sixth or seventh of Sivan), and to a different understanding of the relationship between God and Moses: when God called to Moses, then, if the cloud was covering Moses, it signified the need to come close to God and receive the Torah. If, however, the cloud was covering the Mount, then, when God called to Moses, he was emphasizing that of all the Jews, He wanted to talk only to Moses.<br />

He pronounces the name three times in the first confession, three times in the second, another three – during the confession while sending a goat to Azazel, and once – during the lottery. Similarly, the goats in Jericho sneezed from the smell of the incense in Jerusalem, and women in Jericho did not have to perfume themselves because of this fragrance. 
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/12/yoma-39-he-snatched-lot-from-lottery-box.html">Earlier</a>, we described how the High Priest would snatch the lot from the lottery box and place each lot on the designated goat. If he omitted the procedure, the service would become invalid. Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=16#P3207">And Aharon will place the lots</a>,” the absence of this would become a show-stopper – these are the words of Rabbi Yannai. However, Rabbi Yochanan disagrees: in his opinion, the High Priest designates the goat on which the lot falls, and his words alone are sufficient. Thus, even if they omitted the lots altogether, the service would still be valid. All would agree that the lot's actual placement on the goats is not essential and could be skipped – although it is a mitzvah to do it.

The goat that stands to be slaughtered, he positions opposite the place of slaughter.
<br />
<br />
The last words “opposite a place of slaughtered” are intentionally ambiguous: it may mean next to the area where it is slaughtered, or it may mean that the strip of wool is tied next to the place of the cut in slaughter. The Talmud concludes that it is the latter; this was done so that the High Priest can tell this goat apart from all the other ones. This conclusion will change on the next page where Rabbi Yochanan does not mention the strip of wool that would go on the goat's throat.<br />
<br />
There were two strips of red wool: one here, on Yom Kippur, and another was thrown into the fire while burning the red heifer. Rabbi Yitzhak said that he heard from his teachers that one of them had a minimal weight, while the other did not, but he did not remember which one. On the one hand, the Yom Kippur strip was cut in pieces, with one piece remaining on the goat's horns and the other placed for observation in the Temple. When the remaining piece became white, people knew that they were forgiven. So it is reasonable to say that this strip needed to have at least some weight. On the other hand, the one thrown in the fire had to land inside it, not be burned on the first contact, so maybe it needed to be heavy. This remains unresolved.

However, when Rav Dimi came back from one of these numerous learning trips to Israel, he brought back the teaching of Rabbi Yochanan, which was later enhanced by Rabbi Yonatan, and they said that there were three such strips. They also provided the minimal measures: the strip for burning the red heifer was the heaviest, the weight of ten "zuz" coins - since it had to land inside the fire in which the red heifer was burning. Next was the strip tied to the horns of the sent-away goat and, since it had to be divided in two, it needed a minimum of two "sela" coins or eight "zuz." Finally, the third one was used to purify a leper (metzora), and it could be as light as four zuz. Thus the question was now completely resolved.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the red heifer, the Torah said that "it will be slaughtered in front of Elazar, the priest." From here, we see that one who slaughters it does not have to be a priest (Kohen). Others say that since it is a Temple service, the one who slaughters had to be a priest also. Regardless, the High Priests made a point of always slaughtering the red heifer themselves and otherwise showing their appreciation for this mitzvah.<br />

The laws of red heifer include multiple double exclusions, where one phrase excludes something, while the next one excludes part of the exclusion and, thus, includes a new law. For example, when the Torah said, "And you shall give it (the heifer) to Elazar the Kohen," this means that only "it" - the heifer in the time of Moses - is given to Elazar, but subsequent cows need not be given to Elazar (who was deputy High Priest). Rather, the service is done by the High Priest himself. Others say that rather it means that the cow is given to a regular Kohen.<br />
<br />
It is easy to understand those who claim that "not Elazar" means a regular Kohen. But how can it be "not Elazar but the High Priest himself?" What is the logic here? - It is based on the same word "the law" used both in the description of Yom Kippur, where all the service is done by the High Priest and in the description of the service of the red heifer.<br />
<br />
The Talmud goes through the subsequent fifteen phrases of the red heifer service, showing the exclusions and multiple opinions. When Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish studied this area of law, they could never come up with a consistent set of rules, but sometimes the next phrase would negate the previous, and sometimes not. Thus, they said that they were like foxes in a grain field, which can only take away the dust on its feet.<br />

Yoma 44 - The slaughter of the High Priest's bull
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0I6i4eO6HM5-uBLYx70XvPhS-nK6Q4dXIxZFvYRTNZdit2hjh5r0y-ryYIBJg4rqQsz6tETekl3o9d2PYJMtymMzYOV_gUZ33LHWRYvAPo8btDmhDLb3sLzgnul0jDr4F0XA9sFv3N4ib/s1600/Bull+by+John+Glover.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0I6i4eO6HM5-uBLYx70XvPhS-nK6Q4dXIxZFvYRTNZdit2hjh5r0y-ryYIBJg4rqQsz6tETekl3o9d2PYJMtymMzYOV_gUZ33LHWRYvAPo8btDmhDLb3sLzgnul0jDr4F0XA9sFv3N4ib/s320/Bull+by+John+Glover.jpg" width="320" /></a>The High Priest makes two confessions on the bull that he had bought with his own money: the first on himself and his house (wife), the second - for his brothers the Kohanim. This is logical, for when he asks for forgiveness for others, he should already have achieved one for himself.<br />
<br />
Now he comes to slaughter this bull. Just as with the previous morning sacrifice, he makes only the initial, most essential cut and lets another Kohen complete it. This is because he also needs to receive the blood - the second of the four sacrificial services, which are all to be done by him - and for this, he needs to be in front of the bull. He leaves that blood in a vessel with another Kohen, who stands on the paving stone outside the Sanctuary and stirs it so that it does not congeal while he proceeds with the incense service. He takes the shovel, goes up the Altar, scoops the innermost coals, and places them in the shovel. Then he places the shovel on another paving stone in the Courtyard and directs himself to bring the handful of incense.<br />

However, today he uses a golden one throughout, and a light one at that – to preserve his strength because it is a hard day for the High Priest, who is fasting like everybody. Every day a Kohen burned half of the incense in the morning and a half in the afternoon, but today the High Priest prepares two handfuls of incense to burn in the Holy of Holies. 
<br />
<br />
There are differences in walking and washing the hands – for the honor of the High Priest. Finally,  every day there were four pyres on the Altar, but today five, with the fifth added for the coals to burn the incense. The number of pyres is actually a disagreement: all agree that there were at least two, one of the sacrifices and another one for the daily incense, according to the verse “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=6#P2856">it is a burned offering on the flame on the Altar... and the (other) fire of the Altar shall be aflame</a>.” Some say, though, that there is an additional pyre to maintain the large pyre. Finally, those who require the fourth pyre say that it was used to burn the limbs of the sacrifices not consumed at night.

Yoma 46 - The fourth pyre

It was fired even on Shabbat, and therein lies the problem: lighting fire on Shabbat is prohibited. We understand that the Temple service overrides this rule, but to what extent? Therefore, Rav Avin qualified it: the pyre is started even for invalid (such as ritually impure) parts, but only if a fire had singed them.  
<br />
<br />Two potential prohibitions need to be overridden when burning sacrifices in the Temple: Shabbat and ritual impurity. Rav Huna said it is the first one overridden but not the second one, and Rabbah said it is only the second one. Abaye asked a question that is a problem equally for  both: the Torah said, “Bring the sacrifice in its time,” which seems to mean, “even on Shabbat and even if ritually impure.” Why prefer one exemption and leave out the other?
<br />
<br />
However, both have their answers. Rabbah uses the rule “ending should be like the beginning,” that is, since we may suspend the laws of purity at the beginning of bringing the sacrifice if we have no alternative, so too, in the end, we can burn parts that have become impure. There is no such logic for Shabbat. On the other hand, Rav Huna disagrees with the “ending like the beginning” principle. Rather, he says that Shabbat can be abrogated in this case since communal sacrifices are freely brought on Shabbat, but we never totally dispense with the laws of purity.

Yoma 47 – Kimchit, the flour girl

Why the ladle? - He puts the incense there – and he cannot do it in any other way because he will need to carry both the incense and the shovel with the coals together into the Holy of Holies.<br />
<br />
He takes the shovel into his right hand and the spices into the left one. Even though the incense is the main point, he carries it in the left because he needs the right hand for the heavier shovel with coals, which measured three “kav” (about three liters). This would be true even for the High Priest by the name of Ishmael, son of Kimchit, whose enormous hands held four “kav” of incense – because, in addition to being heavy, the coals are also hot.
<br />
<br />
Kimchit had seven sons, and they all served as High Priests during her lifetime – not because anyone died, but because of accidents when one was disqualified due to ritually impure saliva landing on his garment. The Sages asked Kimchit why she merited seven sons serve as High Priests, and she answered, “The beams of my house never saw the braids of my hair.” They answered, “Many did so, and it did not help them.”
<br />
<br />
What is the status of incense or flour particles that are found between the fingers of a Kohen? They are not properly inside or outside his hand, so it is unclear if they are part of the offering or the remainder. Because of this doubt, some say that only fat Kohanim could do this service. However, this opinion is not universal.

Yoma 48 - Unanswerable questions of Rav Pappa

All of the Talmud used to be learned by heart, so having a key such as this one would be of little help in other places.
<br />
<br />
First question: the incense between the fingers and hands of the High Priest on Yom Kippur - should it be burned on the coals or no? In the phrase, “and he will scoop with full hands, and he will bring...” which word is more important? If it is “he will scoop with full hands,” then even the particles in between are included, but if it is “and he will bring,” - then it is not his intention to bring them, and so they are not included.
<br />
<br />
Second: it is obvious that scooping should be done in the normal way? However, what if he did it just with his fingertips, or by pushing his hands into the incense and allowing it to collect inside - is this still acceptable or not?
<br />
<br />
As a preface to his third question, we need to recall that if one spilled the blood of a sacrifice on the floor and then scooped it back up, it is invalid, but if he received it into a vessel, then spilled from the vessel and scooped back, then it is valid. In the case of High Priest, if he spills the incense from his hands onto the floor and picks it up - is this valid, or does he have to scoop again from the shovel? Do we compare his hands to the animal's neck so that his procedure is invalid, as above, or do we compare his hands to a Temple's vessel, and then it is valid? The questions above remain without an answer.

Yoma 49 – A mistake of Rav Sheshet
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

They asked Rav Sheshet a question, “If a Kohen carries a part of a sacrifice in his left hand, is it valid or not?” He replied, “We should learn the answer from Yom Kippur: the High Priest <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/12/yoma-44-slaughter-of-high-priests-bull.html">carries the incense in his left hand, and the coals in his right</a>, and that is OK!” Firstly, why does he have to bring such strong proof from Yom Kippur? – Because he wants to show that even in this serious case where atonement depends upon it, the service done with the left hand is still valid. But secondly, we learned an explicit ruling that any service done by a blemished Kohen while sitting or with the left hand is invalid! With this, Rav Sheshet's answer is completely disproved. 
<br />
<br />
And Rav Sheshet, how could he make such a mistake? We have heard him quote this explicit ruling in another situation!? The answer is exactly that: previously, he did not know this ruling, so he compared it to Yom Kippur, then they taught him this ruling; now he changed his mind, and in fact, later taught it to others.
<br />
<br />
Another question: if a High Priest scooped the incense but died before he got a chance to bring it to the Holy of Holies, can a substitute High Priest use his prior scooping, or does the procedure have to be repeated? Here, after a few attempts, the Talmud does arrive at the answer: since later on the High Priest will have to pour the incense out into the shovel and then scoop from it again, we see that a substitute High Priest can do the same in case the first one dies. This proves it.

Yoma 5 - How important was the first Temple service?

What would happen if one skipped an element of it? Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Yochanan argue about this, with one of them saying that absolutely every element was important and missing it would invalidate the entire service. The other one says that acts that would not be essential in the future could be skipped at the Inauguration.
<br />
<br />
For example? - Leaning. One has to lean on every sacrifice with all his weight and declare the reason for it. If one does not, his service is inferior, even though it still counts. And how do we know that leaning may be omitted? - Because the Torah said, “And he will lean and be forgiven.” However, we know that only the blood of the sacrifices achieves forgiveness. This is a hint that leaning on the sacrifice is required, but it does not invalidate it if not done.
<br />
<br />
Thus, one of the Sages holds that leaning at Inauguration was essential. Which one?  The Talmud finds that in arguing with Rabbi Yochanan, his opponent mentioned that all Inauguration elements were essential. Since Rabbi Yochanan did not deny it, we know that this was his point of view too.
<br />
<br />
Another question: in what order did Moses dress the first Kohanim, Aharon first, and then the sons, or all at the same time? The Talmud first objects that whatever happened already happened, and we don’t need to discuss it. It says that even if we need it for the future, Elijah, the prophet, will tell us. Finally, it concludes that this is a valid question and finds two Sages who disagreed about it.

When the Torah said, “With this Aaron enters… with a bull,” - did it mean to include (with the bull or even with its blood), or to exclude (with the bull but not with its blood)? Rav Ashi suggested the following answer: “Does Aaron really enter dragging the bull by the horns!? - Of course not! Rather, he brings in the blood. Thus, the substitute High Priest can also bring the blood.” And Rav Ami, who disagreed, what is his logic? - He says, “With this Aaron is ready to come into the Holy of Holies” - that is, with the bull which he slaughters, not with its blood.
<br />
<br />
Does this bull represent communal offering or his private offering? If you accept that it is his private offering, then I have another question for you: can you exchange it for another (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-2-sacrifice-exchange.html">a prohibited act, but does the holiness transfer</a>?) We know that transfer (Temurah) only works for a personal offering, not for partners. Does the High Priest take all other Kohanim as partners in his offering (Temurah is invalid), or does he make his own atonement and achieve it as a side effect (Temurah is valid)? - No definite answer.<br />

What do the Sages answer? They say that this was true in the First Temple, which was relatively low. The wall, which had a thickness of one amah, served as a partition, and a door in that wall was used as an entrance. However, the Second Temple was higher, and the wall could no longer stand on its own due to its weight. Therefore, there were two curtains instead, marking the outer and inner parts of the would-be wall.

Yoma 52 - Inside the Holy of Holies
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivwjjpVR1xsUH51ftzbBxW6NEgrp2dYKtlAzIHb2RZGg4ZG8yub6JGQC7o6ksGE2cEzUSiu2isSvl7reOgCvIhoC4DWeuA6W5xppIKrWivcXSSFaTtcyZAUbftIvVjOl_iUVNfq6mJhGVX/s1600/Smoke.+Autumn+by+Jozef+Chelmonski.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEivwjjpVR1xsUH51ftzbBxW6NEgrp2dYKtlAzIHb2RZGg4ZG8yub6JGQC7o6ksGE2cEzUSiu2isSvl7reOgCvIhoC4DWeuA6W5xppIKrWivcXSSFaTtcyZAUbftIvVjOl_iUVNfq6mJhGVX/s320/Smoke.+Autumn+by+Jozef+Chelmonski.jpg" width="320" /></a>The High Priest, with the incense and the coals in his hands, would walk into the Holy of Holies. For that, he had to move between the two curtains separating it from the Sanctuary, first, all the way in one direction and then, inside of Holy of Holies, in the opposite direction, until he would reach the Ark.
<br />
<br />
Once he reached the Ark, he placed the shovel full of burning coals between the two poles of the Ark, heaped the incense on top of the coals, and the whole chamber filled with smoke. Then he walked back, still facing the Ark as the sign of respect, and before leaving the chamber, he recited a short prayer. He would not prolong it so as not to frighten the people by his delay.
<br />
<br />
Now, which Temple are we dealing with in this description? In the first Temple, there were no curtains, and in the Second, there was no Ark, since King Yoshiyahu hid it!? The answer is that we are talking about the Second Temple, and we did not mean the Ark itself but rather the place where the Ark stood before. But it says, “between the poles of the Ark!?” - Here too, understand “between the place of the poles.”

Yoma 53 – How to burn incense

This was not how everyone understood this phrase. The followers of Tsaddok said that the following words, “If he (the High Priest) comes in the cloud of smoke, then I (God) will appear to him there,” - prove that the High Priest must come in with the incense already burning. What did the Sages answer? This phrase teaches not the sequence of actions but the composition of the incense – that there must be a special herb called “one that makes the smoke rise” included in the composition of the incense.
<br />
<br />
What was the prayer of the High Priest before exiting? He said, “May it be Your will that the year be rainy and hot.” – If so, how does it help? Rather, he meant that if it is destined to be hot, it may also be rainy. He also added, “May the prayer of wayfarers (who ask to stop the rain) not be permitted to enter in front of You.”
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa was once on the road, the rain came upon him, and he said, “Master of the Universe, the whole world is happy, but Chanina is sad,” - and the rain stopped. When he reached home, he said, “Master of the Universe, shall the whole world be in distress and Chanina in comfort?” - and the rain came again. Rav Yosef noted, “What good did the prayer of the High Priest accomplish against Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa?”

Yoma 54 - Where is the Ark?

It was called “the Foundation Stone,” it protruded three finger-breadths above the ground, and this is where the High Priest would place his shovel full of burning coals.
<br />
<br />
Why did the teacher say, “after the Ark was taken away?” <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/12/yoma-52-inside-holy-of-holies.html">Earlier, we said that it was hidden</a>!? &nbsp;- This is a different opinion, based on a phrase from Isaiah, “Behold the days are coming when all that your forefathers have accumulated will be carried away to Babylonia.” The other two opinions are that the Ark was hidden right in its place, deep in the ground, or that it was hidden in the wood chamber, as the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/11/shekalim-16-thirteen.html">story about a Kohen who wanted to reveal it but died</a> tells us. 
<br />
<br />
When the Ark was in existence, its two poles protruded from behind the Curtain as two breasts of a woman, and that is what King Solomon meant when he said, “A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, lodged between my breasts.” A similar symbol was represented by the Cherubim, who were in a shape of a man and a woman joined in an embrace. At the time of the Temple destruction, the enemy soldiers entered the Temple, saw this, and said, “These Jews, who possess the power of blessing and curse, should occupy themselves with such pictures!” This is what Jeremiah meant when he said, “All who once respected her, now debased her, for they saw her nakedness.”

The blood never really lands on the Arks itself, “up” and “down” refers to the direction of his fingers in a whipping motion. 
<br />
<br />
To make sure that he maintains the correct count, he says out loud, “One, one-and-one, one-and-two… and so on.. one-and-seven.” - since any mistake in the counting would invalidate the whole procedure.
<br />
<br />
The High Priest then takes the blood of the goat, puts down the blood of the bull, re-enters the Holy of Holies, and sprinkles the blood of the goat, counting again, “One, one-and-one, etc.” Finally, he pours the bull's blood into the blood of the goat and then pours it all back to make the two types of blood thoroughly mixed.

Yoma 56 - Reminder notes

Otherwise, he would put the bull's blood on one golden stand first and then use the second one for the blood of the goat - and this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The Sages say that there were two golden stands.
<br />
<br />
But why does Rabbi Yehudah insist that there was only one stand? Let them make two, and put reminder notes on them, “Bull” and “Goat!” - That is because according to Rabbi Yehudah, people ignore reminder notes, so it would not help. - That could not be, because Rabbi Yehudah agrees that there were thirteen collection chests in the Temple, each marked with its appropriate name, like “New shekalim,” “bird offerings,” etc. He only disagrees about one chest, “Obligatory offerings,” about which he says it did not exist, and instead, this money was collected manually. But why not? Even if that money is accidentally mixed in, let us take out 4 coins and say, “These coins are retroactively designated as the original mixed in coins.” To that, I will answer that Rabbi Yehudah does not agree to the retroactive designation, also called “bereirah.”
<br />
<br />
And how do we know that Rabbi Yehudah does not accept the principle of retroactive designation? It may be deduced from the argument about tithing wine or from the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-36-running-away-from-tax.html">argument about eruv</a>. In any case, we are by now far away from the original question. The reason Rabbi Yehudah allows only one golden stand is the weakness of the High Priest, who might easily confuse the types of blood if there were two stands.

The verse continues, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=16#P3215">And he shall do this in the Tent of Meeting that dwells among them in the midst of their impurities</a>.” This teaches that God’s presence dwells among the Jews even when they are impure and imperfect.
<br />
<br />
A certain Sadducee said to Rabbi Chanina, “Now that you have been exiled, you are certainly impure,” meaning that Divine Presence is not found among you, as the verse in Jeremiah says, “<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm" target="_blank">And her impurity is on her hem</a>.” Rabbi Chanina proved him wrong by quoting the verse above.
<br />
<br />
We mentioned before that the blood never lands on the Ark itself. However, Rabbi Elazar disagrees. Once, he and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai traveled to Rome to annul some evil decrees. They met a demon Ben Tamalyon who offered to help them. This demon then possessed Caesar’s daughter, and she became insane. When the two Sages healed her, Caesar offered them anything from his treasury. They were only interested in annulling the decrees, which they did. It was then that Rabbi Elazar saw Temple articles and among them the Curtain. He now says that he saw it, and it had multiple spots of blood. But there are other ways to explain this difference.

He takes the blood of the ox and the goat and applies it to the four corners (slight protrusions, also called “horns” of the Altar.) Rabbi Yoshiyah says that he mixes the two types of blood in a vessel - based on the words “One application in a year.” However, Rabbi Yonatan says that the “and” in the “ox and goat” teaches two separate applications. Each one then needs to find an explanation for the Torah words used in his opponent's derivation.<br />
<br />
How does the High Priest apply this blood? Some say that he starts with that corner which he comes to first, following the rule that one cannot pass on a mitzvah if it came his way, and then walks around, while others say that he stands in one place and reaches to all the four corners with his hand. What is the reason for the argument here? It may be that they argue whether “he walks” means on foot or simply by hand. Others say that the argument is whether we derive the laws of the Inner Altar from those of the Outer Altar or if the laws of the Inner Altar are deduced on their own.

Why do we do this?</div>
The Talmud asks, what kind of question is that? <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/11/yoma-4-what-is-yom-kippur-like.html">We already explained:</a> according to Rabbi Yochanan, this is derived from the dedication ceremony, and according to Resh Lakish - from the giving of the Torah. The Talmud then rephrases: why do we separate him from his “house,” that is, from his wife? Let her go together with him!
<br />
<br />
The Talmud answers that there may be a doubt about her being ritually impure because of the menses and dismisses that: are we talking about non-observant people? Of course not! Rather, the doubt may arise my accident, later, after they had relations. If so, we should likewise be concerned that someone will die in his presence, and we should not allow him any human contact at all! The answer is that the ritual impurity of the dead is different: if most of the priests (and in our case, if the High Priest, the only one who can lead the Yom Kippur service) are ritually impure with the impurity of the dead, the service can proceed. Alternatively, the answer is that people normally don’t die suddenly in one's presence, so the Sages were not concerned about this possibility.

If, for example, he changes the steps in the previously described service of the <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/01/yoma-58-ox-and-goat.html" target="_blank">ox's and goat's blood</a>, sprinkles the goat's blood first, and then the ox's - he must repeat the sprinkling of the goat's blood again.

For example, if he did three sprinklings and then the blood spilled, he goes to the Courtyard, slaughters another animal, receives its blood, but now restarts from the sprinkling number four.</p><p>Rabbi Yehudah qualifies the first rule of "everything in order" - it only applies to the steps in the Holy of Holies, but not in the Holy. And Rabbi Nechemiah adds another qualification: the rule applies only to the steps done in white vestments but not in the regular golden vestments.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Study of a Goat by Pieter Boel</p>

This seems like leniency, but it leads to a problem. What they are saying is that you cannot ignore the first few sprinklings because they were valid.<p></p><p>Consider a case of a metzorah (spiritual leper) who likewise needs atonement. He gets it by bringing a guilt offering. What happens when a priest brings the offering for the wrong reason? - The offering is valid but does not count for its owner. Now we have a problem: we cannot ignore what was done and bring another sacrifice because it would then be two offerings for the same purpose, and that is not allowed. This metzorah never gets his purification. He has "no remedy."&nbsp;</p><p>That is not the only case of no remedy. Consider a Nazirite who is completely bald. The school of Beit Shammai says that he still needs to shave his head. However, since he has no hair, this need cannot be fulfilled, resulting in no remedy.</p><p>(Luckily for the people in question, the law does not follow these opinions.)</p><p>Art: Portrait of a Bald Old Man by Rembrandt</p><p><br /></p>

If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, they are still valid for service. 
<br />
<br />
If one of them died, then if it died before the High Priest drew the lots, they simply buy another one. However, if it dies after the lot was drawn, they bring a completely new pair and draw new lots. Now, since the first one was already consecrated, the High Priest stipulates as follows. If the one designated for God died, he says that the new goat designated for God will take its place, but the second one in the newly brought pair will not be needed, so it will go to graze until it dies of old age. Conversely, if the one designated for Azazel died, then the new one on which the lot for Azazel falls will be in his place, and the other one will go to graze. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah adds that if the blood of the goat “for God” was spilled, then the one for Azazel cannot be used. And if the one for Azazel dies, then the blood of the one “for God” should be spilled away. We understand the first rule: if the blood is spilled, the mitzvah is not finished and therefore not done at all, so the service cannot proceed. But if one for Azazel dies - well, it was going to be sent to death anyway!? Rabbi Yehudah’s view is based on a verse, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=16#P3209">It should stand alive in front of God to atone</a>,” which means that it should be alive until the service of the other is complete.

What if one instead took the two goats outside the Temple and slaughtered them there? Since these were bought with Temple funds, they became sanctified as a sacrifice at the point of sale.

The answer is that there will be a goat offering in the "mussaf' - additional offerings later today; these two goats can potentially qualify as such offering.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Two Goat by Adrien Dauzats</p>

<br />
<br />
He handed the Azazel goat to the person appointed to lead it to the cliff. Anyone could lead it, but the custom was that only a Kohen did it. They have built a ramp that led from the Temple Courtyard to outside the city of Jerusalem for leading the goat. It was constructed because of the Babylonians who would pull his hair and say to him, “Take our sins and go!”
<br />
<br />
They asked Rabbi Eliezer, “If the goat became sick, can the Kohen carry him” (given the prohibition to carry on Yom Kippur)? He answered, “The goat can carry you and me together!” Then, they asked him, “If the Kohen shoved the goat off the cliff, but it did not die, should he descend and kill it?” He answered, “May all the enemies of God perish!” The Talmud gives more evasive replies by Rabbi Eliezer but comments that he simply did not want to reply when he did not have a definite knowledge of the matter. However, the Sages give a positive answer to both questions.<br />

They could only walk with him on the first leg of the journey, though, because of the "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-45-residence-area-of-traveler.html">techum</a>" limitation: one cannot walk more than 2,000 steps away from his place of residence on holidays. There were twelve such stretches from Jerusalem to the cliff, with a booth prepared at the end of the first ten, and they accompanied him as far as the first booth.<br />
<br />
At each booth, there was an attendant who would tell him, "Here is food and drink" - not because he was absolved from fasting, but because he might feel weak. In reality, he never used this food because knowing that it was available was already helpful enough. The person waiting for him at the booth would accompany him to the next one. After the tenth booth, they would only accompany him for half of the way and then stand and observe his actions from a distance.<br />
<br />
He would part the strip of scarlet wool at the cliff, tie half of it to the goat's horn, and another half to a rock. He would then push the goat from the back, and it would tumble down, and before it reached half the mountain, it was already torn to pieces. The man would then go back to the last booth and sit in the shade until the day was over. Later, he had to purify himself in a mikveh because one who leads the goat becomes ritually impure.<br />

They were slaughtered earlier and will later to burned. He took out the sacrificial parts to be burned on the Altar, put them in a golden vessel, and braided the limbs of the two animals together. Other priests took them out to the burning place, carrying them on a pole and dismembering them before burning, not removing the skin. These priests became impure through performing this service.<br />
<br />
Now the High Priest had to wait until the goat would arrive at its destination, which was twelve "mil" (about eight miles) away. But how did they know that it was done? People would wave flags and see each other, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/01/yoma-67-waling-with-goat.html">one after the other, at each booth</a>. Others say that he only had to go for three "mil," and that is where the rock was, and the time was estimated by his envoy returning and then walking for another "mil," thus walking for the total of three "mil." Rabbi Yishmael says that the red strip of wool would always become white once the goat reached the desert, and that is how they knew.

Yoma 69 - Can one remove the desire to do evil?

They bring him the Torah. He stands up, receives it, and reads passages about Yom Kippur. If he wants to do this in the linen white garments in which he was performing the service, he is allowed to, or else he can use his own garments.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>In general, can Kohanim wear the service garments outside the Temple? Let us consider the following story. During the time of Shimon the Righteous, the Karaites convinced Alexander Macedon that Jews were organizing a rebellion, and he went to destroy Jerusalem. Shimon, the High Priest, donned his garments and went to meet him. Both parties walked all night and met at sunrize when Alexander descended from his chariot and bowed down to Shimon. He explained that he saw this man in a vision every time he went to battle, praying for him. Alexander then gave the Karaites into the hands of the Jews, who dragged them tied to horses to the Karaite Temple on Mount Gerizim, and destroyed it.
<br />
<br />
From this story, we see that a Kohen is allowed to wear his garments outside! - Maybe these were not the real garments but only similar to them.
<br />
<br />
In proving that one can indeed sit in the Women's Courtyard, the Talmud quotes a phrase from Nehemiah. It then continues with the events of that time. The Sages observed that the Evil Inclination has already succeeded in convincing people to worship idols, which led to the First Temple's destruction, and they fasted and prayed for three days for God to remove it. They were given this, and it came out of the Holy of Holies in the form of the roaring lion made of fire. They hid it away in a special magical vessel made of lead, and the desire to worship idols was much weakened.
<br />
<br />
Seeing that they had favor with God, they asked to destroy the desire for forbidden relations. When this was granted, the world stopped functioning and they could not even find a fresh egg for a sick person. Some say the "fresh egg" is the prayer on Shabbat, and it was not special like it always is. Understanding that they would not be granted to remove the desire only for forbidden relations, they were at least able to abolish the urge for one's relatives.

Yoma 7 – Is everything permitted?

However, does this mean that everything is permitted and that the laws of purity are temporarily abrogated, or perhaps we only make an exception where we have to? For example, if the priest shift who is serving this week is completely impure – on the first point of view, they would do the service, but on the second point of view – another group of the priest, from a different week, would be invited. Rav Nachman represents the first, more lenient point of view, and Rav Sheshet – the second, more stringent.
<br />
<br />
First, the Talmud limits the disagreement: if there are foods that need to be eaten, such as two loaves on Shavuot, everybody agrees that we look for ways to do it in purity. Also, when the sacrifice can be brought at any time, they wait until the priests become pure again. Thus, the disagreement only exists for holidays, such as Passover. Then, the Talmud finds an earlier disagreement, between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon, on the same question. This points to the fact that the argument cannot be resolved. Rather, its roots go back to much earlier times.
<br />
<br />
As a practical matter, Rambam rules that not everything is permitted: the rules of purity are not abrogated, but only an exception is taken in specific cases. Thus, when it is possible to find a way to maintain the purity, it should be done.

If he did it in his linen white vestments, he now sanctifies his hands and feet (by washing them from the golden flask), undresses, descends into the mikveh, immerses, ascends, and dries himself. They bring him the golden vestments; he dresses and again sanctifies his hands and feet. 
<br />
<br />
Then he continues with two services: his ram and the ram of the nation: he slaughters them, receives their blood and throws it on the Altar, and burns there the sacrificial parts. Then he sacrifices seven sheep (Rabbi Akiva says that he sacrifices them in the morning, together with the daily offering).
<br />
<br />
The High Priest then changes into white linen vestments again, with appropriate washings of the hands and feet – and returns to the Holy of Holies, to remove from there the ladle and the coal-pan.

He again washes his hands and feet before removing his white linen vestments, undresses, descends, immerses, ascends, and dries himself. This is his fifth and final immersion of the day. They bring him the golden vestments, he dresses and sanctifies his hands and feet. Then he enters the Sanctuary to burn the afternoon incense and to lights the lamps of the Menorah.</div>
<br />
He exits, sanctifies his hands and feet before removing his golden vestments, then undresses. They bring him his personal clothing, and he puts them on. They would escort him to his house, and he makes a feast for his friends upon exiting the Sanctuary safely. If he deliberately performed any part of the service improperly, he was liable with his life, and thus emerging unscathed was a cause for celebration. 
<br />
<br />
The regular vestments of a Kohen consisted of four items: a tunic, breeches, a turban, and a belt. The High Priest had eight, adding the breastplate, the “ephod” (apron), the golden plate worn on the forehead. When they needed to know God's advice by consulting Urim VeTumim, these vestments were required.

Yoma 72 - Torah, cure or poison?

The additional four garments of the High Priest were multi-colored: the breastplate was white, blue, red, and gold; the coat was blue wool. One who tore them was liable to punishment. The garments themselves provided atonement for the mistakes of the Jews. One can learn moral lessons from them and from the other vessels in the Temple. For example, the Ark was gold on the inside and outside to tell us that any Torah scholar whose outside is not the same as his inside - that is, who is insincere - is not a true Torah scholar.<br />
<br />
In general, the Torah itself can be a cure for some but poison for others. This is the meaning of the phrase, “And this is the Torah that Moses put (‘sam’) in front of the Jews.” The word “sam” means a drug of any kind and can cure or kill. Some say that one should learn it for the right reasons, and others - that he should understand it deeply enough.

Incidentally, the Kohen appointed for battle would go with the Jews to war and wear the same eight garments. After the war, he continued to serve in the Temple in the same outfit. Others say that he does not serve in the Temple at all. We cannot permit him to be like the High Priest because the real High Priest will feel bad about it. Neither can he wear the garments of a regular Kohen because they only raise in the level of holiness but never bring down.
<br />
<br />
Back to Urim VeTumim, what was it? Some say that inside the High Priest's breastplate, they put a piece of parchment with the name of God written on it, others - that it refers to the precious stones on the breastplate. The High Priest would be wearing it, the king would ask a question, and the answer would be formed by the letters protruding forward. Some say that only a worthy High Priest could see them protrude and then interpreted the answer.

Yoma 74 - How to properly afflict oneself

Just forbidden, you say? But it is more than this; one is liable to be cut off from the Jewish people and from his spiritual source! - The rule above is talking about a small amount, which is still forbidden. OK, this answer is good, according to those who say that a small amount of forbidden food is actually prohibited by the Torah. However, if the Torah does not mind a small amount, what is this rule talking about? It is still prohibited by the Sages.
<br />
<br />
What is the basis for this disagreement? Rabbi Yochanan says that since small amounts do add to the amount which is prohibited by the Torah, it must be that these small amounts are themselves prohibited, for otherwise, where does the prohibition come from? However, Resh Lakish says that eating a small amount is not called “eating,” Thus, it is simply not included in the prohibition. 
<br />
<br />
So how is one supposed to “afflict his soul?” Perhaps it means sitting in the sun on a hot day or in the shade on a cold one? - No, the nature of the required suffering is such that one refrain from such activities as eating, drinking, etc., but not that one actively seeks out to increase his suffering.

Yoma 75 - The affliction of manna

Others - that since manna could take on any taste but always looked the same, they were never satisfied with it. Rav Yosef (who was blind) demonstrates that a blind person eats but is never fully satisfied.
<br />
<br />
More parallel disagreements: what does this phrase mean, “Worry in one’s heart? - Quash it!” Some say that it sounds like “remove from your mind” - by studying the Torah. Others - to tell it to others. But how does this help? - Since others will suffer from hearing about your troubles, and they don’t deserve it, God will remove it from you to spare them this unwarranted suffering.
<br />
<br />
More facts about manna are drawn from the words describing it. For example, it was “like bread, oil, and honey.” How can it be? For young people, it felt like bread, for old - like oil, and for children - like honey, each according to the age preference.

Yoma 76 - Why was manna given daily

A king had a son, and he gave him his allowance once for the whole year. Consequently, his son visited him only once a year. The king then changed to giving him money daily, and now the son visited him every day. So too the Jews: one who had four or five children would worry, thinking, perhaps the manna will not fall tomorrow, and they will die of starvation. Thus, the Israelites now directed their hearts to God at all times.” Others say so that it would be warm and fresh. Yet others - so that they did not have to carry it.
<br />
<br />
Earlier, we mentioned the five things that one is should abstain from on Yom Kippur: <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/01/yoma-74-how-to-properly-afflict-oneself.html">food, drink, washing</a>, etc. Where does it say so in the Torah? - It could be that it is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, but because the term “deprivation” is mentioned five times, the Sages decreed five deprivations that one should sustain. Food, however, is named explicitly, and drinking is included together with eating. How do we know this last fact? - Because Torah mentioned drinking wine and put it in the list of food items.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, wine makes one wise, and excessive drinking leads to poverty. This is reflected in the word “tirosh” used for wine. If one deserves, it makes him “rosh” - head; if not - it makes him “rash” - poor.

It then continues with these verses, which tell the story of the angel Gabriel being expelled from the Heavenly court but brought back “because of the words of Daniel.”
<br />
<br />
Daniel was shown in a vision that twenty-five people were standing in the Temple, bowing to the sun in the east, with their backs toward the Temple on the west. Since their faces were to the east, we already know that their backs were to the west; why is this mentioned? The real story was that they bared themselves and defecated toward the Temple as an additional sign of contempt. The Holy One Blessed be He said to the angel Michael, “Your nation has sinned!” Michael suggested to spare the nation because of the good ones among them, but the answer was, “I will burn them together with the good ones who did not protest.” At this time, Gabriel asked another angel, a Cherub, to bring the coals, took those coals, and threw them on Jerusalem. However, since the coals cooled somewhat, the nation survived. They gave Gabriel sixty fiery lashes (pulsa d’nura) and expelled him. Gabriel continued arguing on behalf of the Jewish people, and when he mentioned Daniel, the Holy One Blessed be He asked, “Who is he that is advocating on behalf of my children?” - and Gabriel was brought back. As a result, however, Persians, and especially later Greeks, were given dominion. 
<br />
<br />
Even though washing is forbidden, if one wants to visit his father or his teacher on Yom Kippur, and a river separates them, he can cross even if the water reaches his neck. He is even allowed to go back since otherwise, he will refrain from going in the future. Only washing for pleasure is actually forbidden.

Perhaps this is one of the reasons why wading through a river is allowed - because one won’t come to carry his shoes, should they fall off? What about Shabbat - can one cross the river, given that now he has shoes and might potentially carry them? Nehemiah saw Rav Ami and Rav Asi cross a pool of water on Shabbat. The actual incident with someone trustworthy is the best proof, and so this is accepted. What about sandals that slip off easier? - there, it is preferable not to cross the river in them. Here is an actual story about it.
<br />
<br />
A Jewish ruler (Exilarch) n Babylonia came to the city of Hagronia and lectured there. All the Sages came to his lecture, except Ravina. Since Ravina may have offended the Exilarch, Rafram came to exonerate him and asked him why he missed the lecture. Ravina answered that his foot was hurting. “Then you should have put on a shoe!” - “It was the top of the foot.” “Then you should use a (loose) sandal!” - To this Ravina answered, “There was a pool there, and it is preferable not to cross a pool in a sandal on Shabbat.” 
<br />
<br />
The standard material used for making shoes is leather. When talking about not wearing shoes on Yom Kippur, do we mean only leather shoes or perhaps any kind of shoes? Again, an actual story helps: Rav Yitzchak saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi wearing shoes made out of rush (reed) on Yom Kippur. And yet, some say that all kinds of shoes were meant.

<br />
<br />
Rav Pappa wondered, “Date with the pit or without?” A similar question was asked by Rav Ashi about a human bone the size of a barley seed, which makes one ritually impure. Rav Ashi asked, “Dry seed or moist? With the shell or without?”
<br />
<br />
Note that each of the Sages did not have any problem with the other one’s question. Rav Ashi would tell you that “large date” implies as large as it can be, that is, with the seed. In turn, Rav Pappa would retort that a fresh barley seed has a different name, “shibboleth,” and one with the shell is called “ushla.” So the choice of the words itself in the rule already gives them the answer.
<br />
<br />
And why specifically, a large date is used as a measure of prohibition for Yom Kippur? After all, it is less than an egg and is thus not considered a meal!? - The Sages estimated that this volume cools off the hungry person's&nbsp;mind, although it does not satisfy him completely.<br />

Yoma 8 - Tzitz

It fixes the defects of the sacrifices so that even those sacrifices that were not normally acceptable become so with the help of the Tzitz. This is expressed by the Torah as follows, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=28#P2329">So that Aaron will bear the sin of the sacred offerings</a>.”
<br />
<br />
However, which offerings could the Tzitz make kosher? If the priest bringing it wanted to eat it in the wrong place, it “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=19#P3286">would not be acceptable</a>,” and if he even wanted to eat it at the wrong time, it “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=7#P2895">would not be considered</a>.” Thus, the only problem that the Tzitz could fix was the offering that became ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
Did the Tzitz have to be on the forehead of the High Priest to be effective? That depends on the understanding of the word “always (Aaron will wear it).” You can understand that whenever Aaron wears it, it is effective, but not otherwise. Or, you can say that “always” means “constantly when possible,” but even when it is not possible to wear it (such as during sleep), it still works. The Talmud tries to resolve its earlier question,&nbsp;<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/11/yoma-7-is-everything-permitted.html">whether the laws of purity are completely abrogated or if they only allow a few exceptions</a>, using the laws of Tzitz, but alas, Tzitz allows both interpretations. Incidentally, from Tzitz, we derive that one who wears <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin">tefillin</a> must be constantly mindful of them.

But, how do we know this?
<br />
<br />
Since the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3029">Any food that is eaten</a>,” we understand that we are talking about food coming from another food. And what is it? - Chicken egg: it is food, and it comes from another food, a chicken. But maybe it is a young goat, which comes from its mother, who is also food? - No, it does not just "come," but it requires slaughter. But perhaps it is an egg of a bar-yuchani bird, which is as big as sixty cities? - No, because we have a rule: one, who tries to grab a little, succeeds in that, and may even be added more, but one who tries to grab a lot - he may not be given anything at all, and so we have to limit ourselves to a chicken egg. But perhaps the Torah meant an egg of a tiny bird?
<br />
<br />
The last question is indeed irrefutable, and we abandon this complete chain of questions and answers. Rather, “Any food that is eaten” implies that it is eaten in one gulp, and the Sages estimated that the throat cannot hold more than a hen’s egg.
<br />
<br />
Back to measures of food for which one bears responsibility if he eats it on Yom Kippur: solids in the amount of a large date, and liquid - a full cheek. How can we have one measure that depends on an objective average large date and another - on his personal cheek capacity? - The Sages estimated that this much would assuage the suffering of the fast, and less than that would not. This is even true for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og">giant called Og</a>, whose full cheek was huge but whose limit of solid on Yom Kippur would also be a large date.<br />

The Torah prohibited eating to alleviate hunger, but what he is doing cannot be properly called eating, but rather damaging, both his body and food.<p></p><p>If one both ate and drank, in the same period of forgetfulness - either he forgot it was Yom Kippur or forgot that it is not allowed to eat or drink - it counts as only one transgression. That is because both eating and drinking are covered by the same prohibition of "afflicting oneself by hunger." When he realizes what he has done, he would have to bring one sin-offering.</p><p>However, if he ate and worked, these are two separate prohibitions, and for this, he will have to bring two sin-offerings. If he ate something that people normally don't eat (like spoiled meat) or drank something that people normally don't drink (like fish brine), he is not liable to any sacrifice.</p><p>When one prepares for Yom Kippur on the day before, he gets a double reward. The Torah said, "You will fast on the ninth of the month." But the fast is on the tenth! This shows you that the one who eats and drinks on the ninth gets a reward as if he fasted for two days in a row.</p><p>Art: Il Mangiafagioli by Annibale Carracci's</p>

Therefore, they feed her that food until she feels better.&nbsp;</p><p>A sick person on Yom Kippur - if the experts say that he would be in danger if he does not eat, they give him food. If there are no experts there - they ask him. If there is a disagreement between him and the experts, his opinion wins.</p><p>In general, one can violate any Torah's prohibition to save a life - with three exceptions: idol worship,&nbsp; illicit relations, and murder.

The words of the "Shema" - "You shall love God your Lord with all your heart, all your soul, and all your possessions" mean that one should give up his soul or possessions but not worship idols.</p><p>Murder prohibition is derived from logic. If a governor tells one to kill a person or be killed himself, one should allow himself to be killed but not become a murderer. How does one know that his blood is redder than that of the other person?</p><p>Connected to murder is the law of prohibited relations: a betrothed maiden can be saved from rape at the cost of her pursuer's life.

However, on Yom Kippur, they give it in small amounts.<p></p><p>Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Yose were once on the road. Bulmos seized Rabbi Yehudah, and he ate all the food of a nearby shepherd. Rabbi Yose remarked, "You cleaned up this shepherd!' When they arrived at a city, bulmos seized Rabbi Yose. The city residents surrounded him with all kinds of dishes. Now Rabbi Yehudah said, "I cleaned up a shepherd, but you clean up the city."</p><p>The same Rabbis were once traveling with Rabbi Meir. They arrived at an inn whose owner's name was Kidor. Rabbi Meir considered this a bad name because of the phrase "Kidor" - <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=32#P5773" target="_blank">because they are a generation that cannot be trusted</a>&nbsp;and did not trust Kidor with his purse. Instead, Rabbi Meir hid the purse at the Kidor father's grave. Kidor's father appeared to his son in a dream and told him to go appropriate the purse. Kidor asked the Rabbis about the dream's meaning, and they told him that Friday night dreams mean nothing. Instead, Rabbi Meir guarded his purse all of Shabbat.</p><p>The other two Rabbis did trust Kidor with their purses, and the next day he denied getting them. They saw some lentils on his beard (because he did not do washing hands after the meal.) They went to Kidor's wife and told her that Kidor instructed to give them their purses, and as proof, they said that she fed him lentils. She gave them the purses, and Kidor killed his wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Yehudah then asked Rabbi Meir why he did not warn them. He said that the name is enough for one to be suspicious but not to tell bad things to others.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Shepherd’s Meal by George Morland</p>

For example, this is common when an observant Jew does something wrong. There are various means of atonement for it, such as Yom Kippur, suffering, death, or better, the study of the Torah and teaching it to others.<div><br /></div><div>It also depends on the person. For example, Rav, a prominent Torah scholar in Babilonia, said that <i>Hillul Hashem</i> occurs when a scholar like him does not pay the butcher's bill on time. The reason is, such behavior will lead the butcher to suspect stealing. Abbaye said, "This applies only in the city where the customers bring money to the butcher. But if the custom is for the butcher to go and collect money owed, this is not a problem."</div><div><br /></div><div>On the positive side, one should accumulate wisdom and deal with people pleasantly.

What is the proof? - from the phrase “Return… you have stumbled in your iniquity.” Iniquity is something done on purpose, yet here it is called “stumbled.” 
<br />
<br />
But we know more than that; his willful bad acts become his merits! What is the proof of that? - “And if a bad man turns away from his bad deeds… he shall live on account of them.” That is, even his bad deeds will provide merit for his future life. How can both be true? - the first applies when he apologizes out of fear, and the second - when he does it because of love.
<br />
<br />
Should one apologize again for something he apologized for last year? Some say he should not: he was already forgiven, and now he can only be sullied again by his memories. Others, however, say that it is even better, following the psalms, “I recognize my transgressions, and they are always in front of me.”

Rav was explaining Torah verses in the class of his teacher, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. Every time a new student came in, he was forced to start from the beginning, out of respect for him. Finally, when Rabbi Chanina came in, Rav did not restart, and Rabbi Chanina was offended. For thirteen years, Rav came to ask forgiveness on the eve of Yom Kippur, but Rabbi Chanina was not appeased.
<br />
<br />
How did Rav do it, seeing that one should not ask for forgiveness more than three times? - Rav went beyond the letter of the law. And how could Rabbi Chanina not forgive? We know that if one overlooks an insult and does not insist on his rights, then the Heavenly court overlooks his mistakes and the fact that he himself is unworthy? - Rabbi Chanina had a special reason: in a dream, he saw Rav hanging from a palm tree, and he knew that this meant that Rav was destined to become the head of the academy. This meant that he, Rabbi Chanina, who was the head of the academy in Israel, would have to die to vacate the post. Therefore, he pushed Rav to go to Babylonia, where Rav finally established his great academy, which existed for eight hundred years.
<br />
<br />
If one has a seminal emission on Yom Kippur, his sins are forgiven. But we learned in another place, “his sins are arranged in front of him!?” - Arranged to be forgiven.

This was because the High Priests of the first Temple were of greater stature. 
<br />
<br />
In fact, during the 410 years of the First Temple, there were a total of eighteen High Priests, which makes for 22 years in service on average. However, during the Second Temple, when they would buy High Priesthood with money, there were 300 of them during the 420 years of the Temple. If you subtract the forty years of service of Shimon the Righteous, eighty of Yochanan the Great, ten of Rabbi Ishmael, and eleven of Elazar ben Charsom, you will see that the majority of the High Priests did not live out one year of their service.
<br />
<br />
During the First Temple, bloodshed, immorality, and idol worship were abundant, yet only the Temple's roof was destroyed, and that only for seventy years. However, during the Second Temple, when ostensibly they were learning Torah and doing good deeds, the Temple was razed to the ground and is still not rebuilt. Why is that? – Because they slandered each other in secret and transgressed in secret. However, Resh Lakish presents another view: the later generations are greater because they still learn Torah with all the hardships.

What effect does this have on the sacrifice, even if he does not fulfill his intent later?<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish says that it is valid, but Rabbi Yochanan says that such a sacrifice is invalid. Rabbi Yochanan says that it is invalid, because he subscribes to the following principle: one can effectively “think ahead,” that is, that an intention that the kohen has for the following step of the service can affect what he is doing now. This result comes out because Rabbi Yochanan compares the intention that changes the type of sacrifice to the intention that changes its proper time or place, about which we will learn that it indeed disqualifies the offering. Resh Lakish holds that future intent does not count and considers the offering still valid.<br />

Zevachim 100 – Does the Mourner  Eat the Passover Sacrifice?

The Talmud gives five possible scenarios of how both can be true, one of them being offered by Abaye: one refers to a case when the mourner's relative died before midday, and the other – when he died after midday.<br />
<br />
If the relative died before midday when the mourner was not yet fit to offer a Passover sacrifice,  then the laws of mourning devolve on him first and prevent him from offering the sacrifice. If, however, the relative died after midday, the mourner was already obligated to bring the Passover sacrifice from before, and then the state of mourning does not prevent him from bringing the sacrifice.<br />
<br />
But do we find anywhere a difference between before and after midday? - Yes, we do! There was a story about a kohen named Yosef who did not want to become ritually impure because of his wife's burial, and the other kohanim forced him. On the other hand, the Torah tell the kohanim not to go into the cemetery, with the exception of burying his relatives? We have to say that one ruling applies after midday, while other one – before.<br />

<br />
He said “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/10-17.htm">Why did you not eat the sin-offering of New Moon?</a>” Moses asked Aaron, “Perhaps its blood was accidentally brought into the Most Holy chamber?” But Aaron replied, “Behold, it was not brought inside.”<br />
<br />
Moses then asked, “Perhaps it went outside the boundary,” but Aaron replied that it was always within. Moses then suggested, “Perhaps you offered it when you were mourners and thereby disqualified it?” - to which Aaron replied that he, the High Priest, has brought it, and the High Priest does not disqualify an offering even as a mourner. <br />
<br />
Having exhausted all possibilities, Moses demanded <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/10-18.htm">why it was not eaten, when they were commanded to do so</a>, and Aaron replied, “Today such things (as the death of my sons) happened, so perhaps you did not hear right what God has said, but eating should apply only <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/10-19.htm">to the inauguration sacrifices, and not the New Moon ones</a>.”<br />

Moses agreed completely and said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/10-20.htm">I heard it but forgot</a>.”<br />

Now he had to face the challenges.<br />
<br />
In the previous argument with Aaron about eating the sin-offering, why didn't Moses eat it himself, for he, unlike them, was not precluded by mourning? Rav answered – he was busy talking to God from morning till evening.<br />
<br />
When Miriam contracted leprosy, it was not Moses, who was not a kohen, who pronounced her status, and not Aaron, who was a relative, but it was God himself, who also was a kohen, Who confined her and later released her. We see from this that Moses was not a kohen!  - No, maybe leprosy is specifically given to the sons of Aaron to decide.<br />
<br />
In truth this is an&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">argument found</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;between earlier authorities of the Mishna, for when God became angry with Moses for refusing to go Egypt, this, unlike all other angers, left no mark – so says Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha. However, Rabbi Shimon says that this anger too left a mark, and Aaron became a kohen instead of Moses, who thus remained a Levi.<br />

However, this is true only if the offerings is valid; otherwise the meat is burned away from the Altar, and the hide is destroyed with it. <br />
<br />
Therefore, the rule is that whenever the Altar does not get the right to the meat, the kohanim do not get the right to the hide. However, if an offering was valid even for some time, so that the Altar got the right to the meat, the kohanim acquired the right to the hide. This rule is derived from a phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-8.htm">the burnt offering of a man</a>.” Since the rule would be also true for a woman, the extra word “man” teaches us that it was valid for men to eat.<br />
<br />
Hides of regular offerings, such as a peace offering, belong to their owners. Hides of all most holy offerings other than the burnt offering also belong to the kohanim, and this is derived through logic: if in the case of a burnt offering, where the kohanim do not eat the meat, the hide nevertheless goes to them, then for a sin offering, where the kohanim do eat the meat, certainly the hide goes to them.<br />

Only if the offering was skinned before it became invalidated, then the kohanim get the hide. Rabbi Chanina, the long-time administrator of the kohanim says, “In all the days of my life I never saw an invalidated hide being burned” - meaning that the invalidation discussed above never happened. But the Sages say that “I never saw” is not a proof. <br />
<br />
There are special sin-offerings, such as the goat brought for communal idol worship, that are not eaten but are burned in a designated place outside Jerusalem, called the place of ashes. These offerings contaminate the people who are carrying them, and they contaminate even the people's clothing. The offerings were carried out on poles. The first group of carriers becomes impure when it leaves the Courtyard, while the second group remains pure until they in their turn leave the Courtard. Rabbi Shimon says that none of them become impure until the fire catches onto the larger part of the sacrifice. <br />

Or perhaps, since the limb belongs to the body, and the body is only half-out, then the limb is considered inside?” To this there was no answer.<br />

What happens when one transgresses this prohibition? <br />
<br />
If one slaughtered and burned a sacrifice outside the Temple, he is liable for slaughtering it, and he is liable for burning it as well. Rabbi Yose HaGlili says: “If he slaughtered the sacrifices inside the Temple, so that it was indeed valid, and then burned it outside, then he is liable for burning. But if he slaughtered it outside, then it became invalid right away, and he is not liable if he then burns it.”  <br />
<br />
But the Sages told him, “Even in your case, when he slaughtered the sacrifice inside the Temple, it becomes invalid as soon as he takes it out. Then he should not be liable for burning it outside! According to your logic, Rabbi Yose, one should never be liable for burning an offering outside. This proves that you are wrong, and that when one slaughtered and burned an offering outside the Temple, he is liable for both acts.<br />
<br />
Challenge: what can Rabbi Yose answer in his defense?<br />

Zevachim 107 – What does “Outside” Mean
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiP8si_HljnDAB6dcxpF4VZ2DrgK3Pwf8y15wWvJpkV4WBFM7vFFUmmm64_GMNE63ca-ZrwFr-513raztzIChbvvggW6mEHlQ0MHlVF1c95Dxs6V7LcXGX6ozBrNUi4Q0AVD-prw8N_sT8/s1600/Cornelis+van+Leemputten+-+Shepherdess+with+Sheep+in+a+Landscape.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiP8si_HljnDAB6dcxpF4VZ2DrgK3Pwf8y15wWvJpkV4WBFM7vFFUmmm64_GMNE63ca-ZrwFr-513raztzIChbvvggW6mEHlQ0MHlVF1c95Dxs6V7LcXGX6ozBrNUi4Q0AVD-prw8N_sT8/s320/Cornelis+van+Leemputten+-+Shepherdess+with+Sheep+in+a+Landscape.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">One who offers sacrifices outside the Temple is liable, but what does “outside the Temple” mean?<br />
<br />
The verse states, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-3.htm">And any man from the House of Israel who will slaughter an ox, a sheep or goat in the camp... and he did not bring it to the Tent of the Meeting</a>... ” &nbsp;We might think that even if he takes a sacrifice that is normally brought in the northern part of the Courtyard and slaughters it in the southern part of the Courtyard – he would already be liable.  To dispel this notion, the Torah added, “outside the camp.”<br />
<br />
But now that the Torah has said, “outside the camp,” you might think this to mean outside of all three special camps, that is, outside the Temple, outside the Temple Mount, and even outside Jerusalem – that only then one would be liable. For that, the Torah said, “in the camp.” Thus, if he slaughters a sacrifices in the south, even if it is not its place, it is not called “outside,” because some other sacrifices can be brought there. However, if he slaughters it outside the Courtyard, then he is liable for “slaughter outside.”<br />

Zevachim 108 - Stringencies of Slaughtering and of Offering Up a Sacrifice Outside

<br />
If one takes an animal that was consecrated as a sacrifice and slaughters it for someone's consumption, he is liable to slaughtering outside. If, however, he offers it up for someone, he is not liable for offering up a sacrifice outside the Temple, because he did not dedicate it to God. In truth, he is liable for idol worship for&nbsp;worshiping&nbsp;that human, but that is a different liability.<br />
<br />
Offering up is more stringent in this way: if two people held a knife together and slaughtered a sacrifice outside the Temple, they are not liable, but if they took a sacrificial limb and offered it up, they are liable.<br />
<br />
If one offered a limb of a sacrifice, then became aware that it was prohibited, then forgot it, then offered another limb, again became aware and again forgot it, and so on, he is liable for each limb – so says Rabbi Shimon, but Rabbi Yose makes him liable just once.<br />

Zevachim 109 – Does One Need an Altar to Sacrifice Outside?

<br />
What is Rabbi Yose's reason? - It is written, “<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/8-20.htm">and Noah built an altar to God</a>” - which proves that an altar is required. And what is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? - It is written, “<a href="http://bible.cc/judges/13-19.htm">And Manoach took the goat-kid and the flour offering and he offered them up on the rock to God.</a>”<br />
<br />
How does Rabbi Shimon explain Noah's altar? - He says it was built only to provide comfortable height upon which to perform the sacrifice. And how does Rabbi Yose explain the rock of Manoach? - An angel told Manoach to act thus.<br />
<br />
For what sacrifices is one liable when offering them outside? - Any valid sacrifice, or even an invalid one if it would be accepted on the Altar after the fact. One is liable for offering an olive's volume of the meat, flour, and incense. For non-blood offerings, Rabbi Elazar makes him liable only for a complete amount.<br />

In fact, the Torah says that “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-30.htm">Any sin-offering whose blood was brought into the Tent of Meeting... may not be eaten</a>.” Rabbi Eliezer says that this is also true of the guilt-offering, since the Torah said, “just as the guilt-offering so is the sin-offering,” but the Sages insist that this is only true for the sin-offering.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of the Sages - for seemingly, the Torah supports Rabbi Eliezer? The Sages defend with this logic: if burnt offering, which is completely burnt, is not disqualified by bringing its blood inside the Temple, then the guilt-offering, which is not completely burnt, surely cannot be thus  disqualified! Now the arguments are as follows:<br />
<br />
* burnt offering is no proof, because it does not achieve atonement!<br />
* but the flour of a the one who swore falsely achieves atonement and still it is not disqualified if part of it is brought inside!<br />
* but the flour does not require slaughter!<br />
* but burnt offering does require slaughter and is not disqualified!<br />
<br />
We came a full circle. What is common between all these? That they are holy and are not disqualified by bringing their blood inside, so the guilt-offering is not disqualified – say the Sages.<br />

A handful of flour is separated first and burned on the Altar, and then the remainder is eaten by the Kohanim. If one burned this remainder as an offering outside the Temple, he is not liable, because the remainder was not destined for the Altar. If, however, he mixed the handful back in and burned the mixture outside – he is liable, because after all the handful has been burned.<br />
<br />
If one throws a part of the sacrificial blood upon an altar outside the Temple, he is liable. On Sukkot, they poured pure water on the Altar, in addition to wine, and Rabbi Elazar says that for puring this water outside one is also liable. Rabbi Nechemia makes one liable even for pouring the remnants of the blood of the offering, since the remnants are supposed to go to the base of the Altar.<br />

<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />
If he performed regular kosher slaughter of the bird with a knife and offered it up – he is, contrary to the expectations, liable, because of an additional phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-3.htm">or who will slaughter</a>.”<br />
<br />
We thus find that what makes the bird a valid sacrifice (melikah) inside  makes one not liable if done outside, and what makes one liable (shechitah, or kosher slaughter) outside makes one not liable if done inside.<br />

If one sacrifices this cow as an offering outside the Temple, he is not liable, because the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-4.htm">and to the entrance of the Tent of the Meeting he did not bring it</a>” does not apply to it. In the same way the scapegoat that is sent away on Yom Kippur does not entail liability if sacrificed outside.<br />
<br />
Other animals do not entail liability for sacrificing outside because they are cannot be brought “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-4.htm">as an offering before God</a>.” This list includes an animal that has sodomized a person or was sodomized by a man, one designated as idolatrous sacrifice or one that was worshipped, one that was used as dog's exchange or a harlot's payment, torn by a wild beast, or born by Caesarean section.<br />

Resh Lakish says that it was pre-inspected to be free of corpse impurity, but Rabbi Yochanan says that it simply means that it was outside the walls of Jerusalem.<br />
<br />
The root of their argument is the question whether the Flood extended to the Land of Israel. According to Resh Lakish, it did, and therefore there were remains of people embedded in the earth. According to Rabbi Yochanan, the Flood did not visit Israel, and people's remains were not a concern.<br />
<br />
But did not Nebuchadnezzar also kill Jews? - Their remains were cleared away, says Rabbi Yochanan. And Resh Lakish? He says that they were cleared away from Jerusalem, but not outside.<br />
<br />
But if the Flood did cover Israel, how did the gigantic sheep called Re'em survive? According to Rabbi Yochanan, all is well, and the Re'em stood in Israel. Says Resh Lakish, Re'em was then a young cub! But Rabbah bar bar Chanah saw a cub of a Re'em, and it was like a mount Tabor! Says Resh Lakish – his nostril fit inside the Arc.<br />

<br />
The reason of the Sages is clear – a temporarily blemished animal cannot be currently brought “before God,” but what is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? - He bases his opinion on the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">You shall not do everything we do today, each man what is proper in his eyes</a>.” The word “proper” means “proper in the eyes of the man who offers” now, and will become so in the eyes of God later - and it is this action that "you shall not do."<br />

One is also not liable for actions that are not the last step in the service, thus, for example, one is not liable for separating a handful from the flour-offering, but is liable for burning it. Likewise, one is not liable for receiving the blood, but is liable for throwing it on the altar.<br />
<br />
Initially sacrificial service was done by the firstborn, and everybody was allowed to build his private altar. This is mentioned in the Torah when it says, “<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/24-5.htm">And Moses sent the youths of the Children of Israel, and they brought up burnt offerings</a>.” The firstborn lost this privilege after they worshipped the Golden Calf, and the kohanim, the sons of Aaron, began to serve in their stead.<br />
<br />
Once the Tabernacle was erected, private altars became forbidden. When the Jews came Israel, crossed the Jordan, and erected the Tabernacle at Gilgal, near Jericho, private altars again became permitted. F</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">inally, t</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">hey became completely prohibited after the building of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br />

Zevachim 116 –  How to Bring Sacrifices on a Private Altar

This was still permitted to non-Jews after the Temple was built and the Jews had to bring their sacrifices there.<br />
<br />
Could the sacrifices brought on private altar be eaten as peace-offerings, or did they have to be burned, as burnt-offerings? Those who say that they could be eaten point out that “<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/4-4.htm">Abel brought from the firstlings of his flock and from their fats</a>...” - that is, he brought the fats but ate the rest. And those who say that Abel brought only burnt-offerings explain that he brought the fattest of the lambs and burned them completely.<br />
<br />
But didn't <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-12.htm">Jethro bring peace-offerings</a>? – Jethro came after the giving of the Torah, when eating sacrifices became allowed.<br />
<br />
What did Jethro <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-1.htm">hear that he came</a>? He heard about the splitting of the Red Sea. But why did Rahav say about it “<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/2-11.htm">No spirit remained <i>erect</i> in any man</a>” (hint)? – She knew, because there was no leader or ruler who did not come to her. She started at 10, was a prostitute for 40 years, and converted at 50.<br />

Corresponding to these, in the times of the Temple there were the Temple, the Temple Mount, and Jerusalem. <br />
<br />
Each area had its laws. A Metzora (spiritual leper) may not enter the Israelite camp, that is, Jerusalem at the time of the Temple, and the encampment at the time of the desert. An accidental murder was exiled to the Levite Camp, and in the time of the Temple, to one of the cities where the Levites lived. If a Levi murdered by accident, he had to be exiled to another Levite city, but if we moved from one neighborhood to another, this was sufficient. One who was ritually impure because of contact with a dead body could enter the Levite Camp (Temple Mount), but not the Temple proper.<br />

<br />
The days of the Tent of Meeting at Gilgal numbered 14 years: 7 during the conquest of the Land of Israel, and 7 years while the land was divided. We know this from the life of Calev, who was 40 when the spies were sent out, 78 when they crossed the Jordan, and 85 when the land was conquered. Since the land was being conquered for 7 years, we can assume that it was also divided for 7 years.<br />
<br />
The Tabernacle then stood in Shiloh for 369 years. In Nov and Giveon it stood for another 57 years, moving between these two places - and we know this from the lives of Eli the Priest and Samuel - until the Temple was built. <br />

When the Tabernacle stood either in Shiloh or Jerusalem, private altars were forbidden. However, before that, at Gilgal, and between these time period, when it stood in Nov and Giveon, private altars were permitted.<br />
<br />
According to Rabbi Yishmael, both “resting place” and “inheritance” refer to Shiloh, and no verse is needed to teach that private altars were permitted in between, because we find many righteous individual using them. According to Rabbi Shimon, both refer to Jerusalem, and private altars were always permitted before then.<br />
<br />
Private altar does not require leaning on the sacrifice, or the northern side of the altar, or application of blood all around the altar, or waving the offering, or bringing the flour offering to the southern corner of the altar. Rabbi Yehudah says that there are no flour offerings on a private altar.<br />

Bringing it as any other sacrifice makes it completely invalid.<br />
<br />
What happens if one changed two of these conditions: he brought it early, in the morning of the fourteenth, and for the sake of a different sacrifice (one can imagine that he rushed early in the morning, but then realized that it was too early and decided to bring it as a peace-offering).<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua considers this as if he brought it on the thirteenth, and as any Passover sacrifice brought outside its time as a different one, it is valid. Ben Beteira says that morning is like afternoon, and the sacrifice is invalid.<br />
<br />
Ben Azzai goes back to the </span><span style="font-size: medium;"> very first ruling of this Tractate and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> disagrees with it, saying, based on a tradition from the seventy-two members of the Sanhedrin,  that sacrifices that are eaten, if brought for a different type, are valid. This rule adds only the burnt offering to the invalid ones, but the Sages did not agree with him.<br />

However, there are three aspect in which they are the same. <br />
<br />
One is liable for the following on a private altar: if he eats the sacrifice beyond the allowed time; if one had a wrong intent to eat the sacrifice beyond allowed time, the sacrifice becomes invalid and one is liable for eating it; one is liable for eating it while being ritually impure.<br />
<br />
How do we know that? In fact, we might even think the opposite. The Torah stated <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-17.htm">that a sacrifice kept overnight is burned and one that goes out of the Temple is also burned</a>. &nbsp;Therefore I might think that since the sacrifice on the private altar already exited the Temple and was not burned, so too one that was left overnight is not burned! - Bird sacrifices disprove this, since they are less strict than the animal sacrifices, and they do become invalid with time. - Birds are no proof, because they require a kohen. To dispel all these arguments, the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-11.htm">This is the law of the peace offerings</a>” - to be applied both inside and outside the Temple.<br />

Now we learn that it is true not only for slaughter, but also for the other three steps of the sacrificial service: receiving the blood in the Temple vessel, walking with that blood to the Altar, and throwing it on the Altar. If any of these steps are done with the intention for a different sacrifice type, this makes the sacrifice invalid.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Tarfon was distressed that he had previously heard from his teacher that there is a difference between the laws of receiving blood and throwing it, but he could not remember what the difference was. Rabbi Akiva deduced three points of difference on his own - for example, if one receives the blood outside the Temple, he is not liable, but if he throws the blood on an altar outside the Temple, he is liable to excision.<br />
<br />
At this Rabbi Tarfon remembered that this was what he had learned and exclaimed, “Akiva, whoever parts from you is like one who parts from his life!”<br />

This is because walking is not a necessary step, and if the kohen is close enough to the Altar, walking may be altogether absent.<br />
<br />
Said Resh Lakish, “Rabbi Shimon agrees about those offerings that are slaughtered in the Courtyard and then carried inside the Temple Hall (such as Yom Kippur offerings) that the wrong intention does invalidate them – since this walking cannot be circumvented. <br />
<br />
Seeing that walking has somewhat lenient requirements, they asked Rav Chisda if it can be done by a non-kohen. Rav Chisda said that it can, quoting “<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/35-11.htm">and they slaughtered the Passover offering, and the kohanim threw the blood from their hands</a>” - it must be that the non-kohanim who slaughtered also walked with the blood! However, Rav Sheshet disproved this, and as far as the quote, he explained that the non-kohanim just stood like pillars but did not move at all.<br />

<br />
They tried to answer this question based on another rule: if a Kohen is sitting, he is disqualified from carrying the blood. It must be, therefore, that when he is standing, he can carry the blood! - No, because maybe by "sitting" the rule means moving by dragging himself in a sitting position. No proof can be deduced from here!<br />
<br />
They tried to answer the question from a different rule: on Passover, the sacrifice would be slaughtered by its owner, and a Kohen would receive the blood, pass it to his fellow, and so on until it reached the Altar. We see from here that one does not have to walk! - No, we don't see it - perhaps they moved a little. Then why were they many? The service of God is better with many.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan concluded, "Conveying the blood without moving one's feet is not a valid service."<br />

Since Aharon was specifically requested to continue the service after his two sons died, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/21-12.htm">And he need not leave the Sanctuary and he will not profane</a>...”, we understand that all other Kohanim would profane the service.<br />
<br />
Although the ruling above mentions only receiving the blood, the same disqualification also applies to the other two steps – carrying the blood and throwing it on the Altar. The slaughter, however, is valid if done by a non-Kohen, since the Torah said, “And he slaughters, and a Kohen receives the blood.”<br />

Still, <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/22-7.htm">some vestiges of ritual impurity linger until nightfall</a>. If he receives the blood of a sacrifice, he makes it invalid, because of a verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/21-6.htm">They shall be holy... and they shall not profane</a>.”  This verse is extra, and we apply it to the one who is partially impure.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
<i>One who lacks atonement</i>. Some special cases of impurity, such as spiritual leprosy (metzora) require purification in stages, the last stage being bringing the sacrifices. Until he has brought them, he invalidates the service. <br />
<br />
Why did the Torah have to teach both cases, if they are so closely related anyway? - Because each possesses its own stringency, so that the disqualification of one cannot be derived from the other. The “impure today” cannot eat the Kohen's portion, but the one who lacks atonement can. On the other hand, the one who lacks atonement needs a positive action, that is, bringing his sacrifices, whereas the one who is “impure today” only needs nightfall, which comes by itself. <br />

Since the Torah said that “<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/29-7.htm">You shall girdle them with sash and put turbans on them and the priesthood will be for them an eternal law</a>”, we see that when they have all the garments, they are considered priests, but if they lack some, they are considered strangers, and a stranger invalidates the service.<br />
<br />
If they have extra garments, the extra ones invalidate the service because the required garments should be “on the body” and not on other garments. If the garments are too long, too short, or fitting well but shortened by the belt, some say that they are valid, and some say that they are not. However, all agree that if they were too long (dragging) but were shortened by the belt to the desired size, that is fine.<br />

<br />
For a Kohen, a small bandage around a wound is forbidden, because it constitutes an extra garment. Another opinion is that an extra garment is only important in the place of garments, or on the right hand, which is used for service.<br />
<br />
Rava asked a series of questions. If the wind entered the Kohen's garment, does this invalidate the service because the garment is not “on his body,” or is it a normal manner of wearing? Does a louse constitute interposition between the kohen's body and the garment? The dead one certainly does, but what about a live one? Since it comes and goes, it is like a growth on his body, or, since he does not like it, it is an interposition? What about the dust of the earth, a hand in his bosom, or thread hanging from the garment?<br />

However, if one slaughtered them for a wrong designation, they are still valid and the ritual can continue – only they are not counted to fulfill the owner's obligation, so that he has to bring another one.<br />
<br />
Exceptions to this rule are a Pesach sacrifice brought on Passover, and a sin-offering. These two, if slaughtered not for their own sake, are completely invalid.<br />
<br />
Ravina said to Rav Pappa, “It's a pity that you were not within Shabbat boundary and could not come to us Friday night, for Rava asked a great question and resolved it.” What was it?<br />
<br />
Rava found this contradiction: the sacrifice is not counted if slaughtered for a “wrong designation,” but if there is no designation, it is valid. A woman's Get, on the other hand, has to be written expressly for her, but if there is no designation, it is invalid. And he answered: a sacrifice, without a designation, is intended for its sake, but a woman, if not otherwise specified, will continue to be married, and does no intend to be divorced.<br />

Otherwise, his service is invalid.<br />
<br />
Rav Assi could not understand the difference between this washing and the ten washings of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, which accompany his five changes of garments - since they do <i>not</i> invalidate the service. Rabbi Yochanan explained to him that the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/16-4.htm">and then don them</a>" tells us that the garments are essential, but washing is not. Rav Assi's face lit up. But his joy was premature, because Rabbi Yochanan then said, "and by the same token the morning washing should not be significant."<br />
<br />
Even if a Kohen was offering animal limbs on the Altar all night, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that he needs to wash them again at dawn, but Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Shimon says that he does not need to repeat the washing even if he serves for ten days in a row.<br />
<br />
If a Kohen steps out of the Temple, does he need to repeat the washing on return, because he took his mind off the service, or does he not, because he can choose to return any time? No decision is reached.<br />

<br />
Could they to instead dip their hands and feet into the vessel? Can we derive the answer from another rule: if a kohen dipped his hands and feet in a mikvah, he still needs to sanctify them from the vessel. Can we conclude that it is only after a mikvah that he needs another sanctification? - Not necessarily, maybe dipping in the vessel is also ineffective.<br />
<br />
Then why not state this rule about the vessel, and we will deduce the rule about the mikvah? Because you might have thought that, since one can ritually bathe the whole body in the mikvah, how much more so he is allowed to dip just hands and feet! Therefore, the rule tells you otherwise.<br />

It had twelve spouts to avoid lines. The water in the Kiyor could come from any source, according to one opinion, but according to another, it had to come from a spring.<br />
<br />
If the water in the Kiyor remained there overnight, it become invalid and had to be replaced. Therefore, they used to lower the Kiyor into a mikvah, with the help of a wheel, just before daybreak, and according to other opinions, at more time periods during the night.<br />
<br />
Any Temple vessel could also be used for sanctifying the Kohen's hands and feet, but a regular non-sacrificial vessel could not. Why? Let's try to prove this by comparison with the copper base, in which the Kiyor stood.  Since this base could not be used for washing the Kohen's hands and feet, even though it was a Temple vessel, isn't  it true that a regular vessel surely could not be used? - No! The base is not made for storing water at all! Rather, this is derived from the word that the Torah used - “from it” - and not from other vessels!<br />

This is true even if he had a valid reason not to be circumcised, such as if his brothers had died on account of circumcision.<br />
<br />
In addition, any Kohen who is "estranged from his Father in Heaven," that is, who turned away from Torah observance, should not serve in the Temple, and if he does, his sacrifices are invalid. This is learned from the phrase in Ezekiel, "Uncircumcised in flesh and uncircumcised in heart". A questions was asked - and before Ezekiel ben Buzi, did the estranged Kohanim serve in the Temple? Of course not! Then how can we learn a new law from a prophet? We know that Moses taught all the laws the Torah, and they were not changed! - Yes, Moses taught it, but it was an oral tradition, until Ezekiel came and wrote it down.<br />
<br />
Any kohen who is ritually impure invalidates the service. This is true only of impurity caused by a dead dead animal, such as a rat, but the impurity of a human corpse, since it is permitted under some circumstances, does not invalidate the service. Additionally, a Kohen who performs service while sitting invalidates the sacrifices. <br />

It was indeed necessary to give all three examples. If we only knew about a utensil, we could have thought that it invalidates the service because it is not flesh. And if we knew only about an animal, we could have said, that is because it is not human flesh. Therefore, the rule in fact taught all three prohibitions.<br />
<br />
If the Kohen stood with one foot on a vessel and another one on the Temple floor – we analyze the situation: if the vessel can be removed and the Kohen would still remain standing, the service is valid.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ami asked, if one stone was removed and the Kohen stood in the hole, what is the law? Given that King David sanctified both the upper level of the floor and the lower, the soil can serve as the floor, but is it proper to do the service that way? The question remained unanswered.<br />

The term “the bull” implies that the blood of the very essence of the bull, that is, its lifeblood, should be received.<br />
<br />
The blood of the skin is that blood which is drawn from the animal's body with the initial cutting of the skin, before the inner organs are severed. The remnant blood is the blood that trickles out before and after the lifeblood. Neither can be used for sacrificial service.<br />
<br />
The Kohen should receive the blood in a service vessel directly from the bull's neck. If the blood first spilled on the floor, and afterwards the Kohen gathered it up, it is invalid.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Assi asked Rabbi Yochanan a question, “If one was receiving blood, and the bottom of the bowl gave way before the blood reached the airspace of the bowl, is it valid?” Rabbi Yochanan explained that if the bowl was defective and destined to fall apart, the blood is not considered resting in it, but if it was good – then the blood is considered received even before it reached the space inside the bowl.<br />

For example, the most holy offerings were slaughtered in the northern part of the Temple courtyard. If the Kohen stood in the southern part, stretched his arm into the northern part and performed the slaughter, it is valid. On the other hand, if he received the blood while standing in the southern part, the sacrifice is invalid.<br />
<br />
The father of Shmuel asked his son a question, “If one suspended an offering in the air and slaughtered it, what is the law?” Shmuel said that it was valid. “Wrong!” - said the father, since the slaughter has to be “At the side” of the Altar, not above. Next question, “What if the slaughterer was suspended in the air?” “It is invalid!” - answered Shmuel. “Wrong!” - said the father, slaughter should be “At the side,” not that the slaughterer should be “at the side.”<br />
<br />
The Altar was 10 cubits (20 feet) high, and a red line marked the separation between the upper and the lower halves. The blood of most offerings was applied to the lower half; only the blood of the sin-offering and of the bird burnt-offering was applied at the upper half – ideally at the “horns” on top.<br />

Zevachim 27 – If the Blood was Applied in the Wrong Place

<br />
There are many ways to understand this rule. Shmuel said that although the sacrifice is invalid, its owners still receive atonement, based on the phrase, “And I gave you and Altar for atonement”, implying all of the Altar. But one may ask that if so, the meat should also be eaten! - Shmuel understands “For atonement” only, not for other purposes.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish agrees with Shmuel if the Kohen applied the blood silently, but if he announced a wrong intent, it is completely invalid. Still, it does not qualify for being cut off.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan says that applying the blood in the wrong place does not count at all.<br />

Zevachim 28 – When is the Sacrifice Rejected

If one slaughters a sacrifice with the intent to throw its blood outside of the prescribed area, or even if he plans to throw a small part of the blood outside the prescribed area, the sacrifice becomes invalid – even if later he applies the blood in the correct place. The same is true if he intends to eat the sacrifice outside of prescribed area.<br />
<br />
However, if the wrong intent relates to time, that is, if he plans to throw its blood tomorrow, even a small part of the blood; if he intends to burn the sacrificial parts the next day, or to eat its meat the next day – the sacrifice becomes completely rejected (“piggul”) - and one who eats of its meat can be cut off from his people. This is true even if does not fulfill his intent and later does everything in the right time.<br />

Zevachim 29 – Rava Masterfully Explains a Long Verse

But why is this? Rava provides an explanation from a certain lengthy verse which starts with “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/19-7.htm">If any of will be consumed on the third day</a>...”.  Unlike others before him, Rava considers the verse in its entirety and derives many additional laws from it.<br />
<br />
“Will be consumed at all” teaches that the laws of invalidation are the same for consumption by man and by the Altar (burning on it). “On the third day” teaches the invalidation produced by intention to eat the sacrifice beyond its alloted time. “The one that offers” teaches that the invalidation occurs through the wrong intention of the one that offers, and that it does not occur, even retroactively, if the sacrifice is actually eaten on the third day. "The soul that eats it" teaches that one soul is punished, but not two souls, that is, only the intention "outside its time" leads to rejection, but not the intention "outside its place."<br />

Zevachim 3 – He Noted a Contradiction and Resolved It

We see from here that the intent for another offering invalidates the sin offering, but the intent for something that is not an offering at all does not have any adverse effect.<br />
<br />
On the other hand a Get, written not for the sake of one's wife, but for the sake of a different women (provided that they have the same names) is invalid. Even if it is written for the sake of an idolatress, to whom the laws of Jewish marriage do not apply, the Get is still invalid. Thus, in the case of Get the intent for something completely different does invalidate it. Why is this difference?<br />
<br />
He answered that in the case of divorce, if one takes the idolatress out of the picture, this Get is not intended for his wife and is thus invalid, but with sacrifices, if you take the intent for non-sacrificial meat out of the picture, it becomes no intent at all, and such sacrifices are valid.<br />

Zevachim 30 – Two Invalidations Invalidate Each Other

For example, if while receiving the blood, one had an intent to eat the sacrifice beyond allotted time, it becomes rejected – but only if the other services were done with the correct intent. Another condition for rejection is that one should also plan to eat those parts that are normally eaten, and burn those that are normally burned. However, if on the subsequent step of the service he had an wrong intent to continue outside the allowed place – the two intentions clash, and the invalidation does not happen.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that in the case where the more serious disqualification “outside of permitted time” occurred first, later wrong intent does not matter.<br />

<br />
We can learn the answer from what Levi asked of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. Levi asked, “If one plans to eat a piece tomorrow in the wrong place, what is the law?” Previously Rabbi Yehudah taught other students two versions, with “and” and without, so they knew the answer. Levi, however, got only one version, without “and,” so he devised the question that would tell him both answers. If Rabbi Yehudah is annoyed, it means that Levi could have found the answer himself and that Levi's version was the correct one. But Rabbi Yehudah answered calmly, “It is a mixture of thoughts.” Now Levi knew both the answer to his question and that “a piece and a piece” was the correct version.<br />

This is based on the phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-5.htm">He shall slaughter the bull before God and the sons of Aaron, the Kohanim, shall bring the blood to the Altar and throw it on the Altar</a>.” From here we see only beginning from the second step of the service – receiving the blood – do we require a Kohen, but anybody can do the slaughter.<br />
<br />
Thus, every non-Kohen, man or woman, or even an impure person is qualified to do the slaughter.  Therefore, the thought of anyone who does the slaughter counts, and if they intend to eat the sacrifice beyond the allotted time, the sacrifice becomes rejected. <br />
<br />
A ritually impure person faces a special problem: he should take care not to make the meat of the sacrifice impure. He has to either have the level of impurity that cannot be transmitted through the knife, or he has to use a sharp reed, which, as a flat wooden object, does not transmit impurity. Additionally, he has to stand outside the Courtyard and use a very long knife.<br />

However, it used the language of touching to tell us that touching and entry have the same law: just as touching is always partial – that is, done with the fingers and not with the whole body – so too partial entry is considered an entry.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Hoshaya challenged Ulla using the law of a leper (metzorah) who puts his fingers inside the courtyard to be anointed with special oil at the end of his purification. Although Ulla answered the challenge, Ravina rephrased Ulla's statement as talking about lashes and not, as we have assumed, about a more strict excision.<br />
<br />
When Ravin came from Israel, he said that Resh Lakish's ruling was indeed stated about touching, not about entering the Courtyard, and in fact, the disagreement ran as follows. Resh Lakish said that an impure person who touches sacrificial food incurs lashes, while Rabbi Yochanan said he does not.<br />

However, if they have continued and received the blood, then the law is as follows: if there is some lifeblood spurting from the neck of the animal, a qualified person should receive the blood and complete the service.<br />
<br />
If a qualified person received the blood and handed it to a disqualified person, the latter should simply return the blood, and the service continues. If the kohen received the blood with his right hand, but then put the vessel in his left hand – he should return it to his right hand and continue. If the blood spilled on the floor and he gathered it – it is valid.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish asked Rabbi Yochanan, “What if the disqualified person not only received the blood, but also threw it on the Altar, can this be corrected?”  Rabbi Yochanan answered, “Yes. Unless he intended to eat it in the wrong place or beyond the right time, because then it became  rejected.”<br />

But why should this be possible? We have a principle that a sacrifice that has become temporarily  rejected is rejected forever. For example, if on Yom Kippur one of the two goats died, the second one can never be re-used, even after we bring another goat.<br />
<br />
The answer is that either the Sage who authored the rule does not subscribe to the principle of "once rejected - forever rejected", or that a rejection that can be rectified by our hands - like in this case, where a fit person can take over - is not considered a rejection at all.<br />
<br />
If, while slaughtering the sacrifice, one has a wrong intent about eating, and plans to eat in the wrong place or after allotted time - but what he plans to eat is not usually edible, such as the hide, or is not really the meat of the sacrifice, such as the gravy, or he plans to eat less than an olive's volume - the sacrifice remains valid.<br />

Zevachim 36 – Kohen Plans to Keep the Meat For Later

What would be the law if one only intended to leave it over, but did not think of eating it? Rabbi Yehudah invalidates the offering, but the Sages declare it fit. <br />
<br />
We can very well understand the opinion of the Sages: only what the Torah rejected – that is, the intent to eat the meat of the sacrifice too late – only that is rejected, but why does Rabbi Yehudah declare it invalid? Rabbi Yehudah says that the Torah has stated the prohibition of eating the meat beyond its time twice. Since the repetition is not needed for its own sake, it teaches us an additional invalidation, namely, our case of intending to leave the sacrifice over.<br />
<br />
If he had other unusual intentions, such as to apply the blood at the wrong height of the Altar, inside the Sanctuary instead of next to the Altar in the Courtyard, or it was a Passover offering, and he intended to eat it unroasted – in all these cases the sacrifice remains valid.<br />

Zevachim 37 – Blood Service of Sacrifices

For the majority of offerings,  the blood has to be thrown from a vessel twice, each time on the lower part of each of the two opposing corners. As the blood is dashed on the corner, it spreads out on the adjacent sides, so that with two applications the blood falls on all four walls. This is called “two applications that are four.”<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai say that if a Kohen performed only one throwing of the blood, the offerings is valid. Although the second throwing is obligatory, it is not essential for the validity of the offering. In the case of a  sin offering, where four applications are initially required, the first two make the offering valid. Beit Hillel disagree in the last case and say that even for a sin offering the first application already makes the offering valid.<br />
<br />
Therefore, all agree that the Kohen's intent during the first blood application is what counts, and if he intended to consume the offering beyond allotted time, the offering is rejected. If he had a wrong intent during the second blood application, the offering remains valid.<br />

Zevachim 38 – Is Written or Pronounced Word More Important?

All agree that four applications are required, but Beit Shammai say that the offering is already valid after two such applications, while Beit Hillel maintain that even one is sufficient.<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai rely on the phrase “on the horns” <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-25.htm">repeated</a> <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-30.htm">three</a> <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-34.htm">times</a>. Since the minimum of the plural “horns” is two, altogether this counts as  six. Four of these six teach the prescribed procedure, and the remaining two tell how many are absolutely necessary. Beit Shammai rely on the pronounced form of the word “horns”.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Beit Hillel point out that the written form for two of the three “horns” can be read as “one horn”. Beit Hillel attach more importance to the written form of the word. This gives them four “horns”, three for the prescribed after the first application, and one that is necessary for atonement. But Beit Hillel's count is inconsistent, they should use all four for the prescribed application, with none necessary to achieve atonement! They answer that we don't nowhere do we find atonement for nothing. <br />

These sacrifices included the bull of the sin-offering of the High Priest who sinned inadvertently, the he-goat for communal idolatry, and the bull and the he-goat brought on Yom Kippur.<br />
<br />
For these sacrifices all four blood applications were essential, and if the Kohen omitted one of them, he has not effected atonement. However, since all four applications thus work as  a group, if the Kohen had the “beyond alloted time” intent during one of them, he has made the sacrifice invalid, but not to the point of rejection, and one who eats its meat does not incur being cut off from the people.<br />
<br />
From where do we know this law?  The Torah said, “He shall do to the blood of the communal-error bull as he would do to the blood of the bull of the High Priest.” This phrase was unnecessary, and thus it teaches an additional law, that all blood applications are essential.<br />

Each of the four services has to be done for the sake of the sacrifice – that is, the one who is doing the service needs to keep in mind, and not declare otherwise, that he is doing this service for the peace offering, burnt offering, etc.<br />
<br />
How do we know it? The Torah said, “And if his slaughter is for the sake of peace offering.” You could argue and say that the Torah needs to specify that it is a peace offering, and not something else. To that the answer is that the Torah already called it a peace offering in “one carries the blood of the peace offering.” What does it teach then by saying “his slaughter is for the sake?” - that it needs to be for the sake of the specific offering.<br />
<br />
The “for the sake” requirement for other services is derived from similar verses. There is also an analogous requirement “for the sake of the owner of the sacrifice.”<br />

How do we know that these seven sprinklings were essential, and leaving out one of them would make the service invalid? - Because seven applications in all other places had this quality. And which are they? - The seven sprinklings of the preparation of the red heifer, and the seven sprinklings required for the purification of a spiritual leper.<br />
<br />
How do we know that the four applications to the “horns” of the Inner Altar are also essential? - From the verse “so shall he do.” This is an additional repetition of the requirement to do the prescribed service. Since we derived on the basis of the first repetition that the seven sprinklings toward the curtain are essential, we may derive from this repetition that the four applications to the horn are also essential.<br />

Namely, when talking about a communal-error offering, which is brought when the High Court renders serious erroneous decision and many Jews follow it, the Torah does not discuss all the details, such as burning of the diaphragm and of the two kidneys. These details are mentioned when describing the similar individual offering of a High Priest, and one is learned from the other. <br />
<br />
But why did the Torah have to conceal and only hint at the details? This is similar to a king who became angry at his beloved friend, but minimized the mention of his offense in the official records, because of endearment. In the same vein, when talking about a communal he-goat brought for the sin of idolatry, there is an even more-pronounced abbreviation, and the details of the service are not mentioned at all.<br />

In the case of a flour offering the “permitter” is burning a handful of its flour together with oil and frankincense included in it, on the Altar. Some say that the wrong intention during half of the "permitter" already rejects the offering, and some say that it does not.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">In addition, we want to know, what is the reason behind the disagreement in the following rule, and whether it is “half of the permitter” or something else: If the Kohen had the wrong intention of “beyond allotted time” while burning the frankincense but not the oil – then Rabbi Meir says that the offering becomes rejected, but the Sages say that it does not. Is this an example of the “half the permitter” disagreement? Resh Lakish said that it is not. Rather, the Kohen had the wrong intent at first, but then forgot about it – and Rabbi Meir says that his first intention continues, but the Sages say that it stops.<br />

The permitter itself can never become rejected, only the permitted part of the sacrifice can.<br />
<br />
For example, if the Kohen, while receiving the blood, intends to eat the meat of the sacrifice beyond the allotted time, the meat becomes rejected right away, and whoever eats it, deserves to be cut off from the people. The blood itself, however, does not become rejected.<br />
<br />
Other permitters that do not become rejected include the handful of flour separated by the Kohen from the flour offering, and its frankincense. The flour offering of a Kohen is never rejected because it is completely burned and has no permitter. The same is true for the flour offering of the High Priest, which is brought daily, half in the morning and half in the evening.<br />
<br />
But, how can this rule even work for a flour offering that is completely burnt? If it has no permitter, when can the Kohen have the wrong intention? - While carrying the offering to the Altar.<br />

However, how do we know that? The Torah only hints at this law, and even that only in the context of peace-offering. <br />
<br />
Here is the relevant passage, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-18.htm">If some of the meat-offering of his peace-offering will be consumed at all on the third day...it shall be rejected</a>” and the person who eats it will be cut off from the people.<br />
<br />
We have <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/12/zevachim-29-rava-masterfully-explains.html">already learned that this verse is talking about the intention to eat on the third day, not the real eating on the third day</a> – since the meat becomes rejected right away, which can only happen as a result of his intention.<br />
<br />
However, how do we know that this law equally applies to other sacrifices, and not only to those that are similar to peace-offering, which would include just first-born and tithe? - From the extra word “of the meat” we learn that it applies to all sacrifices that are eaten. What about sacrifices that are not eaten, like the burnt-offering? - This is learned from the extra “offering” in the word combination “meat-offering.”<br />

More specifically, they can consecrate voluntary offerings or offerings in fulfillment of a personal vow, and bring them to the Temple for sacrifice. This is the derived from the verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/22-18.htm">Any man (even an idolater) who will bring his offering for any of their vows, or their  voluntary offerings to God for a burn offering</a>...” It is a matter of dispute (which will be discussed 148 days from now)  whether they can consecrate only a burnt offering are any voluntary offering, such as peace- or thanksgiving-offering.<br />
<br />
However, because most of the offerings laws of sacrifices include the term “sons of Israel”, the non-Jewish are excluded from some stringencies. Thus, if a Kohen, while slaughtering the sacrifice, intends that its meat will be eaten beyond the allotted time, then, even though the sacrifice becomes invalid, eating its meat does not carry the usual penalty of being cut off from the people. The same applies to the leftover meat which was left beyond its time, and to eating it in the state of ritual impurity. These are the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yose, however, holds a person liable to the usually penalty for all these actions.<br />

Zevachim 46 – Exceptions to the Exceptions for the Laws of Rejection

For example, the blood of the sacrifice itself (the "permitter") does not becomes rejected even if the kohen had the wrong, “beyond allotted time,” intent. However, these substances may carry other penalties.<br />
<br />
The blood is forbidden to be consumed in any case. Furthermore, one is liable if he eats the substances as “leftovers” or if he eats them while being ritually impure, and for that he still gets the penalty of being cut off from the people. “Leftovers” designate any sacrifice that is eaten beyond its allotted time. Consuming blood is also forbidden under the penalty of being cut off, but one does not get an additional penalty if he eats it as “leftovers” or while being impure.<br />
<br />
What is the practical difference? One is “cut off” from Heaven, thus, being “cut off” more than once is left to Heaven to decide. However, if one, for example, eats blood inadvertently, he is liable to bring a sin-offering, and there may be more than one sin-offering, if he commits a transgression bearing multiple penalties.<br />

Even if the Kohen did not have any of these intentions in mind, it is still valid, and therefore the Court decreed that the Kohanim should say nothing at all, because they have the power to ruin things.<br />
<br />
Now we begin to study the proper places for sacrificial services. All most holy offerings are slaughtered to the north of the Altar. The first ones on this list are the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur service – their slaughter is to the north of the Altar, and their blood should be received in the service vessel to the north of the Altar.  <br />

<br />
The Torah mentioned the north requirement in connection with the burnt offering. Why did the teacher not list this first? Because this requirement for the sin-offering was derived using the rules of Torah exposition, and as such, it was more beloved to him. The teacher used it to sharpen the minds of his students.<br />
<br />
What is this derivation? "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-25.htm">In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin-offering be slaughtered</a>." <br />

But if the Kohen went ahead and slaughtered it in the South, is it valid? In other words, is this requirement "before" or even "after?" <br />
<br />
Can we say this: since the sin-offering must be slaughtered in the North, and its laws are learnt from the laws of the burnt offering, then of course the burnt offering must be in the North - for we never find that a derived law is stronger than the basic one!<br />
<br />
No, we can't really say it. Take, for example, the second tithe, which may be redeemed for money, but after it was redeemed once, it cannot be redeemed again - which is stronger! - Wrong! The sanctity of second redemption is weaker, not stronger, and that's why it cannot be redeemed.<br />
<br />
Another attempt: take the Passover offering, which does not require libations, but if it is brought after Passover, it does require them! So the second time around it is stronger! - Wrong! It simply becomes a peace offering which requires libations.<br />
<br />
We have deflected all attacks, but anyway we have a better proof, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-29.htm">in the place of the burnt offering</a>" tells us that the burnt offering should stay in its place.<br />

But that is not logical! If the 'for the sake of' requirement is important, the sacrifice should be altogether invalid. And if it is not that important, it should count toward the owner's obligation!"<br />
<br />
He found the answer in the Torah phrase, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-23.htm">What emerges from your lips you shall observe and carry out, just as you vowed... a freewill offering</a>." A freewill offering (nedavah) means that one promises to bring a sacrifice, but not a specific animal. On the other hand, a vow (“neder”) occurs when one points to an animal and promises to bring that specific animal. <br />
<br />
Why does the Torah call it both a vow and a freewill offering? - To tell you that if you did as you vowed, and brought the offering for its sake, you have fulfilled your vow. But if you brought it not for its sake, then it becomes a freewill offering, additional to your vow; it is brought and is valid, but it does not fulfill your vow obligation.<br />

The rules are “same aspect,” “same word,” a fortiori logic, and a general rule. There are thus 4 rules and 16 possible combinations of them, and the Talmud considers all 16 to see if they can combine.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the “same aspect” rule. If the Torah compared two situations and said, “just as...so is” - then this is the “same aspect” rule, and we can learn the laws of one from the other. However, the “same aspect” derivations cannot be chained. If something is learned by comparison of its aspect to another, it cannot turn around and teach us other laws. Why not? We see this from the following situation: the Torah compared sin offering to burnt offering; it also compared a guilt offering to a sin offering. One would expect that we can make this chain deduction: sin offering is similar to burnt offering, guilt offering is similar to a sin offering, therefore guilt offering is similar to burnt offering. However, Torah explicitly taught the comparison of guilt offering to burnt offering, to teach us that the “same aspect” rules are not transitive.<br />

These include the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur, the communal-error bull, and the communal-idolatry goat. <br />
<br />
What is the reason the Kohen  would pour this blood in that particular place, and what is the Torah source for this? The verse states, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-7.htm">And all the remnant of the blood of the bull he shall pour onto the base of the burnt-offering Altar, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</a>.” The burnt-offering Altar is the “Outer Altar”, positioned in Temple Courtyard. The “Tent of the Meeting” was designated the inner Hall of the Tabernacle while it traveled in the desert, and then this term was transfered to the Temple Hall.<br />
<br />
Which part of the Altar  does the Kohen encounter first when he exits the Temple Hall? The western part. Since the rule is that one may not pass up the opportunity to do a mitzva, even in order to do another one, he pours out the blood right there.<br />

The blood of burnt offerings was thrown on this base, that is, on its top flat part, or above it, on the Altar's wall. How do we know this?<br />
<br />
The Torah writes, “onto the base of the burnt-sacrifice Altar.” From the extra word “Altar” we understand that the blood is to be thrown on the top of the base, which is similar to the roof (top) of the Altar.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ishmael says that the verse is not needed for this, and that it can be derived by logic: if the remnant of the blood of the sin offering, which, being the remnant, does not atone for anything, is poured on the base, then certainly the first application of the blood of the burnt offering, which does atone, definitely needs the base.<br />
<br />
Then what does rabbi Ishmael do with the verse, since he derives his law without it? He uses it to expand the law about the base to all other types of sacrifices.<br />

<br />
The blood of sin-offerings requires four applications on the four horns of the Outer Altar. At each corner on top of the Altar there was a cube-shaped “horn.” The Kohen would start on the ramp leading up the Altar, but then turn to the right and step on the ledge which surrounded the Altar at the hight of 6 ells. In this the Kohen followed the rule of “if you have a choice of two roads, take the one to the right.” He would then continue on the ledge around the Altar, going counter-clockwise, and apply the blood with his finger to each of the horns.<br />

Together with the other most holy offerings it possesses the following stringencies: if one uses it for personal benefit, even before slaughter, he has misappropriated of Temple property and needs atonement. Its meat becomes invalidated if taken outside the Temple Courtyard. <br />
<br />
Its slaughter is in the north of the Altar, and the reception of its blood must also be in the north, using a service vessel. Its blood requires two applications that are equivalent to four – that is, it is applied to two corners of the Altar diagonally across from each other, in such a way that it reaches both sides of each corner. Thus, applications to the two corners suffice to place the blood an all four sides of the Altar. This is also described "as a Greek letter Gamma," which in  upper case forms a right angle.<br />
<br />
It requires skinning and dismemberment, after which it is consigned in its entirety to the fires, that is, burnt on the Altar.<br />
<br />
The place of the Temple was figured out by King David and the prophet Shmuel while David was hiding from Saul. They followed the book of Joshua, which called for the highest place in Israel. <br />

<br />
The thanksgiving offering is holy, but not the most holy: it can be slaughtered anywhere in the Courtyard, it may be eaten anywhere in Jerusalem, by any person, for the day of the offering and the following night. Special portions of it are given to the kohanim and their families.<br />
<br />
Peace offerings are similar holy offerings, but can be eaten for an additional day.<br />

Zevachim 56 – The Area for Slaughter, the Time for Blood

<br />
Most holy offerings must be eaten, and the peace offerings must be slaughtered “in front of the Tent of the Meeting.” In order to make the whole area of the Courtyard “in front,” there were additional doors, on the opposite far sides of the Hall, leading into the Hall.<br />
<br />
The blood of the sacrifices had to be offered before sunset. After sunset it became disqualified, because of the verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-16.htm" id="link_3">on the day that he offers his sacrifice it shall be eaten</a>.” This teaches that both the slaughter and the offering of the blood must occur on the same day.<br />

Zevachim 57 – First-born, Tithe, and Passover Sacrifices

The first-born offering is a male offspring of a cow, sheep or goat; it is given to a Kohen, who offers it as a sacrifice. The animal tithe is taken each year from the newborns of the herds and flocks. Each tenth animal is designated as the tithe one, and then the owner takes it to Jerusalem, brings it as  a sacrifice, and eats it there, together with his family and friends. <br />
<br />
These offerings are slaughtered anywhere in the Courtyard, and their blood requires only one application on the Altar, provided that it is done against the foundation. The foundation is the one-cubit step at the bottom of the Altar; it ran along the western and northern sides, plus another cubit to the east and to the south sides.<br />
<br />
The Passover offering is special in that it is eaten only at night until midnight, only by those who have registered beforehand, and only roasted.<br />
<br />
One who desires to reach God is called "the firstborn", and one deep feeling of this is sufficient, provided that it is sincere - that is, done against the foundation (the very depth) of the heart.<br />

However, what would happen if a sacrifice were to be slaughtered on the actual top of the Altar? Rabbi Yose says that the sacrifice is valid as if it were slaughtered in the north of the Courtyard. Rabbi Yose ben Yehudah says that from the middle of the Altar and southward is the same as the south of the Courtyard, and from the middle and northward is the same as the north of the Courtyard.<br />
<br />
What is the rationale for the opinion of Rabbi Yose? There is in fact a disagreement as to where exactly the Altar stood in the Courtyard, and Rabbi Yose is of the opinion that it stood completely in the north. If so, let Rabbi Yose say this directly, why did he use the words “as if it were slaughtered in the north?” Rabbi Yose wants to pre-empt your question, for you might say, that since the Torah requires “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-11.htm">at the side of the Altar</a>,” then perhaps on top of the Altar is not valid – and Rabbi Yose tells you that nevertheless it is valid.<br />

Zevachim 59 – Sacrifice Rejection, Damaged Altar

It cannot become valid again, even after the Altar is repaired.<br />
<br />
However, Rav commented on the reverse situation, “If  the Altar became damaged, all sacrifices that were slaughtered there are disqualified, and there is a verse for that, but we have forgotten it.” When Rav Kahana went to Babylon, he heard Rabbi Shimon teaching the verse that states “On the Altar you will slaughter your burnt offerings...” But, he asked, you are not slaughtering them ON the Altar, but at its side, so what does it mean? That your offerings are valid only when the Altar is complete. Said Rav Kahana, “That is the teaching that slipped away from Rav!”<br />
<br />
How large was the Outer Altar that Moses built? It was 10 by 10 cubits, and 3 cubits high – according to Rabbi Yehudah, but according to Rabbi Yose it was 5 by 5, with a height of 10. And how large was the Outer Altar in the Temple? It was 30 by 30 cubits, with a height of 10. <br />

It can atone even for multiple such transgression.<br />
<br />
A question was asked, can it atone for those transgressions that happened after it was designated by the owner? Since it can atone for multiple prior violations, maybe it can also atone for future ones? Or should we compare it to the sin offering? The sin offering is brought for a specific occurrences of a violation, for example, for violating Shabbat by mistake. It cannot atone for multiple transgressions, and of course it cannot it atone for future ones. If the burnt offering is like the sin offering, then it cannot atone for what happened after it was designated.<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries to prove that the burnt offering indeed atones for the future, by comparing it to various other slight offenses, but in each attempt there is possibly another mechanism of how the atonement for this offense works, so in the end the Talmud does not resolve the question.<br />

Rabbi Yose opts to derive the dimensions of the Outer Altar of Moses from his Inner Altar, because both were portable, while  Rabbi Yehudah compares the Outer Altar of Moses with the Outer Altar in the vision of Ezekiel.<br />
<br />
This leads them to other differences: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the floor of the Courtyard was sacred, and offerings could be burned directly on it; <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-59-sacrifice-rejection-damaged.html">they differ on the size of the Altar</a>; the height of the curtains around the Altar was five cubits according to Rabbi Yehudah, and fifteen cubits according to Rabbi Yose - because the Altar of Rabbi Yose was that much higher.<br />
<br />
But we have a rule that the laws of the Torah cannot be derived from the Prophets, such as Ezekiel! - True, and we use the words of Ezekiel only to define what the Torah means when it says that the Altar was five by five cubits.<br />

Said Rabbi Yirmiyah, “Stupid Babylonians! Because they live in a dark land, they say a teaching that darkens!” The answer, he said, was found in the following simple ruling.<br />
<br />
When the Tabernacle was  dismantled, the offerings were immediately disqualified. This refers to the most holy offerings. Furthermore, offerings can be eaten in two places, both in place of encampment and while traveling. This must refer to the regular holy offerings. Thus, the most holy offerings cannot be eaten without the Altar, but the regular ones can!<br />
<br />
However, Abaye found for himself support from a different teaching: Rabbi Ishmael says that the offerings cannot be eaten without the Altar, but the Sages says that they can – and Abaye follows the view of Rabbi Ishmael!<br />
<br />
Alternatively, said Abaye, the “second place” where even the most holy offerings can be eaten is the time when the Levites took down the curtains. You might think that having no curtains is the same as taking the meat outside the Courtyard. It's not! - and you may eat the sacrifices without the Temple standing.<br />

One testified about the size of the Altar, another - about the position of the Altar, and the third one testified that they may offer sacrifices on the Altar, even though the Temple was not built yet.”<br />
<br />
Therefore some say that <a href="http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/1536">sacrifices can be brought even nowadays</a>. The opponents say that we would be missing not only the Temple, but also many other details for which we need a prophet.<br />
<br />
The Altar had a ramp leading to it; the ramp was in the south, while the Altar was in the north. Why? Compare this to a person lying face down, whose thigh (Altar) is in the north, and his head (the ramp) will have to be in the south, following the verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-11.htm">He shall slaughter it at the side (literally, thigh) of the Altar, in the north</a>.”<br />
<br />
Alternatively,  the ramp is in the south so that the first turn the Kohen takes is to the right, and all turns a person takes should be to the right.<br />

It required a service called “kemitzah”: the kohen would scoop the flour or wafer pieces with his middle three fingers, then break off protruding pieces, using the thumb and the little finger, and burn this portion on the Altar. The kemitzah is analogous to slaughter in the case of the animal sacrifice. The leftovers are prepared in any manner (only that they should not leaven and become chametz), and are eaten by the kohanim in any place of the Courtyard, for a day and the following night until midnight.<br />
<br />
The bird sin-offering would be brought at the southwest corner of the Altar. This corner served for three things at the lower half (below the red line) and for three things above the red line. The three things below were the bird sin-offering, flour offering, and pouring the remnants of the blood. The three things above were wine libation, water libation, and bird burnt-offering – when there were too many kohanim on the east side of the Altar.<br />

While all animal offerings are slaughtered with a knife, a bird is killed by piercing the back of its neck with the right thumbnail of a Kohen. This type of slaughter, called “melikah,” is valid only for bird offerings in the Temple. The Kohen must take care not to separate the head of the bird from its body. Then he would sprinkle some of the bird's blood upon the Altar at the southwest corner, and the remainder of the blood must be squeezed onto the base of the Altar. The meat of the bird is eaten by the Kohanim.<br />
<br />
For the bird burnt-offering, the Kohen first ascends the ramp, then goes on the surrounding ledge, and arrives at the southeast corner. There he kills the bird in the same way (melikah), and may separate the head from the body. He squeezes out its blood on the wall of the Altar, saturates the head of the bird with salt, and burns it on the Altar. Then he throws the crop and the feathers to the place of the ashes, thirty cubits away, and burns the body.<br />

Zevachim 65 – The Logic of Bird Offering
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTZj7lZnHoaBEnY1S7le4CyJagO89YTKxRMykAFZqXpxc0UwIvLCNrPZinxDjzYCLWYsvYsaVw2hx8Ee-SVwyS6Yb-dPO3Rdl4LMdbOXdlYfxndduVRxtpl1MDhnLKmdyS_UBP3YYDtSY/s1600/Pieter+Gysels+-+Still+Life+with+Dead+Birds.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTZj7lZnHoaBEnY1S7le4CyJagO89YTKxRMykAFZqXpxc0UwIvLCNrPZinxDjzYCLWYsvYsaVw2hx8Ee-SVwyS6Yb-dPO3Rdl4LMdbOXdlYfxndduVRxtpl1MDhnLKmdyS_UBP3YYDtSY/s320/Pieter+Gysels+-+Still+Life+with+Dead+Birds.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">How do we know the laws of bird offerings? The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-14.htm">And the Kohen shall bring it to the Altar</a>.” Since it says, “from turtledoves or young pigeons,” you might think that only two birds are valid – the word “it” teaches that even one bird is acceptable.<br />
<br />
The word “Kohen” teaches that only a Kohen can do the killing of the bird (melikah). For you might think that since for animal offerings anybody can do the slaughter, it should also be true for birds – the word “Kohen” dispels this notion. Rabbi Akiva says, “Would it enter your mind that a non-Kohen can approach the Altar? Rather, you might think that the melikah is done with the knife. The word 'Kohen' teaches that it has to be done with the very body of the Kohen, that is, with his nail.”<br />
<br />
Why is the melikah done from the nape? For sin-offering it says, “and he shall perform the melikah on its head opposite the back,” and for burnt-offerings we learn it by the method of the “same word” - “separate,” which is used in both contexts.<br />

Zevachim 66 – Invalidations of Bird Offerings

If one changed the procedure and performed the bird offering on the wrong part of the Altar, the offering became invalid. The same is true if he exchanged the other aspects of the bird service.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, disqualified offerings do not convey ritual impurity. As a rule, an animal or a bird that was not properly slaughtered conveys ritual impurity – the animal by being carried, and the bird by being eaten, at the moment it enters the throat. The offerings above are purified from it.<br />
<br />
In addition, one who uses a disqualified bird offering for his purposes, commits misappropriation of Temple property. Normally, the bird sin-offering, after being killed properly by the method of melikah, is eaten by the kohanim and thus does not have the prohibition of misappropriation. These offerings, however, never became allowed for consumption and remained the property of the Temple, subject to misappropriation.<br />

Zevachim 67 – Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer Argue About a Bird Burnt-Offering

<br />
What is their argument? Rabbi Eliezer's line of reasoning is this. As soon as the owner consecrated the bird as a burnt-offering, it became Temple property, subject to the law of misappropriation. It never lost this status, and thus is forbidden to use.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua, on the other hand, says that if the Kohen changed the burnt-offering with regard to designation, procedure, and location, and did all as if it were a sin-offering, it became transformed into a sin-offering, at least as far as the law of misappropriation is concerned, and there is no punishment for its misuse. Rabbi Yehoshua agrees that the Kohen still should not eat it.<br />

At other times, however, the invalidation is not so strict, and although the bird cannot be eaten, it does not transmit impurity. What are the cases?<br />
<br />
If an unqualified person performed the melikah (killing the bird with the nail from the back of the neck), it cannot be eaten, but it transmits no impurity. The same result happens when a kohen performed the melikah with his left hand, or at night, or if he slaughtered unconsecrated birds inside the Courtyard.<br />
<br />
By contrast, if he performed melikah with a knife rather than his nail, or he performed melikah on an unconsecrated bird inside the Courtyard, or on consecrated birds outside the Courtyard, or if he performed melikah on turtledoves that are too young or on pigeons that are too old, a bird  whose wing has atrophies, or whose eye has been blinded or foot cut off – these transmit impurity when swallowed.<br />

The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-15.htm">And any person who will eat an animal that died by itself or was torn... - he shall immerse his garments and immerse himself in the water and remain impure until evening and then be pure</a>.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Furthermore, the Oral Law tells us that this verse is talking only about birds, and not about any animals. As an exception, we have previously learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">if a bird has a melikah applied to it, even in the wrong way - it may not have the law of a bird who died by itself</a>.<br />
<br />
What if the Kohen did a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">melikah</a> to the bird and then it was found to be a “trefah,” - possessing a defect that would surely cause its death anyway? Rabbi Meir says that it does not contaminate, and Rabbi Yehudah says that it does.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir proves his points of view by comparing with the slaughter of an animal – whose impurity is more strict, and nevertheless the slaughter purifies it – and the same should be true for birds.<br />

Zevachim 7 – Thanksgiving Offering Slaughtered as a Thanksgiving Offering of Another

This does not mean that he wants the sacrifice of one to become the sacrifice of the other! That would a simple case of change in the ownership of the sacrifice, and it would not be credited to its owner. Rather, the Kohen meant that the offering of one owner should assume the sacred properties of another one, but still belong to the first owner.<br />
<br />
Rabbah said that it is valid: all thanksgiving offerings are the same, even those of different people. Rav Chisda said that it is invalid: each person's thanks are different - for example, one may be thankful for successfully crossing the sea, while the other one – for being released from prison. This leads to a change in holiness, making the sacrifice not valid for its owner. The argument remains without a clear winner.<br />

Zevachim 70 – Ritual Impurity of Birds According to Rabbi Yehudah

Why does he say so? After all, Rabbi Meir compared this to the slaughter of animals, where the slaughter does remove the impurity.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah found a verse which he expounded. In regard to the carcass of a kosher species of bird the Torah says “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-15.htm">died by itself or was torn by wild animals</a>”. Why is the word “torn” mentioned at all? If a torn animal can survive for a year, then it does not transmit impurity until it actually dies. And if it cannot survive a year, then it is already like dead, and this is the case of “died by itself,” and it imparts impurity. Either way, we already know the answer.<br />
<br />
Therefore it must be that the extra mention of the word “torn” teaches us that if it was torn, then even if it was slaughtered correctly, this does not remove its ritual impurity, and one who eats it becomes impure.<br />

One of these cases is when the owner of the sacrifice died. Since the sacrifice is only brought to atone for his misdeed, and there is no atonement after death, such sacrifice cannot be brought. Furthermore, it cannot be left to graze until it develops a blemish which would allow to redeem it - which is a usual solution in such circumstances. Instead, it is left confined in a cell without food. The other cases include consecration by exchange, an offspring of a sin-offering, the owner being atoned for  with another animal, and an animal that is older than one year.<br />
<br />
If any of these doomed animals got mixed-up with other sacrifices – even if only one became mixed with ten thousand – they must all be left to die. The root cause of it is that this sacrifice is forbidden for all benefit, and thus measures need to be taken to avoid possible transgression. The law about five cases of a sin-offering is in the category of laws that were taught to Moses on Sinai and cannot be derived from the Torah.<br />

This is the rule of nullification by simple majority. The Sages have introduced stricter rules, such as nullification of one part in sixty, but nevertheless the possibility of nullification in a mixture should exist. Why is it that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-71-animal-mix-up.html">a forbidden sin-offering, when mixed with permitted offerings, is never nullified, even one in ten thousand</a>?<br />
<br />
The answer is that living creatures are considered important in their own right and are never nullified. But let us pull out an individual animal and say that since it came from a group where the majority is permitted, then we can presume that it is permitted! - No, this won't work. Since the animals are not really mixed but are standing, we cannot apply a rule of pulling from a majority. But let us make the animals move, then they will be mixed, and we will be able to apply a rule of pulling from a majority! - Sorry, but this is prohibited by the Sages, because people may mistakenly take an animal before they started moving.<br />

However, this presupposes a certain way of counting, and not everyone agrees to it. The argument arose when counting vegetables, and here it is.<br />
<br />
If one has bundles of fenugreek (valuable spice) that grew in a vineyard and thus became prohibited, they should be burned. If they mixed with permitted ones - Rabbi Meir says they must all be burned. But the Sages say that the prohibited bundle is nullified in 200 of permitted ones. What is the argument? Rabbi Meir considers anything that is normally counted as important, which can never be nullified, but the Sages says that only six things (pomegranates and sealed casks of wine among them) are important. In explaining this, Rabbi Yochanan said that only things which are exclusively counted and not weighed, are important. Since sometimes animals are sold by total weight, they should be nullified!<br />
<br />
Answer: there is yet a third counting opinion, known as “the bag of figs” which says that anything that is only sometimes counted is never nullified. According to it, one forbidden sacrifice is not nullified.<br />

<br />
What is the background of this ruling? The ring that was used for idol worship is forbidden for all use. Thus all 101 rings should be forbidden. However, by the Torah law, the forbidden ring should be nullified in simple majority. It is the Sages who removed this nullification. And it is the same Sages who reinstated the nullification in the case when one ring accidentally fell into the sea and is no longer available.<br />
<br />
The ruling of Rav is completely at odds with <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-73-how-does-one-count.html">our previous ruling that one forbidden sacrifice is not nullified even in ten thousand permitted sacrifices</a>. Since the sacrifices are consigned to die, we should just wait till the first one dies, then say that this one that died was the prohibited one, and bring the rest! The answer: Rav's “ring” opinion follows only Rabbi Eliezer, but the majority of Sages do not agree to it.<br />

Zevachim 75 – Mixing Wine vs. Mixing Animals

<br />
Rav Nachman said about this that only he who quaffs and drinks could issue such a ruling. How is one allowed to open the cask in the first place? Rather, if one of the casks was opened accidentally, one can take out the percentage of intermixed tithe and drink the rest.<br />
<br />
If two sacrifices of the same kind became mixed up, then the Kohen takes one and says, “Let this sacrifice be in the name of whoever it belongs to,” and then slaughters it. But the owner needs to put his hands on his animal's head and confess his guilt!? - That is indeed true. Rather let us say that this rule applies when the animals were already slaughtered, and the cups with their blood got mixed. <br />

Zevachim 76 – A Leniency That Leads to a Stringency

Rabbi Shimon suggests that we can still resolve the situation by bringing both in the north (which will work for both types of sacrifices) and eating them according to the stringencies of the guilt-offering. We will have brought the offerings right away. <br />
<br />
However, the Sages disagree with this solution because of the principle that one may not expose offerings to more invalidations than necessary. By applying the stringencies of a guilt-offering to both, one shortens the time to eat the peace offering, which may lead to its invalidation. Rather, the animals to be offered should be left to graze until they become blemished, then sold, and the money from the proceeds should be used to buy replacement offerings.<br />
<br />
Where pieces of meat of different offerings became intermingled, everybody agrees that they have be eaten with the limitations of the most stringent of them – since in this case there is no way out similar to the above.<br />

<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says, “Let the kohen place all these limbs on the Altar, and I view the sin-offering (which is not supposed to be burned) as if it were mere wood.” But the Sages say that the limbs must be left until the next morning, when they  become invalidated as “leftovers”, and then they can be burned together with all other invalidated offerings, in a place specially designated for this.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? After all, the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-12.htm">They may not go on the Altar for satisfying aroma</a>...”  Rabbi Eliezer says, “for satisfying aroma they should not go, but they can go on the Altar as fuel for fire.”<br />

This is true even if there is more water than blood, and even though some unconsecrated water will be thrown on the Altar – since it is not the intent of the Kohen to throw water.<br />
<br />
If wine fell into blood, we view this wine as if it were water. If that amount of water would change the color of blood, then the blood is invalid, even though wine, being red, does not change the color of the blood.                                                                                                          <br />
<br />
If sacrificial blood became mixed with the blood of an unconsecrated animal, or the blood of a wild beast (no wild beast, even if it is kosher, such as a deer or antelope, may be consecrated for sacrificial use), we again view the additional blood as if it were water, and estimate the color accordingly.<br />

Other possible approaches to mixtures can be by volume or by taste, and they depend on whether the mixed substances are of the same or different nature.<br />
<br />
What happens when blood of unblemished offerings mixed with blood of blemished offerings? Since this is a common occurrence, the Sages decreed that such blood must be poured into the canal, which ran from the Temple into the adjoining fields. The Sages adopted this decree to prevent a situation where someone may mistakenly rule that there is enough valid blood, whereas in reality the valid blood would be nullified by the invalid one.<br />
<br />
What if not the blood, but the cups holding that blood got mixed up? Rabbi Eliezer says that if one cup was already offered, then we can say that it was the blemished one, and offer the remaining ones. The Sages, on the other hand, say that even if all but one were offered, we cannot bring the remaining last one.<br />

<br />
From where do we know this fact? From the phrase "Watch the month of spring and make a Passover offering" we derive that all actions of the Passover sacrifice should be done in the name of that sacrifice, and not any other one. <br />
<br />
However, from this we only know that the change of the designation ruins the sacrifice. How do we know that if the priest erroneously intends that the sacrifice should belong to someone other than its true owner, that this too makes it invalid? Because of the phrase, "Say, this is the Passover sacrifice". This phase is extra and not needed to teach the previous prohibition, so we apply it to the change in ownership.<br />
<br />
However, so far we only know the requirement not to change the designation or the ownership of the sacrifice. How do we know that if we do change it, this makes the sacrifice completely invalid? From the phrase, "Slaughter the sacrifice for the Lord your God", meaning, every action should be done as commanded.<br />

<br />
Said Rabbi Eliezer to Rabbi Yehoshua, “But if a Kohen were to perform only one application with this mixture, he would violate the prohibition not to subtract from the Torah!” Answered Rabbi Yehoshua, “And if he were to apply it with four applications, he would transgress the prohibition not to add to the Torah!”<br />

Said Rabbi Eliezer in his defense “The prohibition not to add applies only when the blood is by itself, and here we have a mixture of bloods,” to which Rabbi Yehoshua countered, “The prohibition not to subtract applies only where the blood requiring four-sided applications is by itself, but here it is mixed with blood requiring one application.” <b>And then Rabbi Yehoshua added a winning argument:</b> “With your four application you actively transgress 'do not add' with your hands, whereas with my one application I only refrain from performing additional applications but I do not transgress with my hands.”<br />

<br />
If, however, the Kohen went ahead and applied the mixture outside, and then inside, it is valid. The only potential problem could have been when outside blood is brought inside, and this did not happen here. If, however, the Kohen applied it first inside and then outside, then Rabbi Akiba declares the outside blood invalid – for the very reason we just mentioned, that of outside blood being first brought inside. The Sages declare the blood valid in all cases except of a sin-offering. <br />
<br />
The underlying reason for their disagreement is this: the Torah prohibited the blood on a sin-offering from entering the Sanctuary. According to Rabbi Akiba, this applies to all sacrifices, but according to the Sages, it does not.<br />

If one received the blood of a sin-offering in two cups and took one of these cups outside, the other cup remains valid. However, if one cup was brought inside the Temple Hall, then Rabbi Yosi still declares the second one valid, but the Sages invalidate it.<br />
<br />
Argued Rabbi Yosi, “The invalidation of taking the blood outside should be more serious, since even thinking of taking the blood outside already invalidates the offering.” How can the Sages attach more importance to bringing the blood inside? - The Sages base their opinion on the verse “...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-30.htm">that from its blood shall be brought inside</a>.” They explain this to mean that if any of it is brought inside, all blood is invalidated.<br />

<br />
However, this statement can be understood in different ways. Rabbi Yehoshua takes it to mean that anything fit for the Altar's fire is sanctified in this way, but not invalid blood and libations. Rabban Gamliel understands this to mean that anything fit to be offered on the Altar becomes its fare, and this includes blood and libations.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon, however, makes a very fine distinction: according to him, the offerings are always sanctified and stay on the Altar, but the invalid libations, once they touch the Altar, stay there, if the owner brings just libations alone, but do go down, if they are brought together with a sacrifice.<br />

Which invalidations does this include?<br />
<br />
A sacrifice that was kept overnight, one that was taken out of the Courtyard after slaughter, one which became impure, one about which the kohen had an intent to consume it beyond its time or outside its place, and one whose blood was received or thrown by a disqualified person.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah disagrees about some disqualifications and says about them that they need to be taken down even if they were already brought up on the Altar. These include one that was slaughtered at night, whose blood was either spilled or taken out of the Courtyard. His logic says that only disqualifications that are allowed under certain conditions can stay on the Altar, but those that are not allowed anywhere else, have to come down.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon, on the other hand, gives a different rule: any sacrifice that was valid prior to entering the Courtyard and whose disqualification happened in the Courtyard, if it went up the Altar, may stay there. <br />

Zevachim 85 – These Must be Removed from the Altar

Meat from the former is eaten by the kohanim, while meat from the latter is eaten by the owners of the sacrifice. Also in this category are flour offerings of barley brought on Passover and the two loaves brought on Shavuot, the show-bread, the remainder of a regular flour offering (since it is eaten), and the incense – since it is only offered on the inner Altar, not the outside one.<br />
<br />
The wool on the heads of lambs and the hair on the beards of goats, as well as bones, sinews, horns, and hooves all have a special law: as long as they are attached to the burnt-offering they came with, they should be brought up on the Altar together with the offering, but if they are separate from it, they should not be brought.<br />
<br />
Is a sodomized bird valid for the Altar? Since the relationship is not reciprocal and the bird cannot sodomize a human, then perhaps even if the bird was sodomized, it can still be brought as a sacrifice, or, after all, since a sin was committed with it, maybe it is invalid? The answer: since the sodomized bird is not mentioned in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/02/zevachim-84-altar-has-already-accepted.html">the list of disqualified offerings that may remain on the Altar because there are situation when they are permitted</a> (bird cannot sodomize a human), then perforce a sodomized bird is never valid as a sacrifice.<br />

All the parts they were included in the rule of “once they are on the Altar, they should not be removed,” if they fall off, need not be returned – but it is merely allowed to do so. Similarly, the embers, if they fell off the Altar, need not be returned, but if they did not completely fall off the Altar, they must be returned to the pyre.<br />
<br />
Limbs of valid sacrifices that burst off the Altar – if this is before midnight, they need to be returned, and are subject to the law of misappropriation of sacred property, but after midnight they need not be returned. <br />
<br />
Just as the Altar sanctifies that which is fit for it, so does the ramp leading to the Altar sanctifies. And just as the ramp sanctifies, so do the sacred vessels.<br />

Is it also true if it already was on top of the Altar?  Do we compare the Altar to the show-bread Table, where the bread can stay for any length of time, or do we compare it to the ground of the Courtyard? Rava sides with the first opinion, but Abbaye did not agree with him.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish asked a question, “Do Temple vessels sanctify what's in them?” Answered Rabbi Yochanan, “We learned <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/02/zevachim-83-offering-invalid-parts-on.html">the rule that the vessels sanctify just as the Altar does</a>!” But Resh Lakish was unconvinced, “That rule only tells me that the invalid substance in the vessel need not come down from the Altar if it was put there, but can I bring it there in the first place?”<br />
<br />
If someone suspended invalid offering parts in the airspace above the Altar, may they remain and be burned on the pyre? - Since the ramp of the Altar sanctifies, and since a kohen would have to lift the sacrificial part in order to move it to the Altar, it must be that the airspace does not invalidate it! But this proof is not accepted, for perhaps the kohen drags it.<br />

Flour Temple vessels were also used for measuring, having the capacity of one issaron (between 11 to 21 cups). The vessels designated for fluids sanctify liquid offering, and those for dry offerings sanctify only dry offerings, but not the liquid ones.<br />
<br />
If an object used in Temple service became defective, it was never repaired, but completely replaced instead, because of the rule that "there is no place for poverty in the place of opulence." Thus, punctured vessels were completely molted down and made into new vessels, but not patched, and the vestments of the kohanim were only washed from slight dirt, where water alone would be sufficient (and then using soap was allowed), but otherwise they were replaced.<br />
<br />
The trousers worn by the kohanim atoned for immorality, the turban - for arrogant people,  the belt - for improper thoughts of the heart, the breastplate of the High Priest - for wrongly administered justice, his ephod (apron) - for idolatry, the bells on his tunic – for hurtful speech, and the golden plate on his forehead – for brazenness.<br />

For example, daily offerings are brought before the additional Shabbat offerings. The rule is applicable to all situations, but it is derived from the order of sacrifices, as the Torah has said, talking about additional Passover offerings, “<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/28-23.htm">Besides the morning burnt offering which is continual burnt offering, shall you offer these</a>,” - &nbsp;which teaches that the regular daily burnt offerings come first.<br />
<br />
If there is a choice of two actions, one more sacred or more special than the other, the special one comes first. For example, the application of the sin-offering blood comes before the burnt-offering, because the sin-offering brings forgiveness. How is this derived?<br />
<br />
The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/8-8.htm">and the second bull you will take as a sin-offering</a>.” The word “second” is extra – we can count and know that it is the second – rather it teaches that it is brought second. On the other hand, it &nbsp;said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/8-12.htm">one bull a sin-offering, another – a burnt-offering</a>,” so which one comes first? - Sin-offering, since it effects forgiveness, has its blood brought first. Burnt-offering, since it is burned completely, has its limbs burned first.<br />

However, the same Passover sacrifice, brought at any other time of the year, is invalid, if brought for its (Passover) sake, but valid, if brought for the sake of any other sacrifice.<br />
<br />
What is the reason for this ruling – really, for the second part of it, since the first part was discussed on the previous page? Said the father of Shmuel, “And if from the flock is his offering for a peace offering to God.” This teaches that something that comes from the flock (Passover) can become a peace offering.<br />
<br />
But maybe this is so only if it is brought as peace offering? How do we know this is true for other types of sacrifices? Said Rabbi Illa in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, in the phrase “for a peace offering” the word “offering” is extra, and this teaches that the law applies to every type of sacrifice.<br />

Just as they precede in offering, so they precede in consumption.<br />
<br />
If we have a peace offering from yesterday and a sin-offering from today, then the peace offering should be eaten first, because it would an expression of disdain to allow yesterday's offerings to spoil – this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages maintain that the regular rule of “more sacred comes first” still applies even here.<br />

For consumption, the Kohanim are allowed to cook the offerings in any way they like, to roast, boil, or fry them, and to add any spices.<br />

Rabbi Shimon continued, “If you see oil being poured upon the fires of the Altar, again you don't have to ask what it is; it is either the remainder of a wafer flour-offering of the Kohanim (for their flour offerings was completely burned), or it is the remainder of the daily flour offering of the Anointed Kohen.

Thus, if its blood spattered on a priestly garment, that garment must be laundered in water right in the Courtyard. If the offering was cooked in a earthenware vessel, the vessel must be shattered, and if it was a metal vessel, it must be purged. Also, any food that touches the meat of a sin-offering and absorbs its flavor assumes the same stringencies as the meat.<br />
<br />
Thus, the rule is that if blood of a sin offering is spattered on a garment, this garment requires laundering in the Courtyard. Even though the Torah, in giving this law, spoke only about sacrifices that are eaten, the law is equally applicable to other sin-offerings, which are not eaten, but are brought in the Holy of Holies instead. Nevertheless, the stringency of laundering in the Courtard only applies to valid blood, but if the sacrifice was invalidated, laundering can be done elsewhere, whether the offering had a period of time when it was valid, or if it was never valid.<br />

Or maybe the blood becomes invalid when landing on the first garment, and then the second garment does not need laundering?”<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince answered, “Great question! But I will answer either way: if the blood is still valid, the garment needs laundering, and if it is invalid, then I follow Rabbi Akiva to say that since it was valid at some time, it still makes the garment liable to laundering.” However, in truth the law is not like Rabbi Akiva, and thus Levi's inquiry remains unresolved.<br />
<br />
If the blood spattered directly from the neck onto the garment, it does not require laundering. Similarly, if it spattered from the horn of the Altar, from its base, or if it spilled on the floor and was gathered up, the garment does not require laundering. It only requires laundering when the blood was received in a sacred vessel first, and then spattered on a garment.<br />

Zevachim 94 – Laundering is a stringency of sin-offering
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdL0lwDPFq-y8qIb7KgWSo5xvIcNS5lo3g1LufhVHWdDs07oWOM9ynARPHqwMhN87H5210RoaPo29MdtAcWDdZDip5BL2rBH5glElB5VZI02vYPK01WUYcUYuksVIUknSOTZbWdHKlKXI/s1600/Edward+Stott+-+The+Washing+Day.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="289" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhdL0lwDPFq-y8qIb7KgWSo5xvIcNS5lo3g1LufhVHWdDs07oWOM9ynARPHqwMhN87H5210RoaPo29MdtAcWDdZDip5BL2rBH5glElB5VZI02vYPK01WUYcUYuksVIUknSOTZbWdHKlKXI/s320/Edward+Stott+-+The+Washing+Day.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though the Torah talks about blood spattering on a garment, we can generalize it, and include everything that can be laundered like a garment, and everything that can become ritually impure like a garment – since even the smallest piece of a garment is usable and therefore can accept ritual impurity.<br />
<br />
If the blood of a sin-offering spattered on a hide, then if the hide was not yet stripped from the animal, it does not require washing (because it cannot be a garment yet), but if it was stripped from the animal, then it does require washing (because the skin can be designated for use as a mat by the owner in his mind) – these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. However, Rabbi Elazar says that until it becomes a garment, and is not merely designated for use, it cannot accept ritual impurity and thus does not require washing.<br />
<br />
Only the place of the blood requires laundering, and it must be done in the Courtyard. So too must the  earthenware be shattered in the Courtyard. Thus laundering is a stringency possessed by the sin-offering over other most holy offerings. <br />

Zevachim 95 – Dirty Garment Left the Courtyard

If it has meanwhile become ritually impure, it must be ripped to loose its impurity, then brought back and laundered.<br />
<br />
Similar law applies to an earthenware utensil, except that if it becomes impure while outside, it cannot be broken – since breaking must be inside. Instead, one punctures a small hole in it, which makes it unusable and leads it to loose its impurity, then brings it into the Courtyard and breaks it there.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish asked a question – What happens if the robe of the High Priest was spattered with blood, taken outside the Courtyard, and there it became impure. The advice above cannot be applied, because <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/28-32.htm">it is forbidden to tear this robe</a>.  It needs to be brought inside and laundered there, but it is forbidden to do so, because it is impure. One is also not allowed to dip it in a mikva to remove its impurity – because that would be the beginning of washing, and washing can only be done inside the Courtyard. <b><i>Readers are invited to submit their solutions</i></b>.<br />

This is true regardless whether the meat was cooked directly in this pot, or if the broth was poured into it from another pot taken off the flame. Even though the Torah gives this requirement when talking about most holy offerings, such as a sin-offering, it is nevertheless true in regards to regular holy offerings, such as a peace-offering. Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that regular holy offerings do not require purging or breaking of the pots.<br />
<br />
Rami bar Chama inquired, “If, when roasting a sin-offering, one suspended it in the airspace of an earthenware oven, does the oven require breaking or not? Was the Torah concerned about cooking and absorption, or even about cooking without absorption?” Can we find the answer in the above rule about broth? - No, we cannot! Broth is a case of absorption without cooking, and our question is about cooking without absorption.<br />
<br />
And what is the reason for breaking? - Because the absorbed flavor becomes prohibited “remains” in the morning.<br />

Zevachim 97 – Can Cooking on the Next Day Remove Forbidden Flavors From the Day Before?
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIs13O-vVFzSrDZGHEh5KnYYQa1bNzmBlDykFA7fPsoA290I0S1hmqPLVo8pmm35gs120fi8nSwGS8RtEz5_enB2RIrJzHWX9iB_TXbG08bsNTC2ISopcwo0AsLkXyMyJEbGJklbduprs/s1600/Ribot+Theodule+-++Augustin+The+Cook+Accountant.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIs13O-vVFzSrDZGHEh5KnYYQa1bNzmBlDykFA7fPsoA290I0S1hmqPLVo8pmm35gs120fi8nSwGS8RtEz5_enB2RIrJzHWX9iB_TXbG08bsNTC2ISopcwo0AsLkXyMyJEbGJklbduprs/s320/Ribot+Theodule+-++Augustin+The+Cook+Accountant.jpg" width="251" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">According to Rabbi Tarfon, if one cooked the meat of offerings in a vessel at the beginning of the festival, he may continue to cook in it the entire festival. The usual requirement of breaking or purging the vessels after the time allotted for the sacrifice does not apply here. However, the Sages say that once the time allotted for eating the sacrifice has passed, the vessel needs to be purged and rinsed.<br />
<br />
They argue about the principle that cooking on the next day remove forbidden flavors from the previous one. Actually, they all agree to this principle, from the Torah perspective. They also agree that the Sages have forbidden this practice. In Rabbi Tarfon's view, the prohibition is relaxed for the festivals, and in the view of the Sages it is not.<br />
<br />
Purging is done with hot water, and additional rinsing – with cold water. When two sacrifices touch and one absorbs the flavor of the other, the mixture is governed by the rules of the strictest one. This applies only to the outer layer where the flavor penetrates.<br />

Zevachim 98 – What Each Kohen is Entitled to

<br />
Basically, every kohen is entitled to a share from every sacrifice. However, practically it would be inconvenient for everyone to come to the Temple when they pleased, so Moses diveded them into eight groups, and later Shmuel and David expanded this to twenty four groups, or families. Therefore, each kohen would have to serve in the Temple for one week in six months, and during this week he was entitled to a share from sacrifices. <br />
<br />
If a kohen became ritually impure and went to the mikveh to dip in order to purify himself, he still needs to wait for sun to go down, after which he becomes completely pure and can eat sacrifices. During that day he is still partially impure, and has no claim to the sacrifices slaughtered on that day, even though he will be fit to eat them in the evening. The same is true for a kohen who needs to offer additional sacrifices for his purification – he cannot take a raincheck to apply it in the evening.<br />

Zevachim 99 – Which Kohen Does Not Get a Share in the Offerings

A kohen who is a mourner is allowed to touch sacrifices – he does not make them ritually impure – but he cannot offer them, and he does not have a claim to a share to eat that night. <br />
<br />
A kohen who has a blemish, whether passing or permanent, does have a share in the offerings and is allowed to eat them, but cannot offer them or do any kind of sacrificial service. <br />
<br />
Any kohen who was disqualified at any point of the service – for example, if he was impure when the blood was thrown but later, when the fats were burned, he became pure – does not have a share in that offering. And one who does not have a share in the meat does not have a share in the hides. This is derived from the Torah phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-33.htm">The one from the among the sons of Aharon who offers (that is, who is fit to offer) the blood of the peace offering and the fat – the right thigh shall be his portion</a>.”<br />
