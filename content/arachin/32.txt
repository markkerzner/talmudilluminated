Hillel enacted a law by which the original owner could deposit redemption money in a special room – and some say, with the court – and then break down the door of the house and enter.

<br />
All constructions similar to a house within a walled city can be likewise sold and redeemed within a year, but not fields – this is the opinion of the Sages. Rabbi Meir, based on the words of the Torah “which is in the city” includes even the fields for a one-year redemption. But it does say “house'! – You are right, and in fact Rabbi Meir includes only pebble fields, which are similar to a house, but not all fields.
<br />
<br />
Jerusalem belonged to all tribes, and therefore the law of walled cities did not apply to it, and houses there could always be redeemed. Other walled cities were re-sanctified by Ezra, and they kept this sanctity, because Jews never stopped living in Israel after Ezra.
