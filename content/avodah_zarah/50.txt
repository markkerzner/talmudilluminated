Often, it was symbolized by a heap of stones – minimally, one stone perched on top of two, crudely representing a head and two arms. Passing idolaters would worship this idol by tossing stones at the heap. These additional stones were forbidden for benefit, either because they were offerings to the Markulis or because they were an enlargement of the original Markulis.<br />
<br />
What is the law regarding the stones found in the vicinity of, but unattached to, a Markulis? Rabbi Yishmael says that three stones found one next to another are forbidden - because they represent a miniature Markulis – but two are permitted. The Sages, however, say that the idol worshippers do not make miniature Markulis; rather, those stones that appear to be with it are forbidden, others are permitted.<br />
