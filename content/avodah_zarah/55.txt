The Sages have additionally decreed that the ordinary wine of idolaters is also forbidden to Jews for all benefits. Furthermore, they decreed that even a Jew's wine becomes prohibited if an idolater touches it.<br />
<br />
Grape juice is in the same category as wine. It does not need to ferment to attain the "wine" classification; instead, it must have been processed to the point where it can be considered a "finished" product.<br />
<br />One may buy the contents of a trodden winepress from an idol worshipper, even though the idol worshipper takes crushed grapes from the juice with his hand and places them on the mound. This is because the liquid is not considered "prohibited wine" until it enters the cistern. One may work together with the idolater treading the grapes, and it is not considered deriving benefit from the forbidden one. However, because it was not allowed to increase ritual impurity in Israel, one was not allowed to harvest the grapes together with an idolater.<br />
