The second statement nullifies the first. If it was uttered after a while, it is definitely a retraction. Even if it was uttered immediately, we assume he changed his mind. These are the words of Ben Nannas.<br />
<br />
However, the Sages say that since he added nothing to clarify his retraction, this may indicate that he understood the contradiction, returned to the first statement, and decided to stop talking to avoid further mistakes. Therefore, the statement giving the seller the smaller amount is operative, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/11/bava-batra-92-implied-warranty.html">keeping the money in dispute in the hands of the current owner</a>.</span><br />
