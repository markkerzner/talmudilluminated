"Within these landmarks and boundaries" means selling as is, regardless of size. The fact that he added the field size compels him to at least come close to this size.<br />
<br />
If the field was found to be of a different size, then if the difference is less than a sixth, the field becomes the buyer's without any adjustment. If the difference is more significant than a sixth, they must adjust, with the seller or the buyer paying the difference.<br />
