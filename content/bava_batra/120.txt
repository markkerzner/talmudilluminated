<br />
This was true, however, only for the first generation after entry because it is introduced with "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-6.htm">this is the thing that God has commanded</a>," which teaches that this "thing" applies only to this generation. The reason was to encourage the Jews who entered the Land to conquer all of it from the Canaanite inhabitants - and not get it through marriage.<br />
<br />
The daughters of Tzelophchad were given the same commandment, but for them, it was just good advice – because they were <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-4.htm">wise</a>, <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-4.htm">expounders of the Torah</a>, and <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-6.htm">righteous</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-11.htm">they followed it</a>. Moreover, a miracle happened to them: they were rejuvenated and married righteous, fitting husbands.</span><br />
