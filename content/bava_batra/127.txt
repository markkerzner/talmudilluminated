The phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">he must recognize the firstborn</a>" is superfluous, and it is interpreted to mean that the father can identify the firstborn to others, that is, help them recognize the firstborn.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />If two sons were born in hiding, and it is not clear who the firstborn is, they can appoint each other as agents against other brothers and together win the portion of the firstborn – so was Rava's advice. They told Rava that even though it sounded logical, the Torah insisted on definite knowledge about a firstborn. Rabbi Yannai explained this to be valid only when the firstborn was known and then mixed up. The next day, Rava publicly announced: "The statement that I made previously was an error on my part."<br />
