<br />
Neither. While learning, the Sage may not have considered all aspects of the matter. On the other hand, a practical ruling may be misunderstood by the observer as to the reason behind it. Rather, the Sage has to declare that the law agrees with a particular view and that it is to be followed in practice.<br />
<br />
Is the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-130-power-to-change.html">ruling about changes in inheritance</a> true for someone on his deathbed, because of "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">on the day when he makes his sons inherit</a>," or even for one who is young and healthy? Rebbi said (and some say ruled in an actual case) that it also works for a healthy person. The two reports disagree on whether "is theory or practice more important."<br />
