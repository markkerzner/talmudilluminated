</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one says to the intended recipient, “Let you and the donkey acquire this gift,” the recipient gets half (Rav Nachman), nothing (Rav Hamnuna), or all (Rav Sheshet).<br />
<br />
Rav Sheshet's proof: if one separates the tithe from a vegetable with a bitter interior, he must add to his tithe from a sweet section. The sweet part is “you,” the bitter part is “the donkey,” and since the tithe took effect, we see that the recipient gets all.<br />
<br />
Talmud argues for Rav Sheshet: <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-50-betrothal-by-liar.html">A man betrothed five women jointly with one basket of figs</a>, and the Sages said that two sisters were not betrothed. This is the case of “you” - the three eligible women and “the donkey” - two sisters who are not eligible – and he got all he could get.<br />
<br />
But the law here follows Rav Nachman.<br />
