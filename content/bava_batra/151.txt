Whenever her health worsened, she would transfer the orchard to him as a sickbed gift, and when she recovered, she would retract the gift.<br />
<br />
Once, she felt weak and sent a message to him, "Come, acquire the orchard from me," but Rav Dimi did not come. She sent a message: "Come, acquire it in any way you wish." Rav Dimi did go and asked her to give him only a portion and perform a formal act of acquisition, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-146-is-talmud-study-hard.html">hoping to make the gift irreversible</a>. She did all that, then recovered and reneged on the gift, but Rav Dimi did not want to return it.<br />
<br />
She went to Rav Nachman, who ruled that since she said, "Woe, I am dying!" she made the gift only under the impression that she was dying and thus may still retract.<br />
