Did Rav really mean that everybody engages in negative speech daily? Rather, he meant a hint of negative speech by using body language and voice inflection.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, "In a place where both open and bound documents are used, if one instructs to write an open one, but the scribe wrote a bound one, it is acceptable because he only said it by way of example."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai also subscribes to the "by way of example" idea, as in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-49-betrothal-with-wrong.html">the case of a woman who appointed an agent to accept her betrothal money of a silver dinar, but the agent accepted a gold dinar</a>. She mentioned the silver dinar only by way of example, and she is betrothed with a golden dinar.<br />
