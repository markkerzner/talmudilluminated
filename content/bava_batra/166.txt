<br />
If the amount becomes erased, such as "... selas," a minimum of 2 is assumed.<br />
<br />
The amount of the loan is mentioned in the upper portion of the document and then again at the end of the document, as in "I have accepted upon myself and upon my heirs a lien for the aforementioned sum of X zuzim," - so that if a letter is missing from the statement in the lower portion, it can be learned from the upper one.<br />
