There was one witness to the snatching, but the defendant said, "Yes, I snatched it, but it was my ingot that I snatched!"<br />
</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />
Rabbi Ami considered the case:<br />
<br />
* Should he be required to pay? But there aren't two witnesses!<br />
* Exempt him based on "Why would he lie?" –&nbsp; he could deny having snatched it altogether? This argument is weakened by the witness.<br />
* Make him swear that he did not snatch it? But he himself admits that he did!<br />
* Make him swear that the ingot was his? We can't concoct oaths!<br />
<br />
Rav Abba offered a solution. The snatcher is obligated to take an oath but can not do so, and all such people must pay.<br />
