<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Once one gets the object, can the other one take it back? Some say “no” - because the court would not allow a perpetual feud. Others say, “Yes, he can take it back.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">One rationale for this principle is that the true owner would eventually come up with the proof of his claim. Furthermore, the true owner would strive more vigorously to retain his property, while the thief would not, knowing that his victory may be short-lived because the owner may subsequently prove his claim.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Peasants Fighting by Adriaen Brower</span></div>
