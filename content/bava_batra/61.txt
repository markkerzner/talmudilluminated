All such regulations depend on the prevailing custom at any given time or place. <br />

If one sells a house without specifying what is included in the sale, he has not sold the annex, even if it opens into the house. Nor has he sold a storeroom in the rear of the house. Such closets served as a storage area for valuables and did not function as part of the living area of the house. Neither has he sold the rooftop if it has a parapet around it at least ten handbreads high.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: A lady in a garden by moonlight - by Atkinson Grimshaw</span></div>
