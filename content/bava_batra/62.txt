</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Suppose one sells a "house" in a large apartment building to his fellow. Even though he defined the boundaries of the entire building in the deed, it is possible that he intended to sell just one apartment, and he drew the boundaries of the whole building only to utilize known landmarks. Since the seller stated that he was selling a "house" (as opposed to an "apartment building"), the boundaries written in a deed are regarded as imprecise, and the buyer acquires only one apartment.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it is recommended that the seller write some clause such as "I am not retaining anything for myself in this transaction," because with it, the seller relinquishes his possible claim that the boundaries he drew were imprecise.<br />
