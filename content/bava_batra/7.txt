If he is unwilling, he may be compelled to help build a gatehouse and a door for the courtyard.<br /><br />A gatekeeper would sit in the shade of the gatehouse and prevent passersby on the public road from gazing into the courtyard. The door was used to keep outsiders from actually entering the courtyard.<br /><br />How long must one be in the city to be treated like one of the city's citizens? - 12 months. But if he bought a house, he is immediately treated like one of the citizens.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: At the Gateway by Guglielmo Ciardi</span></div>
