He has not sold the ship's slaves nor the cargo. If he said, "I am selling the ship and all that is in it,"" - all of these are included.<br />
<br />
Said Rabbah bar bar Channah "Those who go down to sea told me that the wave that sinks a ship appears to have a fringe of white fire at its tip. But when one strikes it with a club upon which the following names of God are engraved, I Shall Be What I Shall Be, Yah, God of Legions, Forever – it subsides."<br />
<br />
He also related, "I saw a frog the size of the city of Akra. A sea monster came and swallowed it, and a female raven swallowed the sea monster. It flew up and sat on the branch of a tree. Come and see how strong that tree was!"<br />
