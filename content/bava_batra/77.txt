If he does not do so, the buyer acquires only the paper on which it is written for use, such as a bottle stopper. The sale would then become void because of the law against overcharge.<br />
<br />
If one says to his fellow, "Sell me this yoke for 200 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuz_%28Jewish_coin%29">zuz</a>," then it is evident that the yoke alone is not sold for this amount, and thus, the oxen are included. But the Sages say," The purchase price is no proof." It may be viewed as a gratuity that the buyer gives to the seller or an overpayment, in which case the sale would be voidable.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Oxen Pulling a Cart by Rosa Bonheur&nbsp;<br />
