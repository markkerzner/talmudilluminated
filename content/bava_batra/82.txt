<br />
If he owns the land, he also recites&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-3.htm">the prescribed verses</a>, thanking God for the Land He gave him. If he does not own the land, he brings the first fruit but cannot recite the verses. Why not? One should be allowed to recite Torah verses!&nbsp; - Either because his words "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-3.htm">the Land that You gave me</a>" will appear false, or because he may regard his fruit as definite first fruit, and because of that neglect his tithe obligations.<br />
