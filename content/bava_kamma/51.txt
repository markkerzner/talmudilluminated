<br />
But the first one was also negligent! In this case, he handed over the pit's cover to the second one.<br />
<br />
But how can a pit of two partners exist? The one who completed it is liable! In this case, one dug a pit nine hand-breadths deep and then they both simultaneously uprooted a clump of earth from its bottom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Ditchdiggers by Vincent Van Gogh</div>
