There are three ways to understand this:<br />
<br />
1. One can pay with bran only if he has no money and no land;<br />
2. One can pay with bran only if he doesn't have money;<br />
3. One can pay with bran even if he has money, and if he has no money or movables left, then he needs to pay with superior land.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Barrels on Money by Victor Dubreuil</div>
