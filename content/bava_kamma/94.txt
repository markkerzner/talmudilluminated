If one does take it from them, a spirit of wisdom and piety does not reside in him. <br />

This enactment was promulgated by the court of Rabbi Yehudah The Prince to make it easier to repent for those who want to do it. It applies only to long-term transgressors who can't return all money. Still, they need to try to return the funds to fulfill their Biblical obligation. It is a disagreement whether  this enactment applies nowadays.</div>
