An outsider who wants to buy a field can easily find another one, but a neighbor gains significantly from being able to buy an adjoining field. This rule is based on "</span><a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/6-18.htm"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">You shall do what is right and good in the eyes of God</span></a>,"<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;which commands one to go beyond the letter of the law.</span><br />
