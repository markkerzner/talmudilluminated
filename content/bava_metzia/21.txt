Therefore, the following objects belong to the finder: scattered produce, scattered coins, small sheaves in the public domain, round cakes of pressed figs, and baker's loaves.<br />
<br />
When someone loses such an object, but before he discovers his loss - Rava says that the thing is already abandoned, but Abaye disagrees. The law in this case follows Abaye: until the owner has consciously despaired of recovering the lost object, the finder is not permitted to keep it.<br />
<br />
This is the "Y" in the six cases abbreviated <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a> <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a> <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-15-abaye-wins.html">L</a> <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-51-should-betrothal-allow.html">K</a> G <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">M</a>, where the law follows Abaye against Rava.<br />
