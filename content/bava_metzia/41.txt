<br />
If the custodian moved the keg for its benefit, such as removing it from an unsafe place – he is not liable to pay compensation because he remains a custodian.<br />
<br />
If, however, the custodian moved the keg for his own benefit, then at this time, he is stealing it, and if it breaks while in his hands, he is liable. If he put it down, then he returned the stolen item and again became a custodian, so he is not liable.<br />
