How do we know that an unpaid custodian doesn't swear about <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-56-things-not-subject-to.html">these things</a>? "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">If a man gives his fellow</a>..." is a generalization, "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">money or utensils</a>..." is a specification, "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">to watch</a>..." is another generalization – and the overall law can include only things that are similar to the specification, like movables with intrinsic value, but not land or documents.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Farmers Planting Potatoes by Vincent Van Gogh</div>
