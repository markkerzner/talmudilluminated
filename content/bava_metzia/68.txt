This free service constitutes interest, so the managing partner must also receive wages.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Double portrait of two men by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Jacopo Tintoretto</span></div>
