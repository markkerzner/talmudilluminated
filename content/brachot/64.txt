The time to become rich or attain a position of power will come as predestined. It may be taken from you altogether if you try to force it. This happened to Absalom, the son of Kind David. <a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/2_samuel/15.htm" target="_blank">Absalon tried to seize kingship from his father by force and failed</a>.<p></p><p>There were two candidates to lead the Academy in Babylonia. Rav Yosef was called "Sinai" because his knowledge was broad and precise, as if it were acquired on Sinai. Rabbah was called an "uprooter of mountains" because of his supreme logic. From Israel came the advice to choose Rav Yosef because everyone needs knowledge, like wheat. But Rav Yosef declined because astrologers predicted that he would live for only two years after he became the head. During the twenty-two years that Rabbah was the head, Rav Yosef carefully avoided all signs of honor that would be due him. Ultimately, he became the head and lead for two and a half years.</p><p>Torah scholars increase peace in the world. <a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/2_samuel/15.htm" target="_blank">God will give might to His nation; God will bless His nation with peace.</a></p><p>Art: Reconciliation of David and Absalom by Rembrandt van Rijn</p>
