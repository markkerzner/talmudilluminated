Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said, “That's no proof! It occurred in the summertime, but once the cold season came upon him, he died” – because in Rabbi Shimon's view a terefah cannot survive for more than a year. The final law is that once an animal survived for twelve months, it is not a terefah. Also, if it is a female and gave birth, it is not a terefah.<br />
<br />
No worm can survive for more than twelve months. Therefore, dates stored in a container for that long are permitted to be eaten, since earth-produced worms disappeared, and new worms are not forbidden until they emerge from the fruit. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, gnats don't live for more than a day. Then what about a popular saying, “For seven years the female gnat kept aloof from the male gnat, because she said to him, 'You saw a fat inhabitant of Mechozah who went swimming in the water and you sucked blood without telling me!'” – They are talking in gnat-years.<br />
