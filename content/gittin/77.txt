If he threw the Get while she was inside his house, even if the Get is with her in the same bed, - she is not divorced because the Get has not been placed in her domain.<br />
<br />
If he threw the Get into her lap or into her sewing basket hanging from her, she would be divorced.<br />
<br />
Later authorities prohibited divorcing a wife without her consent.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Interior with Painter, Woman Reading, and Maid Sweeping - Pieter Janssens</div>
