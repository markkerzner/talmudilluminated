<br />
If he placed it in her hand while she was sleeping, and she awakes, and it is her  Get, - it is not a valid Get.<br />
<br />
If she stood in the street and he threw the Get to her, she would be divorced if it landed close to her. Otherwise, she is not divorced.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Sleeping Girl by Domenico Fetti</div>
