<br />
But what if the husband makes a condition that she can not marry a particular minor? At present, the minor can not marry, but eventually, he will become an adult. By comparison with a minor girl who can divorce, because eventually she will marry as an adult, the Get above is declared not complete separation, thus void.<br />
