This is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/keritot-22-offering-of-uncertainty-for.html">the ruling we saw before</a>. However, if now he ate the second piece, then all agree that he needs to bring a guilt-offering for misappropriation of Temple property.
<br />
<br />
If one person ate the first piece of meat, and then came another person and ate the second piece, the second person did not have a choice. Nevertheless, each one of them needs to bring an offering of uncertainty – this is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Earlier we saw an <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/04/keritot-17-offering-of-uncertainty.html">argument whether a choice between two objects is required for uncertainty</a>, or if a doubt about one object is sufficient, and Rabbi Akiva holds that one object is sufficient.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that since between the two of them they have certainly committed a transgression, there is no uncertainty here. Rather, they bring a guilt-offering in partnership, and stipulate, “If I am the one who committed misappropriation, this is my offering, but if you did – then I relinquish my ownership, and the offering is yours.” Rabbi Yose says that one cannot divide guilt in this manner, and &nbsp;thus the argument reverts back to Rabbi Akiva and the Sages.<br />
