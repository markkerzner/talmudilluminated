Why?<div><br /></div><div>Maybe the husband caused the prohibition, and he also removed it? No, because she is still forbidden to marry his son from the previous marriage or his father.</div><div><br /></div><div>Or maybe a widow is forbidden to marry the High Priest, so she must be allowed to marry everyone else? No, perhaps she would still be transgressing a positive commandment.</div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe when Jewish soldiers went to war, "And whichever man betrothed a wife and did not yet take her, let him return, lest he dies in battle and another man takes her" - is valid proof!</div><div><br /><div>Art: Armand Carrel On His Deathbed by Ary Scheffer</div>
