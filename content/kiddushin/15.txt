<br />
<br />
1. A man who steals and can not repay, who is sold by the courts to pay the one he robbed;<br />
2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father;<br />
3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty;<br />
4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile.<br /><br /><div>
A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave woman to have children.<br /><br />Even today, there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaanite slave woman.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Seated Man with a Youth &amp; a Servant in an Interior by Michael Sweerts</div></div>
