<br />
What is the worth of severance gifts that a master must give to his departing servant? Three kinds of goods: sheep and goats, grain, and wine, for the total worth of thirty selah (equal to the penalty for goring a Canaanite slave), approximately $6,000.<br />
<br />
A Hebrew servant serves his term under the master's son but not his daughter or any other inheritor. A Hebrew maidservant is free if her master dies and does not serve anybody.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Harvesters by Jules Breton&nbsp;</div>
