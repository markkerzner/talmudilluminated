<br />
If one who takes a mother bird together with her young, Rabbi Yehudah says that he incurs lashes and does not need to send the bird away, but the Sages say that he must send the bird away, and does not incur lashes.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon derives through logic the prohibition of eating first fruit mentioned above, by comparing it to <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">the first tithe</a>, and on this Rava comments, “One whose mother is giving birth to him should pray that she should give birth to one like Rabbi Shimon,” and proceeds to refute his logic. If so, why the praise? Because Rabbi Shimon knows how to change the order of words to arrive at what the Torah really meant.<br />
