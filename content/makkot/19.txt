<br />
However, this notion is refuted by comparison with the firstborn animal. The second tithe and the firstborn animals had to be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there. And, just as the firstborn animal can only be offered at the time when the Temple stands – because it needs to be sacrificed at the Altar – so too the second tithe can be eaten in Jerusalem when the Temple stands. <br />
<br />
This argument, however, has an internal weakness: firstborn requires that its blood be placed on the Altar, which is a stringency that the second tithe does not have. Then, how do we know not to bring the second tithe today? Only from the verse, “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">In the place where He will choose to rest His name – there you will eat second tithe and the firstborn animals</a>.” Since they are placed next to each other in the same verse, they have the same law.<br />
