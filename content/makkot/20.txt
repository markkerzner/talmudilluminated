<br />
One who makes a single cut  over five dead people, or one who makes five cuts over one dead person, is liable for lashes for each dead person and for each cut.<br />
<br />For rounding the corners of the head, one gets two sets of lashes, one for one side and one for the other.<br />
<br />
For destroying the five corners of the beard, a person is liable to five sets of lashes. Rabbi Eliezer says that if he cut them as one, he deserves only one set. One is not liable unless he shaves his beard with a razor, but Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable even for shaving with planes.<br />
