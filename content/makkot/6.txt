However, there is an overriding rule that one cannot derive capital punishments by logic – only those that are explicitly mentioned in the Torah are to be followed.<br />

What does the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">by the word of two witnesses or three witnesses shall the one who is to die be put to death</a>" teach? That the law of three witnesses is the same as that of two witnesses: to be established as false plotting witnesses, all three have to be established thus.<br />
