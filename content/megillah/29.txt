However, this is only when there are not enough people to honor the dead. And how many is enough? - Twelve thousand, just as the number of men who went to war with Midian. Others, however, say that it is six hundred thousand: just as the Torah was given to the soul in the presence of six hundred thousand people, it is taken away with six hundred thousand.

Abaye said, "Initially, I learned Torah at home and prayed in the synagogue. Once I understood how God loves the synagogue, I learn and pray there." In another place, we have a conflicting statement, which recommends praying in the place of learning. The synagogue is called "a small Temple." In the future, all synagogues and study halls will be transplanted to Israel.

Close to Purim, in Adar, there are four unique Torah portions read in the synagogue. Here they are. Half-shekel collection for the Temple - because of its timing next month. The portion of destroying Amalek - because of its connection to Purim. The red heifer - since it was used to purify the people before the Holidays. "This month will be for you to celebrate Passover" - because by then, it is already Passover time.
