For example, when one loans money to a friend for the needs of the Holiday, he should not require that the loan document is written. However, if he does not trust the borrower or the scribe is poor and needs the money, writing is allowed. Likewise, a scribe should not write tefillin or  a Sefer Torah. Rabbi Yehudah allowed him to write tefillin for himself – and then change his mind and sell it. And Rabbi Yose says that the enjoyment of the Holiday is more important than refraining from work – therefore, he can write tefillin and sell it, as usual, to add to his festivities.

<br />
One whose relative dies has to observe seven days of mourning after the burial – these are called "shivah"&nbsp;or "seven."&nbsp;However, if a Holiday comes during these days, his “shivah” is canceled by the joy of the holidays. 
<br />
<br />There are thirty days after "shivah" called "shloshim."&nbsp;Likewise, if a Holiday occurs during this time – that is, after shivah and until thirty days after the burial have passed – his shloshim are canceled. 
<br />
<br />
On Shabbat one does not observe any external signs of mourning – that is, he wears shoes and nice clothing, eats meat and drinks wine – and the day is counted as part of his shivah. However, unlike a Holiday, Shabbat does not cancel the mourning, only suspends it.
