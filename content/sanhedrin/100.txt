Upon return, he told Rabbi Yochanan, "Keep expounding, for I saw such stones!" Rabbi Yochanan replied, "And if you have not seen it, you would not have believed it?!" he set his eyes on the student and turned into a heap of bones. <br />

One who reads "external books" may lose his share in the World to Come. Some say these are all books not related to the Torah, while others say they are only heretical. Writings such as Homer's are permitted.<br />
<br />
There is a similar disagreement about the Book of Ben Sira. Ben Sira was a son of the prophet Jeremiah. Rav Yosef quoted him, "A beautiful wife – fortunate is her husband, the number of his days is doubled" (or at least it seems to him so).<br />
