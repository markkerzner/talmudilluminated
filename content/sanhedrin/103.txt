To accept Menasheh's repentance, God made a secret tunnel in the firmament to hide this from the Attribute of Justice.<br />
<br />
Of the things that the evil Jewish kings used to do, Menasheh scratched out the names of God from Torah scrolls and replaced them with different pagan deities; he also tore down the altar in the Temple; Amon burned the Torah and prohibited the bringing of sacrifices. Menasheh had relations with his sister, but Amon had relations with his mother; as it states, "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/33-23.htm">Amon did ever more evil</a>." His mother asked him, "Can you have any pleasure from the source from which you issued?" He answered, "Am I doing this for any purpose other than to vex my Creator?"<br />
