<br />
The people of the Generation of Dispersion – the Tower of Babel – have no share in the World to Come, since God “<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/11-8.htm">dispersed them</a>” in this world and “scattered” for the World to Come. <br />
<br />
The people of Sodom have no share in the World to Come, since they were “wicked” (this world) and “sinful” (World to Come).<br />
<br />
The people of the Generation of the Wilderness have no share in the World to Come, since they shall be “consumed” and “there they shall die” - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and applies to them “<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/50-5.htm">Gather to Me My devout ones, those who sealed a  covenant with Me by sacrifice</a>.”<br />
