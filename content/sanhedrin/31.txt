Even after the verdict has been issued, a litigant can nullify the verdict when he brings evidence to support his claim.<br />
<br />
If the judges found it necessary to impose a time limit and told the litigant, after issuing a verdict against him, "All evidence that you may have to support your claim, you must produce within the next thirty days," then the rule is: if the litigant finds evidence within thirty days, he can nullify the verdict, but if he finds it after thirty days, he cannot nullify the verdict.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "What should this person do? Rather, he may present the evidence even after thirty days." The law follows Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.<br />
<br />
If a litigant saw that he was about to be found liable and then produced witnesses, he is not believed because it is a desperate attempt to win the case.<br />
