Yossi says, "It is forbidden for a judge to arbitrate a compromise." It is certainly permissible for disputants to settle out of court or to ask an arbitrator to help them. However, once they come to court, the judge who arbitrates a compromise shows that, in his opinion, the compromise settlement is more correct than an appropriate ruling based on Torah law. Furthermore, in settlement, the would-be winner is robbed of some money.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha </span><span style="font-size: medium;">says</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> on the contrary that before the verdict, it is a meritorious deed for a judge to arbitrate a compromise - "...<a href="http://bible.cc/zechariah/8-16.htm">execute truth and judgment of peace</a>...", and "judgment of peace" means compromise - like King David, who "...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/8-15.htm">rendered judgment and righteousness</a>..." Rabbi Eliezer explains that King David would render a strict judgment first, but then, if the losing party was poor, he would pay his own money.<br />
