This refers to the lower beard (pubic hair), and not the upper (facial) beard, but the Sages prefer to use clean language. Additionally, he cannot be older than thirteen and three months, so in most cases this age starts at thirteen and ends at thirteen and three months.<br />
<br />
A man can be declared a wayward and rebellious son, but not a daughter, because men are more given to base desires. <br />
