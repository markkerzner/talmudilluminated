<br />
<br />
Since there are thirty-nine types of work prohibited types of work, he can potentially be liable to thirty-nine sacrifices. However, how is this extreme case possible? If he knows that it is Shabbat, but forgets about each specific prohibited work, then what exactly does he know? He may know that the name of the day is Saturday, but since to him it is no different from any other day, he in fact does not know that it is Shabbat! If so, we are back to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/12/shabbat-68-major-rule-about-shabbat.html">the rule</a> where he does not know about Shabbat altogether, and has to bring only one sacrifice!?
<br />
<br />
Answers Rabbi Yochanan: “He knew that each labor was prohibited, but he forgot that for performing them he becomes liable to be cut off from the spiritual source.” That too is considered “forgetting the prohibition” in some sense, and thus become obligated to bring all thirty-nine sacrifices.
