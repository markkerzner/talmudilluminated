In this case, we assume that his intention was the “fund for the upkeep of the Temple,” and they are used as-is, if it is possible (like a hammer or a ladder) or redeemed, and the money then goes to the Temple.
<br />
<br />
What if some of the items among his possessions were animals fit the for Altar? Since they achieved “Temple fund holiness,” they cannot simply be exchanged for a different, even higher, Altar level of holiness. Rather, the male animals are sold, and the proceeds are used to buy burned offerings, this being the highest level of sacrifice. The female animals, which are fit for peace offerings, should also be sold, and the money used to buy peace offerings. Again, this roundabout process is explained by the fact that one level of holiness cannot be simply exchanged for another. All this is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees and suggests we look at the intention of the donor. Since the donor surely wanted the highest level of service available, then the male animals should be offered as burned offerings - because this most likely was the donor’s intention. The female animals are more of a problem. Following the same logic, the donor probably wanted them too to become burned offerings. However, it is not possible with female animals, which can only be peace offerings. Therefore, since the donor's original intent is contradictory, we need to sell them and buy peace offerings with the proceeds. So here we agree with Rabbi Eliezer, albeit not with his reasoning. The Talmud continues with other opinions on what to do with the gifts.
