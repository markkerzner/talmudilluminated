The goat sent away atones for all sins, whether done by mistake or intentionally, provided that the person repents. The day of Yom Kippur itself is greater than this, since it atones for all transgressions between man and God, again, provided that the man repents.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince has an exceptional opinion that Yom Kippur atones even for the person who does <b>not</b> repent (with three exceptions: denying the existence of the Creator, speaking insolently of the Torah, and refusing to be circumcised).&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But according to Rabbi Yehudah, how is it possible to deserve being cut off, which&nbsp;<a href="" target="_blank">the Torah promises for eating and working on Yom Kippur,</a>&nbsp;if the last moment of it affects atonement?</span>&nbsp;- It would apply to one who eats, chokes, and immediately dies in the middle of Yom Kippur, or alternatively to one who keeps eating at the end of Yom Kippur.<br />
