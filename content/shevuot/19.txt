<br />
If one swore, “An oath that I will not eat,” and then, forgetting his oath, ate even a minute amount, he is liable – these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. The Sages said to Rabbi Akiva, “Where do we find regarding one who eats a minute amount of forbidden food that he is liable?” There has to be a minimum amount! Rabbi Akiva replied to them, “And where do we find that one speaks and brings an offering because of mere words?”<br />
