This meat was already prohibited to him before Yom Kippur. Now that Yom Kippur has come, it has brought with it an all-inclusive prohibition to eat this and other foods. The Sages make him liable for two prohibitions: eating unkosher meat and eating on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon, however, does not agree to the principle of inclusive prohibition and makes him liable only for eating unkosher meat.<br />
<br />However, what about the following ruling: for one act of eating, one can be liable to five offerings: an impure person who ate forbidden fat usually brought on the altar, beyond the time allowed for the sacrifice, from a consecrated animal, and on Yom Kippur. According to the principle of inclusive prohibition, why not add another one – an oath against eating fat? - We list only those prohibitions that existed by themselves, not the ones he creates.<br />
