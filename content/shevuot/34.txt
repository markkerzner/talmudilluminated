Shevuot 34 – Why Can Oath of Testimony Be Only About Money?

<br />
Rabbi Eliezer:<br />
<br />
In <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">the verse about the oath of testimony</a>, the word “or” is stated two times, and in <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-2.htm">the verse about the oath of deposit</a> the word "or" is also stated two times. This establishes the connection between the two, and just as oath of deposits speaks only of a monetary claims, so too the oath of testimony speaks only of a monetary claim.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva:<br />
<br />
In the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-5.htm">When one shall become guilty in regard to one of these matters</a>,” the word “of” is a limitation, meaning that there are cases when one is liable and cases when one is not, and when is he liable? - in money matters!<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose HaGlili:<br />
<br />
“...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">and he is a witness who either saw or knew</a>.” Which testimony can be established by either seeing or knowing alone? - in money matters!<br />
