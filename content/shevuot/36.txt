If he swore falsely and subsequently confesses his sin, he must repay the principal plus an additional fifth and bring a “guilt offering” sacrifice in the Temple.<br />
<br />
Although this oath applies to all types of debts – not just deposits – it is nevertheless called the “oath of the deposit”, because a deposit is the first example mentioned in the Torah.<br />
<br />
The oath of deposit applies to both men and women, to non-relatives and relatives, to those who are qualified to serve as witnesses, as well as to those who are disqualified, in court and out of court.<br />
<br />
In truth, there is no reason to think that these rules would not apply – but they are only stated to contrast this with the oath of witnesses discussed previously.<br />
