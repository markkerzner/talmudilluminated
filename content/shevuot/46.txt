<br />
But why should this be so? Didn't we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/08/shevuot-oaths-44-sages-decreed-oaths.html">require the worker to swear about his wages in a similar case</a>? The answer is that in this other case, the employer may have forgotten which worker he had already paid. However, in the case of a wage dispute, the employer certainly remembers the stipulation.<br />
