Sotah 5 – Haughty or humble?

Moreover, when someone is arrogant, God says, "This world is too small for the two of us," or more precisely, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a1.htm">One who is haughty and proud – him I cannot bear (says God)</a>."<br />
<br />
And yet, a Sage must have a small measure of haughtiness. How much? One-eighth of one-eighth. And for a Sage, it is an ornament, like the upper part of a wheat stalk. Rava said, "One who has it is damned, and one who does not is damned." But it is better to err on the side of humility.

<br />
When one prays, though, she should definitely be humble. Following this, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2651.htm">Humble spirit is like God's sacrifices</a>," – which means that prayer with a humble heart is equal not to a specific one but to all sacrifices together.<br />
