Both days are commemorated by fasting. These days are three weeks apart; Lamentations hints at this by saying, "<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm" target="_blank">All her pursuers overtook her within the straits.</a>" What are the five bad things?<p></p><p>Moses broke the Tablets of the Covenant. The Talmud makes the calculation: Moses went up the Mount Sinai and got the Tablets, spent forty days learning the Torah, and came down when he heard the Jews worshiping the Golden Calf. This day was the seventeenth of Tamuz.&nbsp;</p><p>Other events were: the invading Roman army breached the walls of Jerusalem; a Greek general, Apostumos, burned the Torah scroll written by Ezrah the Prophet and put idols in the Temple.</p><p>Art: The Siege and Destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans by David Roberts</p>
