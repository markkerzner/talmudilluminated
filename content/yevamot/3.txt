However, this is not mentioned in the Torah directly. Instead, this prohibition is derived by connecting with another ban in two steps.<p></p><p>We are not talking about his legitimate daughter because she is "his wife's daughter," and it is indeed prohibited. Instead, we are talking about his out-of-the-wedlock daughter from his lover who is not his wife.

Second, <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=18#P3259" target="_blank">one should not sleep with his son or daughter's daughter</a>&nbsp;because it is a shame. Since these two phrases include a similar word, "shame" or "heinnah" in Hebrew, we can combine the prohibitions and derive that sleeping with one's daughter, even born out of wedlock, is incest.</p><p>The teacher (Tanna) who taught this law loved involved logic.
