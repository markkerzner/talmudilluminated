However, since the widow may be pregnant, the Sages established that neither yibum nor chalitzah can be done for ninety days after the brother dies.
<br />
<br />
If the brother violated this decree and performed chalitzah earlier, and then it was found out that the widow was pregnant – which means that the brother did not die childless -- then the chalitzah was meaningless. As a result, he is still allowed to marry the widow's relatives – because he was never connected to her. Likewise, she is permitted to marry his relatives: a valid chalitzah is considered a divorce, thus forbidding her to marry his relatives, but this chalitzah is considered nothing. She is not a divorcee and can even marry a Kohen.
<br />
<br />
However, if the brother hurried to do a yibum but found that his brother's wife was already pregnant with a child, then he was not allowed to do a yibum, because it does not apply in the presence of a child. Since he transgressed a prohibition of marrying his brother's wife in the situation when this is forbidden, they have to separate, and bring a sacrifice. However, if they later find out that the child was not viable, the marriage can continue.
