In fact, the Torah says that “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-30.htm">Any sin-offering whose blood was brought into the Tent of Meeting... may not be eaten</a>.” Rabbi Eliezer says that this is also true of the guilt-offering, since the Torah said, “just as the guilt-offering so is the sin-offering,” but the Sages insist that this is only true for the sin-offering.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of the Sages - for seemingly, the Torah supports Rabbi Eliezer? The Sages defend with this logic: if burnt offering, which is completely burnt, is not disqualified by bringing its blood inside the Temple, then the guilt-offering, which is not completely burnt, surely cannot be thus  disqualified! Now the arguments are as follows:<br />
<br />
* burnt offering is no proof, because it does not achieve atonement!<br />
* but the flour of a the one who swore falsely achieves atonement and still it is not disqualified if part of it is brought inside!<br />
* but the flour does not require slaughter!<br />
* but burnt offering does require slaughter and is not disqualified!<br />
<br />
We came a full circle. What is common between all these? That they are holy and are not disqualified by bringing their blood inside, so the guilt-offering is not disqualified – say the Sages.<br />
