Even if the Kohen did not have any of these intentions in mind, it is still valid, and therefore the Court decreed that the Kohanim should say nothing at all, because they have the power to ruin things.<br />
<br />
Now we begin to study the proper places for sacrificial services. All most holy offerings are slaughtered to the north of the Altar. The first ones on this list are the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur service – their slaughter is to the north of the Altar, and their blood should be received in the service vessel to the north of the Altar.  <br />
