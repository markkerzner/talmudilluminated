The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-15.htm">And any person who will eat an animal that died by itself or was torn... - he shall immerse his garments and immerse himself in the water and remain impure until evening and then be pure</a>.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Furthermore, the Oral Law tells us that this verse is talking only about birds, and not about any animals. As an exception, we have previously learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">if a bird has a melikah applied to it, even in the wrong way - it may not have the law of a bird who died by itself</a>.<br />
<br />
What if the Kohen did a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">melikah</a> to the bird and then it was found to be a “trefah,” - possessing a defect that would surely cause its death anyway? Rabbi Meir says that it does not contaminate, and Rabbi Yehudah says that it does.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir proves his points of view by comparing with the slaughter of an animal – whose impurity is more strict, and nevertheless the slaughter purifies it – and the same should be true for birds.<br />
