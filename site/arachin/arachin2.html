Furthermore, one can promise either a monetary value - the price that this person could fetch in a slave market - or a symbolic value, expressed in shekel coins, in the <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27">amount prescribed by the Torah</a>.
<br />
<br />
All persons can both declare such a vow and be the subject of it, a man or a woman, Kohen, Levi, or a regular Jew.  An androgyne or a person of undetermined gender can do all of the above, except for a symbolic value. Since Torah-assigned values are provided only for definite males or females, these two do not have specific symbolic values that can be donated for them. Thus, if one makes a "personal valuation" vow related to them, it is always treated as a monetary value they would fetch in a slave market.
<br />
<br />
A deaf, deranged, or a minor can have their value donated by others, but they themselves cannot make such vows. Since they lack sufficient understanding, they are considered legally incompetent.
