Rather, the profits from the bath go to support the priest of the idol. Can one benefit from the bath, which is the property of the idol? Since idols cannot own property, the rule is that "there is no consecration of property to an idol," and the bath is allowed to be used. However, one is not permitted to pay the priest, as his payment would support their work. Some opine that one is allowed to pay but not to express gratitude to the priests, so that one does not come to be influenced by them.<br />
<br />
An idol of a non-Jewish idol worshipper becomes prohibited immediately after he forms it, but that of a Jewish idol worshipper, only after it is worshipped. However, Rabbi Ishmael gets an opposite result from the phrase, "You shall destroy the places where the nations worshipped their gods," - which, according to him, means that they become gods only after being worshipped.<br />
