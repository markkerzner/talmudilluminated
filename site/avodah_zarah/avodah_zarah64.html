Do we say that since the worker temporarily desires the continued existence of the wine - so that he can be paid for destroying it - his wage is prohibited for benefit? Or perhaps, any action to destroy futility (idolatry) is permissible, and certainly the wage is permissible?<br />
<br />
Said Rav Nachman, "Let him break the barrels and may a blessing come upon him!"<br />
<br />
Can we support Rav Nachman from the ruling about mixed seeds: one is not allowed to weed the forbidden seed mixture, because he helps it grow. Rabbi Akiba makes one liable even for passively keeping the mixture. However, one is a allowed to accept a contract to uproot them. Now, this is parallel to the wine case, since for a time the worker wants the seeds to exist - until he uproots them - and it is allowed! This indeed supports Rav Nachman.<br />
