According to him, doing business with the worshippers of the Sun, who dedicated every Sunday to the God of the Sun, is always prohibited.<br />
<br />
However, today these prohibitions no longer apply, because today's idol worshippers perform the rituals only by rote. Moreover,  many societies have adopted a moral code that differs significantly from the lifestyle that idol worship expressly permitted. To emphasize this point, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein referred to American society as a "Government of Benevolence."<br />
<br />
When should one ask for his personal needs, before or after the prayer? Some say, following the example of Moses, that one should begin with praise to God and then ask for one's needs. Others say that for us to follow Moses would be presumptuous. Rather, we should ask for our needs first, which will lead us to realize that we can rely only on God. We will then be in the proper state of mind to pray, whereas Moses did not require this preparation.<br />
