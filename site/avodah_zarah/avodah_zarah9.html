Actually, there were two victories, one in the time of Cleopatra, and before that, against the Greeks.<br />
<br />
The Romans fought thirty-two battles against the Greeks but were unable to overcome them, until they accepted Israel as a partner. They then sent a message to the Greeks: "Until now we were fighting with weapons, but now let's reason. If one has a carbuncle and a Torah scroll, which one should be made into a setting for the other?" The Greeks replied, "The carbuncle should be the setting for the Torah scroll." The Romans then replied, "If so, we have a Torah scroll with us, for Israel is with us." Then they went ahead and defeated the Greeks.<br />
<br />
The Romans promised to treat Israel as partners, but after twenty-six years, they subjugated Israel. What was their logic? At first they relied on "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/33-12.htm">I will proceed alongside you</a>," implying partnership between Esau (Rome) and Jacob. But later they expounded "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/33-14.htm">Let my master go ahead of his servant</a>," which indicates that Esau (Rome) is the leader.<br />
