There were two victories, one in the time of Cleopatra and before that, against the Greeks.<br />
<br />
The Romans fought thirty-two battles against the Greeks but were unable to overcome them until they accepted Israel as a partner. They then sent a message to the Greeks: "Until now we were fighting with weapons, but now let's reason. If one has a carbuncle and a Torah scroll, which one should be made into a setting for the other?" The Greeks replied, "The carbuncle should be the setting for the Torah scroll." The Romans then replied, "If so, we have a Torah scroll with us, for Israel is with us." Then, they went ahead and defeated the Greeks.<br />
<br />The Romans promised to treat Israel as a partner, but after twenty-six years, they subjugated Israel. What was their logic?&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">At first, they relied on "<a href="" target="_blank">I will proceed alongside you</a>," implying a partnership between Esau (Rome) and Jacob.</span>&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">But later, they expounded, "<a href="" target="_blank">Let my master go ahead of his servant</a>," which indicates that Esau (Rome) is the leader.</span><br />
