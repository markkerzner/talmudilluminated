You will be punished for transgressing God's will. It is analogous to a case of a king who was angry at his servant, confined him in prison, and ordered that no one feed him. One who provides the slave should be put to death. And you <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-55.htm" target="_blank">Jews are called servants of God</a>.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> No, <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" target="_blank">Jews are called children of God</a>, and this is similar to a king who was angry at his son, but one man still fed him, which made the king happy.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">T. </span>You are called children when you do God's will, but now you are in exile.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span> Then we should surely feed the poor because "<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/58-7.htm" target="_blank">You will break your bread for the hungry when captors (Romans) come to your house</a>..."</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Alms to the Poor by Martin Drolling</span></div>
