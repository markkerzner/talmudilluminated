In that case, he may not take the new path back, but the original one does not become his.<br />
<br />
The standard width of a private path is 4 amot (6 ft), the public thoroughfare is 16, and the standing ceremony is 4 kavs (60x60 ft). As people were walking from the cemetery, the leader would say, "Stand, dear ones, stand." Then he would say, "Sit, dear ones, sit," and they would sit and bemoan their loss. This was done seven times, corresponding to <a href="http://bible.cc/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">seven "futilities" in Ecclesiastes</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/8-22.htm"> seven components in the cycle of times</a>.</span><br />
