The primary succession of heirs is thus as follows: a man's primary heir is his son. The estate reverts to the deceased man's daughter if there is no son. After this, the next eligible heir is the deceased's father, and if there is no living father, the estate reverts to that father's own heirs.<br />
<br />
There are persons who can inherit and bequeath possessions, such as a son, who can inherit from his father but also bequeath to him. Some inherit but do not bequeathâ€”such as a son and his mother: he can inherit from her, but the mother does not inherit from her son. <br />
