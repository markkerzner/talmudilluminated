<br />
In connection with this, there was a <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-9.htm">commandment for a Jewish woman to marry only within her tribe</a>. The commandment was in force only during the years of conquest of the Land of Israel. It applied only to a woman who could potentially inherit land at the time of marriage - that is, if she had no brothers and was thus her father's prospective heir.<br />
