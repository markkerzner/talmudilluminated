<br />
Abaye asked him, - Could it be that the one who dies by day has his sons inherit his property, but the one who dies by night does not? Of course not! Rather, since it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-11.htm">this should be to the children of Israel as a statute of judgment</a>," inheritance has the laws of a court case. For example, suppose three people visit a sick person who instructs them concerning his last will. In that case, they have two options: write it down as witnesses or act as court judges and execute the judgment - but only by day since all court cases must be started by day.<br />
<br />
Said Rabba Bar Chanina, "Yes, that is what I meant."<br />
