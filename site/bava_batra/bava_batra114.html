<br />
Whenever this happens, parties are entitled to retract for a certain period. For how long? Rabbah said, "As long as they are seated at the same location." Rav Yosef said, "As long as they discuss the same subject."<br />
<br />
However, both Rabbah and Rav Yosef need help with the rule learned previously about a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-113-inheritance-to-be.html" target="_blank">court executing the last will</a>. If a sick person can retract, none of their decisions are valid! Rav Yosef answers that this rule only applies while they are still discussing inheritance.<br />
