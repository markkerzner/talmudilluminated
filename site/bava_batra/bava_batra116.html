Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, "Whoever does not leave behind a son to inherit him, the Holy One, Blessed be He is full of anger toward him." <br />
<br />
From where do we know this? "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">If a man dies and he has no son, and you will pass (veha'avartem) his inheritance</a>" and "evrah" means a day of anger, as in "<a href="http://bible.cc/zephaniah/1-15.htm">a day of anger</a>."<br />
<br />
But is it a son or a student? Since Rabbi Yochanan lost his ten sons and would console people with "Look, this is a bone of my last son," - it must be that he meant a student, for otherwise, he would not publicize that God was angry with him. Then why did he say "son?" - These were the words of his teacher, but he himself felt that a man must leave a student.<br />
