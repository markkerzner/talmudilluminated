<br />
One can understand Yom Kippur since it is the day of forgiveness, but what is the significance of the 15th of Av? On that day:<br />
<br />
* The tribes were allowed to intermarry with each other;<br />
* The tribe of Benjamin was allowed to marry members of the other tribes;<br />
* Those destined to die in the Wilderness ceased to die;<br />
* Jews were allowed to go on the pilgrimage festivals;<br />
* The slain of Bethar were afforded burial;<br />
* They stopped chopping trees for the Altar.<br />
