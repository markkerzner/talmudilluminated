<br />
<i>Rabbis</i>: the firstborn does not take the double portion of that;<br />
<i>Rebbi</i>: the firstborn takes a double portion of those benefits that happen automatically, but not those that the orphans brought to the estate through their actions.<br />
<br />
What are their arguments?<br />
<br />
<i>Rabbis</i>: the expression "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">to give him the double portion</a>..." compares the double portion to a gift. Just as a gift cannot be given unless it has come into the donor's possession, so does the double portion, which includes only present assets.<br />
<br />
<i>Rebbi</i>: The words "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">double portion</a>..." make the law for both portions the same, including future automatic benefits.<br />
