<br />
However, suppose one distributes his property before his death, increasing the share of one and decreasing the share of the other or making the portion of the firstborn equal to those of the other brothers. In that case, his words stand because he conveyed the portions of his estate as gifts rather than bequests.<br />
<br />
If at any point in a document, whether at the beginning, the middle, or the end, one wrote that the awards are conveyed as "gifts," even though the document also contains language of inheritance, his words stand. <br />
