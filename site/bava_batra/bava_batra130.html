<br />
However, if he increased the portion of one son among the other sons, or one daughter among the other daughters, or completely eliminated the portion of one son, leaving everything for the other sons, his words stand. Thus, one can change the portion of those in the same inheritance order. This ruling contradicts <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-126-changing-portions-in.html">the one cited earlier</a>; indeed, it is the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and is the one accepted in practice.<br />
