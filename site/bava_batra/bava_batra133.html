By disinheriting his children, he usurps the order of succession ordained by the Torah.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: "If his children were not conducting themselves properly, he is remembered for good." Does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explain the ruling or argue against it? <br />
<br />
The sons of one man did not conduct themselves properly, and he left all his possessions to Yonathan ben Uziel, who, in turn, sold a third, donated another third to the Temple, and returned the rest to the sons of the donor. Shammai came after him with his stick, but Yonathan proved to Shammai that he had done right.<br />
