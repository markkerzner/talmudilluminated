However, one way to accomplish property transfer is to give over the title to the possessions now but the right to use them only after death.<br />
<br />
When one writes his properties over to his sons for use after death, he must indicate this by including the clause "from today and after death," - says Rabbi Yehudah. But Rabbi Yossi says that it is enough to write "after death," and the date on the document indicates that he means "from today."<br />
<br />
In such a case, the father cannot sell the properties completely because they are written over to his son, and the son cannot sell them because they are in the father's possession.<br />
