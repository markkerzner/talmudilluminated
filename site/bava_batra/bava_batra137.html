Resh Lakish says that the buyer does acquire them. Rabbi Yochanan considers the ownership of the rights to the produce tantamount to ownership of the property itself. Therefore, the father, who uses the property and is the primary owner, prevents the sale. Resh Lakish disagrees with this premise.<br />
<br />
If one says, "My property shall go to you, and after you to so-and-so," then the first can sell it, and the second has no recourse. However, initially, the first one should not sell it. One who gives him advice to sell, since after the fact the second one has no recourse, is called a "smart bad person."</span><br />
