When the estate's property is meager, the daughters are supported, and the sons go begging at the door.<br />
<br />
According to Biblical law, a person survived by his sons and daughters is inherited only by his sons. The Sages, however, instituted that a man stipulate to his wife in her marriage contract (ketubah) that their daughters who survive him be entitled to support from his estate until they marry or reach full maturity.<br />
<br />
Admon says, "Because I am male, do I lose?" Rabban Gamliel prefers his opinion, but the final law follows the first authorityâ€”the daughters take priority.<br />
