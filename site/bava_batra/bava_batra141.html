If she gives birth to a tumtum (a person of indeterminate gender), he does not get anything, but if he is the only child - he inherits all.<br />
<br />
So the man prefers a daughter? But we learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-116-man-who-leaves-not-son.html">one should leave a son</a>! Either he realizes that a daughter needs more, or he follows Rabbi Yehudah's opinion that a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/09/bava-batra-17-god-blessed-abraham-with.html">daughter is a blessing</a>.<br />
<br />
But how can an unborn child acquire a gift? This follows Rabbi Yossi's opinion that a fetus inherits<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-130-power-to-change.html">&nbsp;Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah's opinion that a will made to the one who inherits is valid</a>.</span><br />
