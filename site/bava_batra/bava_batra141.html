<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S0lnzFG8IGI/AAAAAAAADHk/_G6DMZjFP0M/s1600-h/Henri-Fran%C3%A7ois+Riesener+-+Mother+and+Her+Daughter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S0lnzFG8IGI/AAAAAAAADHk/_G6DMZjFP0M/s320/Henri-Fran%C3%A7ois+Riesener+-+Mother+and+Her+Daughter.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one whose wife is pregnant says, “If my wife gives birth to a boy, he takes a hundred zuz ($5,000) and if to a girl, she takes two hundred zuz – the infants acquire the money. If she gives birth to a tumtum (a person of indeterminate gender), he does not get anything, but if he is the only child – he inherits all.<br />
<br />
So the man prefers a daughter? But we learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-116-man-who-leaves-not-son.html">one should leave a son</a>! Either he realizes that a daughter needs more, or he follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah that a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/09/bava-batra-17-god-blessed-abraham-with.html">daughter is a blessing</a>.<br />
<br />
But how can an unborn child acquire a gift? This follows the opinion of Rabbi Yossi that a fetus inherits, and <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-130-power-to-change.html">the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah that a will made to the one who inherits is valid</a>.</span><br />
