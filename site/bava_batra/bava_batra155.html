The Sages, therefore, instituted that one can not sell land inherited from a father until one is twenty. In addition, to make a sale, one needs to be physically mature. This usually happens at 12 for girls and 13 for boys, but may come later.<br />
<br />
One person in Bnei Brak sold land he inherited from his father and later died. The members of the father's family challenged the sale, saying that the seller had been a minor at the time of his death. Everyone admitted he was twenty, but the family claimed he did not have two pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva told them, "Firstly, you are not permitted to defile him through an examination. Secondly, it won't help since signs of maturity change after death."<br />
