<br />
In contrast, a "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-160-document-that-is-folded.html">bound" document</a> requires that the witnesses sign between each fold. However, this opens a possibility of forgery.<br />
<br />
Should we be concerned that, having the witnesses already signed above, he will write an additional clause at the end of the document that benefits him? - No, because the words "firm and established" are written at the end of a bound document. <br />
<br />
What if he erases the words "firm and established," adds to the document, and then writes the words "firm and established" again? -&nbsp; Additions do not invalidate the document, but erasures, even certified with "firm and established", do invalidate it.<br />
