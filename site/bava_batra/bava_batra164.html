<br />
Rebbi offered a rebuttal: the dating system on the two types of documents is different. Jews dated their documents by the year of the rule of the current monarch. Governments used to add a year to the number of years of the current king to proclaim that  a relatively new monarch was already established. The Sages, desiring to make a bound document very complex, also added a year for bound documents but not for regular ones. One could unbind the document, effectively changing the loan date, receive the payment, pretend to have lost the loan document, offer a receipt, and then collect the second time.<br />
<br />However, according to Rabbi Chanina, a receipt is never used.<br />
