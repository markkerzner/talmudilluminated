<span style="font-size: medium;">If a young dove was found within fifty amot (100 feet) of a dovecote, it belongs to the owner of the dovecote; if farther than fifty amot - it belongs to the one who found it. Rabbi Yirmiyah asked, "What if one of its legs is within fifty amot, but the other leg is outside of fifty?" - and for asking this question, the Sages ejected Rabbi Yirmiyah from the house of study.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">One must distance a permanent granary fifty amot from a city, and a temporary granary must be far enough from his neighbor's saplings or his plowed field so that the chaff that flies from the granary will not cause any damage.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Peasant Girl and Doves by Henry Mosler</span></div>
