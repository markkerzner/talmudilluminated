Rabbah bar bar Chanah signed two documents: a notification that the sale was executed under duress, as well as the document of purchase.<br />
<br />
Said Rav Huna: both documents have legal force. But how can it be? Instead, Rav Huna meant that the forced sale would be valid if not canceled by the prior notification - since it was Rav Huna who introduced <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-48-is-forced-action-valid.html">the forced sale rule</a>.<br />
<br />
But we have a rule that a witness, having testified, can't offer a new testimony contradicting his first one. How could Rabbah sign on both documents? - Exactly! Since he signed on the notification of duress first, his signature on the sale document becomes invalid.</span><div><br /></div><div>Art: Queen Elizabeth Sign The Condemnation To Death To Maria Stuart by Sandon Liezen Mayer</div>
