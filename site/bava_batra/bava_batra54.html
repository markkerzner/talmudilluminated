<br />
<i><b>The rule</b></i><br />
<br />
A convert is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/04/bava-kamma-110.html">like a new-born child</a>: he has severed connection with his old family, and if he has not created a new one yet, he has no inheritors. One who spreads out mats on the ownerless land of a deceased convert and lies down upon them has acquired the land.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Proof</b></i><br />
<br />
One can acquire a Canaanite slave using a propriety act, such as having the slave put on a shoe for him, remove his shoe, or lift him. We see that supporting the weight is a propriety act - and so it is with the land: spreading the mats and lying down on it constitutes a proprietary act. <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/10/kiddushin-23-can-canaanite-slave-woman.html" target="_blank">Compare this to a slave woman</a>.<br />
