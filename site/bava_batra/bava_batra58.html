<br />
When he reached the crypt of Abraham, he found Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, one of the seven righteous people who never died. Rav Banaah asked, What is Abraham doing?" and Eliezer replied, "He is lying in the arms of Sarah, and she is peering at his head." This symbolizes the true union of Abraham and Sarah, which transcended the physical limitations of their earthly marriage. <br />
<br />
Eliezer announced Rav Banaah, and Abraham said, "Let him enter. It is well known that there is no physical desire in this world." Rav Banaah surveyed the dimensions and departed.<br />
