<br />
However, to get to the cistern, the seller has to purchase the right-of-way from the buyer, in the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. According to him, the typical inclination of one who sells something is to transfer it fully and generously without reserving anything for himself. In this case, he also transferred the right of way by not saying anything. The Sages disagree and say that typically, the seller wants to sell no more than he has to, retaining the right to pass through the house to reach the cistern.<br />
