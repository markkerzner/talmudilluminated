Hence, the sale of this building includes all non-movable items used in the pressing process. <br />
<br />
One who sells the house of an olive press without specifying what is included in the sale has sold the vat, the crusher (used to pre-soften olives), and the "maidens." These items are automatically sold with the press because they are attached to the building where the press is housed.<br />
<br />
However, he has not sold the boards, the wheel, or the beam. These items are excluded from sale because they are not attached to the building.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">If he said, "I am selling you the house of the olive press and all that is contained therein," he has sold all of these items - but not unrelated items that are merely stored in the house.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: The Production of Oil by Philip Galle, engraving<br /></span><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
