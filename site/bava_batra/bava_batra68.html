Still, he has not sold the movable property in town, such as household implements and food, because he plans to take these with him.<br />
<br />
However, if he said, "I am selling you the town and all that is contained therein," then even if there were animals and slaves in the town at the time of the sale, they are sold along with the town.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "He has sold even the <i>santer</i>." What a santer is&nbsp;is a matter of dispute: either a town clerk, a slave owned by the city who kept information on boundaries and ownership of properties, or the fields that immediately surround the city.<br />
