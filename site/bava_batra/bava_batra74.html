<br />
An Arab merchant told me, "Come, I will show you Mount Sinai." I went and saw that scorpions surrounded it, and they resembled white donkeys. I heard a Heavenly voice saying, "Woe to me (God) that I have sworn to exile My people, and now that I have sworn, who can annul the oath for Me?"<br />
<br />
When Rabbah returned, the Rabbis told him,&nbsp; - Every Abba (his proper name) is a donkey, and every bar bar Chanah is a fool. You ought to have declared, "It is annulled for You."<br />
<br />
And Rabbah, what did he think? That perhaps the Heavenly voice was talking about <a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/8-21.htm">the oath about the Flood</a>. <br />
<br />
And the Rabbis? If so, then why did the Heavenly voice say "Woe is to Me" about something that is for mankind's good?</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Donkey Frieze by Franz Marc<br />
