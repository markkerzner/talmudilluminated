<br />Doves tend to lay a pair of eggs almost every month of the year. These eggs hatch and produce one male and one female, which themselves begin to mate at the age of two months.<br />
<br />
In order to stay in the dovecote, the mother must have her daughter as a companion in addition to her mate. The daughter, too, must have her offspring as companions since her mother is not company enough. The buyer must, therefore, leave all these pairs and not take them for himself.<br />
