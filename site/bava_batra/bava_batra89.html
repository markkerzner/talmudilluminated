Regarding "..<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/18-27.htm">all these</a>..." illicit relationships, a shorter form of "these" - "el" is used, but regarding false measures, "...<a href="http://scripturetext.com/deuteronomy/25-16.htm">all who do these</a>..." a more extended form, "eleh" is used. Why? One cannot remember all those he has cheated and return money to them.<br />
<br />
"<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-14.htm">You shall not have false measures in your house</a>..." - why in your house? It is forbidden everywhere! This teaches that "you shall not have in your house" because of false measures.<br />
<br />
In some places, sellers customarily add a little extra to the scale on which the produce is weighted, while in others, they add a little after weighing. Deviating from the prevailing custom is not recommended because it may lead an onlooker to make a mistake in the future.<br />
