One may only leave the Land of Israel and go live outside the Land if food prices have doubled. Rabbi Shimon says that this is permitted only when one can't find wheat at all, but if wheat is available, even at very high prices, one should stay, provided that he can afford to feed his family.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai also used to say that Elimelech (the husband of Naomi in the book of Ruth) and his two sons were the most extraordinary men of their generation and the caretakers of their generation, and for what reason did they die? For moving out of the Land of Israel during famine, even though wheat was available to them.<br />
