All these are general guidelines without a prevailing local custom; however, if there is an accepted custom, it is binding.<br />
<br />
If the buyer suspects that the grain contains more impurities than 1/24 and begins to sift it, and it is found that it contains more than the allowed 1/24, he may sift all the grain and return ALL the impurities to the seller. Really, one expects to receive good quality grain, only that he would not bother to sift. Once he starts sifting, however, he can continue to sift all.<br />
