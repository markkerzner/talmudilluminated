However, others say that if this water has the flavor of wine, the blessing is "Who created the fruit of the vine."<br />

If he poured three cups of water and when the liquid was decanted, four cups were produced, all agree that it is wine due to one cup of wine added from lees. If three cups were produced, all agree that it is water. They argue only when three and a half cups were decanted. The Sages say that three cups went in and three cups came out, so only one-sixth is wine from lees, while the other says that of the three cups that went in, one-half cup remained, and two half-cups of wine came out, making the mixture strong enough.<br /><br />
