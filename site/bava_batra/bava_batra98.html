Rabbi Ishmael, however, says, "This is nothing but a cattle barn!"<br />
<br />
Incidentally, this ruling teaches that it is not proper for a son-in-law to live in his father-in-law's house. Instead, the groom's father usually built a small annex adjoining his house, where the newlywed couple could live. This accords with the teaching from the book of Ben Sira: "Lighter than bran is the son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law's house. Still lighter is a guest who invites another guest. And lighter yet is one who gives an answer before he has heard the question."<br /><br />
