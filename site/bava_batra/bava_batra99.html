He may not bring his animal and give it to drink directly from the pit, but he must fill a container and give the animal to drink outside.<br />
<br />
The pit owner makes a lock for the cistern, and the homeowner makes his lock. The cistern owner makes the lock so that the homeowner will not rob him of his water. The homeowner makes the lock to avoid suspicions of impropriety concerning his wife.</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
