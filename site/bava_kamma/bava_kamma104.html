He may not give it to the victim's son nor to his agent, but he may give it to an agent of the court.<br />
<br />
The court then holds the stolen property until the victim calls for it. The Rabbis enacted that this should suffice to ensure that a potential penitent would not be discouraged.<br />
<br />
The agent above is informal, but a formal agent appointed with two witnesses can receive the payment.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Miners Wives Carrying Sacks by Van Gogh</div><div><br /></div>
