He has to find the victim, restore what he stole, add one-fifth, and bring a guilt offering to the Temple.<p></p><p>What if he returned the principal but not the fifth and now swears that he returned the fifth? If he then confesses that he again took a false oath, he must restore the amount, add one-fifth, and bring another guilt sacrifice. This process can continue until the principal amount is reduced to less than a prutah (about five cents.)</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Train Robbery by Frederick Morris</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
