The son then admits his guilt - he pays the principal and the one-fifth surcharge (for false oath) to his father's other sons or to the father's brothers - who are the next in line to inherit.<br />
<br />
Although the robber is his father's heir, he may not keep what he stole - for he must fulfill the dictate to return stolen property.<br />
<br />
If he doesn't wish or can't pay, he may borrow from others, repay, and his creditors may then come and collect the debt from his inheritance.<br />
