<br />
Suppose the father leaves his children interest money, and they know it is interest. In that case, they are not obligated to return it - because they have acquired it through the combination of the owner losing hope to recover it and the change of ownership domain.<br />
<br />
The court can't accept witnesses' testimony in the absence of the defendant - unless he refuses to come and there are pressing circumstances.<br />
