One was with a barrel of wine, the other with a jug of honey, and the barrel of honey cracked. If the wine owner poured out his wine and saved the honey, he received only the laborer's fee. If he said, "I will save your honey, but you must pay me for my wine," - the other is obligated to pay.</div>
