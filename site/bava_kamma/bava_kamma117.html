If one steals a field from his fellow, and the extortionists then take it from him, then if it is a province-wide plague, meaning that the extortionists have appropriated the fields of others as well, the robber can say to the owner, "Behold, what is yours is in front of you." But if the field was taken on the account of the robber, then the robber is obligated to provide the owner with another field.</div>

<div>
But we already understand that "if not, the thief pays!" Rather, it is yet another case where he did not take the field away but showed it to the extortionists.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Christina's World by Andrew Wyeth</div>
