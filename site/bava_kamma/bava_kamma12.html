Since the slaves are inherited like land, based on "...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-46.htm">you shall bequeath them as permanent property</a>..." can one acquire movables together with the slaves? - No, because they move, unlike cities in Judah.<div><br />

One is not liable for damages to properties belonging to the Temple, based on "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-35.htm">the ox of his fellow</a>..." - his fellow, but not Temple.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Casket of jewels on a table by Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten</div>
