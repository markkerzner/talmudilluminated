Thus, if a dog killed and ate sheep or a cat killed and ate a chicken, it is a case of unusual damage and not collected in court. However, this only applies to large animals, but small animals are in the "tooth" damage category and can be collected.<br />
<br />
Five damage categories are considered unusual and liable for only half-damage: domestic animals who gore, push, bite, squat, and kick. Among the five damage categories deemed normal, with their owners "warned" of the complete liability: an animal while walking ("foot"), an ox that already gored, and a man that does damage.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Woman Eating And Feeding Her Cat by Gabriel Metsu</span></div>
