Fruits and vegetables. The owner pays only half the damage if an animal eats a garment or utensil. When is this? On the damaged party's premises, but if the animal eats in the public domain, the owner pays only for what he benefited by skipping its next feeding.<br />
<br />
Eating in a pinch, such as cats eating dates and donkeys eating fish, is normal damage.<br />
<br />
If one lives in the yard of his fellow without the latter's knowledge, does he have to pay rent? The inquiry is only in regard to a yard that is not for rent and a person who usually rents.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Ete, Chat sur une Balustrade by Theophile Alexandre Steinlen</div>
