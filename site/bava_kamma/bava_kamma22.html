If it fell? This opinion implies that the owner is not liable. Still, the final law is that the owner is responsible in a situation that begins with negligence and ends in an unavoidable mishap.<br />

If a dog took the biscuit from the coals and went to a stack of grain sheaves, where it ate the biscuit and set fire to the stack, for the biscuit, the dog's owner pays full damages, and for the stack, he pays half the damage.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Peasant Burning Weeds by Vincent Van Gogh</div>
