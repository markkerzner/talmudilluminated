Is that fire his "property," and he is liable only for the damages, or is it "arrows" - his own force, and he is liable also for pain, healing, and unemployment? The answer is that it is like "arrows."<br />
<br />
A cow is only liable for eating someone else's fruit if it veered into someone's field. The cow's owner could try to claim that the cow's mouth is his premises, and "What is your fruit doing in my cow's mouth?" but the above case of a dog that ate a biscuit precludes this.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Improvised Field Hospital by Jean Frederic Bazille</div>
