In that case, Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira says that the one wielding the sword is liable to execution because he hastened the child's death. Still, the Rabbis absolve him because the child is considered partly dead. They argue if "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-17.htm">all human life</a>"&nbsp;means any or all of it.<br />
<br />
If one places a jug in the public domain and another comes and stumbles and breaks it, the pedestrian is not liable. If the pedestrian was damaged by it, the owner of the jug is liable.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Still life with an overturned jug by Jan Jansz. den Uyl</div>
