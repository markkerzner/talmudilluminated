Rabbi Meir makes him liable even when he stumbled or if the pitcher broke by itself; if a camel stumbled, he is liable if he stumbled first and the camel tripped over him.<br />
<br />
They also argue after the breakage: one maintains that if a person leaves his hazardous objects and declares them ownerless, he is liable, while the other one maintains that the person is not liable.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Cellar Boy by Jean Baptiste Simeon Chardin</div>
