In that case, the owner of the straw is liable for damages, and whoever is the first to take the straw acquires it - but we do not publicly announce this last law.<br />
<br />
Even in those cases where it is allowed to put hazardous objects out, such as pouring water out in the street in a rainy season, if a passerby is damaged, the one who poured out the water is liable.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Boat in the Flood by Alfred Sisley</div>
