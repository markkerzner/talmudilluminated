Although the potter lying on the ground caused the damage passively, this is a case of damage inflicted by "man" since the obstacle was his body. He is consequently liable even for the damage to the second person's utensils. Although stumbling is not negligence, he should have warned the person behind him.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Pottery Painting by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema</div>
