<br />
Said Rabbi Yochanan, - This ruling only talks about the time right before Shabbat, when running for the sake of Shabbat is allowed, but otherwise the one who runs is liable.<br />
<br />
Suppose one chops wood in the public domain and thereby does damage in the private domain, or chops in the private domain and damages something in the public domain, or chops in private and damages something in the private domain. In all the cases, he is liable for full damages.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Two Young Women Walking by George Frederick Watts</div>
