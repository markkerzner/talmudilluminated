<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If the owners of both were warned that the oxen have gored three times, one pays for the excess full damages.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If one ox was innocent and another one warned, then if the damage done by the warned one is more significant, the owner pays for the excess full damages. If the damage done by the innocent one is more significant, the owner pays for the extra half of the damage.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Similarly, if two people injure one another, they pay for the excess full damages.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Portraits of two extraordinary oxen, the property of the Earl of Powis by James Ward</div>
