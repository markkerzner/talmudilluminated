<br />
If the ox of a Jew gored the ox of a Canaanite, the Jew was exempt. Still, if the ox of a Canaanite gored the ox of a Jew, the Canaanite paid full damages - a penalty on Canaanites who had no court system and were generally not careful about other people's possessions (Meiri), thus not applicable today.<div><br /></div><div>Art: A Husbandman with his Herd by Paulus Potter</div>
