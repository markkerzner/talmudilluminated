<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
But why?&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Borrower: "I borrowed an ox, not a lion!"&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Owner: "I told you it was aggressive, so you had to guard it. And even if it were innocent, you would pay half the damages."</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Borrower: "For the innocent, the payment comes from its body."</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Owner: "Even so, you would then repay me for the ox."</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Lion by William Huggins</div>
