<br />
Since "... the ox shall surely be stoned..." means that it died without proper slaughtering and is forbidden for consumption, "...its flesh may not be eaten..." teaches that even if the owner slaughtered it, its meat is still prohibited.<br />
<br />
And "...the owner of the ox shall be innocent (clean)..." teaches that he can't sell it, as people say, "so-and-so has gone out clean of his possessions."<div><br /></div><div>Art: Cook with Food by Frans Snyders</div>
