To make the owner of a goring ox liable to redemption payment for the killing of a woman as for a man? No, it is already written: "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-28.htm">if an ox shall gore a man or a woman</a>..." &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Instead, to equate a woman with a man in damages: if a man dies before collecting, his damage payments go to his heirs, so too does a woman - her damage payments go to her heirs and not to her husband - because the husband inherits only the actual assets that the wife possessed at the time of her death.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Edmond And Therese Morbilli by Edgar Degas</div>
