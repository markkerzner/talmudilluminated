<div>An unpaid custodian is responsible only for damage resulting from his negligence.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>A paid custodian is responsible if the item is stolen or lost but not for unavoidable mishaps, such as an animal that broke a limb, was captured by armed brigands, or died of natural causes.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>A borrower is liable for theft, loss, and unavoidable mishap but not for damage or loss incurred through regular use.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: A Yeoman of the Guard by Sir John Everett Millais</div>
