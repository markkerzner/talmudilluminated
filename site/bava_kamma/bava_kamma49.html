<br />
But if a <span style="font-style: italic;">person</span> intended to strike his fellow and instead struck a pregnant woman and her offspring were miscarried, <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-22.htm">he must pay her husband the full value of the offspring</a>. For this,&nbsp;they assess how much she was worth before giving birth and how much after miscarriage, using prices of the slave market. Of course, if the woman suffered an additional injury, that damage is assessed separately.<br />
