<br />
If combined, can the two teach liability for fire? Ox has the intent to damage, whereas fire does not. However, a man is liable even for damage that he inflicts while sleeping. Thus, the intent to damage is not essential.<br />
<br />
Man is liable for four damage payments but fire for just one. However, the ox disproves that since it is also liable for just one payment.<br />
<br />
Man and ox are alive, and fire is not; thus, liability for fire had to be mentioned in the Torah.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Girl Sleeping By The Fire by Friedrich Wasmann</div>
