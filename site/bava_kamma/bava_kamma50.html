<br />
Whatever shape one digs, he is liable to pay for the damage his excavation causes. If so, why is specifically a pit mentioned in the Torah? Just as a standard pit has sufficient depth to cause death, being ten hand-breadths deep, one is liable for any obstacle that has sufficient depth to cause death.<br />
<br />
One is not liable for the death of a donkey in a pit less than 10 hand-breadths but is liable for the injury.<br />
