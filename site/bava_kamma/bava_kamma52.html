<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If one covered a pit properly and nevertheless an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, he is exempt.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If an ox with its utensils fell into a pit and the utensils broke, the pit owner is liable to pay for the damage to the animal but is exempt from paying for damage to the utensils. </div>
