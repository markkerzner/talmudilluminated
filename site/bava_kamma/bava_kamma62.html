The house owner must take an oath about the value and be reasonably expected to have such items.<br />
<br />
One is liable for direct or immediate damages, not indirect or delayed ones.<br />
<br />
Suppose a camel laden with flax passed through the street, and its flax protruded into a shop and was ignited by the shopkeeper's lamp and set fire to a large tower; the owner of the camel is liable. If the shopkeeper puts his lamp outside, the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Yehuda says that the shopkeeper is not liable for a Hanukkah light.<br />
