<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
"Being found" and "will it be found" include everything and limitations: ox, donkey, and sheep exclude one thing each: ox excludes land, donkey excludes slaves, and sheep exclude legal documents from twofold payment.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
"If being found, will it be found" excludes from the twofold payment one who incriminates himself. Even if witnesses do come after his confession, he pays only what he stole.</div>
