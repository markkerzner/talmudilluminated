<br />But whose best land is it?<br />
<br />
Rabbi Ishmael says: "The damaged party's choicest field or the damaged party's choicest vineyard." Why? Just as another man's field (mentioned before) was that of the damaged party, the payment is also measured by the quality of the damaged party's land.<br />
<br />
And Rabbi Akiba says: "he shall pay his choicest field," which clearly means - with the choicest field of the one who is paying."<br />
<br />
Money or valuables are also acceptable.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Grape Grower by Jacob Gerritsz</div>
