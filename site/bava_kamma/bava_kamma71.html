She can't sue him for the sheep in court. Since the rule is that "one is subject only to the greater (death) penalty," their deal is invalid, but the prohibition still takes effect.</div>

If one stole an ox of two partners and then admitted his liability to one of them, - he doesn't pay a fivefold payment to him, but does he pay half of it to the other partner? Rav Nachman said, "No! Five oxen and not five half-oxen!" but the following day, he admitted he erred due to fasting.</div>
