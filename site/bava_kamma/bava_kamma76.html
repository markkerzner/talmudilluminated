Granted, when he slaughters it, it's the Temple's property, not the original owner.<br /><br />But when he consecrates it, let this be equivalent to selling a stolen animal to the Temple - thus making him liable for a fourfold or fivefold payment? No! Consecration differs from a sale: after consecration, the animal is still called "A sacrifice of so-and-so," not a "sacrifice of the Temple."<br /><div><br /></div><div>Art: David Garrick and his Wife by his Temple to Shakespeare at Hampton by Johann Zoffany</div>
