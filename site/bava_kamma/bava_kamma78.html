Suppose the thief sold all of the stolen animal, except one-hundredth of it, or slaughtered it and made a mistake in the slaughtering so that it became non-kosher in his hands. In that case, he pays the twofold payment of an ordinary thief but doesn't pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: A Thief by Fernando Botero</div>
