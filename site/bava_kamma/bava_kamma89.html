Still, if she dies during her husband's lifetime, he will receive nothing. Since the buyer takes a significant risk in making such a purchase, the price he pays is steeply discounted from the face value of the Ketubah.</div>

<div>
Such a sale should not be made because a man is not allowed to keep his wife even for one hour without a Ketubah.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If the wife injures her husband, he can't collect this speculative value of the Ketubah.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Encounter by Matisse</div>
