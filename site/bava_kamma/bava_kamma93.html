Even if the first person added, "on condition that there will be no liability," the assailant is nevertheless liable.<br />
<br />
If one says to his fellow, "Tear my garment," the damager is liable, but if the owner added, "on condition that there will be no liability," - the damager is not liable.<br />
<br />
If one steals pieces of wood and makes them into utensils, he pays the value as of the time of the robbery.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;Frans Mortelmans - The Carpenter</span></div>
