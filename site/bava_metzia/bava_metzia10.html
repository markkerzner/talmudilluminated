Formal methods of acquisition, or coming into legal possession of a movable object, include lifting it, but they do not include falling on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Later, Rabbis instituted another method of acquisition, where four cubits (about 6 feet) would acquire ownerless objects for the person so that people would not come to quarrel with one another. Then why, in the case above, he didn't acquire through the four cubits rule? Because it works only in the public area, but he was in someone's field.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Fallen by the Wayside by Edgar Bundy</div>
