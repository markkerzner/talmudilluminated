He can, however, demand compensation from the next resident.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If one rents a house to his fellow for a year, and the year was then proclaimed a leap year, that is, an extra month was added, the tenant need not pay additional rent because of it. If, however, he rented the house to the tenant by the month, and the year was then proclaimed a leap year, the tenant must pay rent for the extra month. The last ruling is obvious and is only taught for the sake of completeness.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art: Kibbutz Regavim's Abandoned Synagogue by Hayim Shtayer</span></div>
