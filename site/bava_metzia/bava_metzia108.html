An outsider who wants to buy a field can easily find another one, but a neighbor gains significantly from being able to buy an adjoining field. This rule is based on "</span><a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/6-18.htm"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">You shall do what is right and good in the eyes of God</span></a>,"<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;which commands one to go beyond the letter of the law.</span><br />

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If one wants to buy a field and inquires of the neighbor of that field if he can do it, and the neighbor allows it,  a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-45-coins-used-for-symbolic.html">formal act of acquisition</a> is still required, or else the neighbor can later claim that had he come to buy the land, he would be asked a higher price, but that he never meant to relinquish his right.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art: A Village Landscape With Farmers by Pieter The Younger Brueghel</span></div>
