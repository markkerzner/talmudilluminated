They divide the wood, the stones, and the earth (used as cement) in proportion to the heights of their respective properties.<br /><br />To allocate the whole and the broken stones, we determine how each wall collapsed. If it collapsed directly downward, presumably, the lower stones broke, and the rest of the wall fell upon them, so the whole stones were allotted to the owner of the upper story. If the wall was knocked over to the side, presumably, the upper stones broke, and the owner of the ground floor gets the whole ones.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Italian Ruins by Ivan Nikolaevich Kramskoy</span></div>
