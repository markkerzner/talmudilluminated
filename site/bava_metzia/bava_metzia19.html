One possible correct way is&nbsp;to stipulate that the gift takes effect "from today and after death."<div><br /></div><div>Under this clause, the gift is granted to its beneficiary in two stages: the property itself is given immediately, and the benefactor relinquishes his right to transfer it to anyone else. However, the right to the property's yield (i.e., including such things as produce and rental income) is not granted to the beneficiary until the benefactor's death. Thus, the benefactor continues to use his property for the remainder of his life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: A Bloomsbury Family by Sir William Orpen</div>
