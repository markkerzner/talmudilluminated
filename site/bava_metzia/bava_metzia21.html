Therefore, the following objects belong to the finder: scattered produce, scattered coins, small sheaves in the public domain, round cakes of pressed figs, and baker's loaves.<br />
<br />
When someone loses such an object, but before he discovers his loss - Rava says that the thing is already abandoned, but Abaye disagrees. The law in this case follows Abaye: until the owner has consciously despaired of recovering the lost object, the finder is not permitted to keep it.<br />
