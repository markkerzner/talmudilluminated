Examples include produce in a container or a container as is, homemade loaves of bread, jugs of wine, and jugs of oil - these used to have individual seals.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If one found young pigeons tied with a rope behind a wall - which provides partial protection - he should not touch them.
