For example, a rooster or calf needs to be fed but can not do anything to earn their keep. They should be sold, and the money should be held for the owner. If an animal works and eats, such as an ox or donkey, it should be put to work for twelve months and sold. One may use that money, so if it is lost, he is responsible.<br />

If one found books (scrolls), he should read from them once in thirty days to air them out and prevent their decay.<br />
