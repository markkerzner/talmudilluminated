Likely, the borrower would like to repay but doesn't have the complete amount, so he admits to a part, thinking of repaying the rest later. So, the Torah imposed an oath to force him to tell the truth.

Likewise, if witnesses testified that the borrower owes part of the loan, he has to take an oath for the rest.</span><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: 100%;">Art: A Private Letter by Robert W. Wright</span></div></div>
