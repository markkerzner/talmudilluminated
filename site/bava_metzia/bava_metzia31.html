If he found a donkey or  a cow grazing by the road, this is not considered a lost object. This is a lost object if he found a donkey with its gear overturned or a cow running through the vineyards.</div>

If one returned an animal and it ran away, and this happened four or five times, he is still obligated to return it yet again because it is stated, "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">return, you shall return them</a>..." For missed work, he gets  compensation only as a laborer. But if he stipulates his wage in court, he can get it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Sand Asses by Henry Weekes</div>
