<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">The unpaid<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">&nbsp;custodian</a> must safeguard the object but not use it and is liable for any loss caused by his negligence;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">The paid custodian also may not use the object, but because he is being paid, he is liable even for theft or loss not due to his negligence;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">The renter pays for the right to use another's property, and his liability is identical to that of the paid custodian;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-14.htm">Borrower</a> bears the highest degree of responsibility - he is liable even for mishaps beyond his control, with the exception of work-related damages.</span></li></ul><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Protecting The School Children by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Andre-Henri-Dargelas</span></div>
