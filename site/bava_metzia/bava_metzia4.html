<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Rabbi Chiya says that the defendant has admitted part of the claim and has to take an oath.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Rav. Sheshet says the fifty zuz are viewed as if the lender is holding them. The defendant admits nothing about them and completely denies the other fifty. Thus, there is no oath, and he is not liable for anything else.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: The Argument by Norman Rockwell</div>
