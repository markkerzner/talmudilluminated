Thus, when Rav Pappa wanted to transfer the ownership of 12,000 golden coins to his agent, he used a method of acquisition "by dint of land," where he transferred the money together with a piece of land. Incidentally, he needed the agent to be the owner so that the people who owed him the sum would not hesitate to give the money to his agent.</div>
