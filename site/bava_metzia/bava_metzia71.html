<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">This prohibition is because if the financier becomes used to taking interest, he may come to take it from Jews, too. Excluded are cases of minor interest, "enough to live on," and Torah scholars who know the law and will not come to take interest from the Jews. Later on, taking interest from non-Jews became permitted since it was not possible otherwise.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art: King Solomon by Simeon Solomon</span></div>
