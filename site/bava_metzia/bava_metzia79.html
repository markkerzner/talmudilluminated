<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">What are the circumstances? If the contract was for a specific boat and any wine, the renter should get back the fee since the owner cannot provide the boat.  And if the contract was for any boat and specific wine, the owner should keep the fee since the renter can't provide the same wine.</span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">However, the case here is that the contract was for a specific boat and a specific wine. Since each party can blame the other for not fulfilling the contract, the payment stays where it is now.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Boat At Low Tide At Fecamp by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Claude Oscar Monet</span></div>
