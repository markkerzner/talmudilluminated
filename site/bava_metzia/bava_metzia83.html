Rabbah bar bar Chanan took their cloaks as payment.<br /><br />The porters went to Rav's court and told him about it. Rav told Rabbah bar bar Chanan, "Give them back their cloaks." "Is that the law?" - he asked. "Yes," - said Rav, quoting from Proverbs, "<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-20.htm" target="_blank">So that&nbsp;you go on the path of good people</a>..."<br /><br />They said to Rav, "We are poor people, and we labored the entire day; we are starving and have nothing to eat." Rav told Rabbah bar bar Chanan, "Pay them their fee." "Is that the law?" - he asked. "Yes," - said Rav, quoting the end of the phrase, "...and keep the ways of the righteous."</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 20.8px;">Algerian Water Carrier by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">William Sartain</span></div>
