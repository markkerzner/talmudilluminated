Resh Lakish, a highwayman, mistook him for a  woman and jumped after. Rabbi Yochanan told Resh Lakish that he had a sister even more beautiful than him, and if Resh Lakish decided to study Torah, he could marry her.<br /><br />Resh Lakish became a great scholar. Once, they discussed when weapons are considered finished and therefore susceptible to ritual impurity. Rabbi Yochanan said, "When they are hardened," but Resh Lakish said, "When they are polished." Rabbi Yochanan said,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 20.8px;">"</span>Robber knows his trade<span style="font-size: 20.8px;">"</span>&nbsp;- as praise, but Resh Lakish misunderstood and said,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 20.8px;">"</span>And what have you given me? I was called Teacher among robbers also.<span style="font-size: 20.8px;">"</span>&nbsp;Rabbi Yochanan was displeased, and Resh Lakish died. Rabbi Yochanan was inconsolable about losing his student, and his mind became disturbed. The Sages asked for mercy on him, and he departed.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 20.8px;">Boys Bathing by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 130%;">Henry Scott Tuke</span></div>
