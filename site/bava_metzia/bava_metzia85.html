After his death, Rebbi traveled to his locale and asked if he had any sons left. They told Rebbi that the son of Rabbi Tarfon's daughter was alive and that every harlot whose own price was two coins would hire him for eight. Rebbi told him, "If you repent, I will give you my daughter in marriage." He repented but did not marry her so that people would not say he repented just because of her.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Why did Rebbi go to such lengths to teach his friends' children? The one who teaches his fellow's son Torah merits to learn in the Heavenly Academy, and the one who teaches the son of an ignoramus can cancel decrees that God makes.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art: The Three Candles by Marc Chagall</span></div><div><br /></div>
