It is implied that he had it in mind when he picked it up, not that he changed his mind later.</div><div><br /></div><div>If, however, after he had given it to the rider, he said, "I acquired it first," he has said nothing; that is, his claim is dismissed, and the rider may keep it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Carte Blanche by Renee Magritte</div>
