Rabbah said: "Even Rabbi Shimon, who permits using the firstborn donkey before redeeming it with a sheep, agrees that after decapitation it can't be used. What is the reason? Compare it to a calf that was <i>decapitated</i> to atone for an unsolved murder case; this calf was buried in the valley and not used. So too the <i>decapitated</i> donkey cannot be used."
<br />
<br />
How does Rabbah know Rabbi Shimon's opinion? Because in the list of foods that can become impure Rabbi Shimon does not include the meat of a decapitated donkey. We must conclude that Rabbi Shimon deems it forbidden for benefit, thus, one cannot sell it even for others to eat. However, the Talmud rejects his proof: perhaps donkey meat is not food simply because people don't usually eat it? This attack is parried: the prohibition of the Torah to eat it elevates it to the status of food.
<br />
<br />
And Rabbah? "Since he caused loss to a kohen, his donkey should now be lost to him" describes the position of Rabbi Shimon.
