Why is this? The Torah said about a redeemed sacrifice, "You can eat it, like a deer or an ibex." The extra word "deer" teaches us that it is not subject to the laws of firstborn, just as a deer is not subject to them, and the extra word "ibex" - that the kohen's gifts need not be given - just as they need not be given from an ibex.
<br />
<br />
The redeemed animal cannot be shorn or put to work, and its milk is prohibited. Why? The Torah said, "you may slaughter it" - but not shear it or work with it, "for its meat" - but not drink its milk. Finally, "and you will eat" teaches that you may not give it to your dogs. In general, an animal that's once been a consecrated may not be redeemed with the purpose of feeding it to the dogs.
