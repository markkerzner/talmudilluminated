However, right after this, Beit Hillel allowed more ways to get doves out of a dovecote. The question is around the joy of the Holiday: which school, of Shammai or of Hillel, wants to enhance it more?
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan said, "It is a mistake! Somebody transmitted their opinions incorrectly, and Beit Shammai should be stricter, as they are wont to be. " But this is not necessarily so. It could be that Beit Shammai allows slaughtering and covering the blood only in that specific case, where there is a spade already in the ground, so there is no reason to prohibit it, but normally they would be stricter. 
<br />
<br />
Beit Hillel, in its turn, permits using a ladder to get to the dovecote because it is obviously a ladder for that, not for plastering the roof. But in other cases, they may follow a different logic, not necessarily trying to be lenient. The Talmud finds five more contradictions where Rabbi Yochanan claims that it is a mistake, but the Talmud can explain the opinions as they are recorded without reversing them.
