What is its status? Can it be eaten? We have two opinions. One is that it is muktzeh (set aside) - since before it hatched, it was not fit for any use. The other opinion is that it is permitted: if one were to slaughter it, it would become permitted as food - and this permission removes the prohibition of muktzeh.
<br />
<br />
But why would it be muktzeh? We know that a calf born on a Yom Tov can definitely be eaten, so what is the difference between it and an egg? - The answer would be that the calf was permitted even while inside its mother - if one slaughtered the mother. This logic obviously does not apply to the chick.
<br />
<br />
There is also the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov, who says that the chick is prohibited even on a weekday - all the time that it has not opened its eyes. This is because, before this time, it is not properly a bird but a creepy-crawly and is prohibited together with other "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=11#P3037">things that creep upon the earth</a>."<br />
