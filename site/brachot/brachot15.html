Rabbi Yochanan taught: "One who wishes to accept on himself Heaven's sovereignty in a complete manner, should relieve himself and wash his hands, don tefillin, then say the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a>, and the Amidah (Standing) prayer - and this is complete acceptance."
<br />
<br />
If one said the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a>, but did not make it audible to his ears - this not the perfect way, but it counts. Rabbi Yose disagrees and says that he has not fulfilled his obligation and will have to repeat the Shema. What is the argument? Rabbi Yose says that the word "Shema" itself, which means "Hear" teaches that one should hear his words. And the first teacher (usually it is Rabbi Meir), what does he say? He says, "Shema," or "Hear" means "Understand" and tells us that one can say the Shema in any language that he understands. And Rabbi Yose? He surelly agrees that one can say the Shema in any language!? - He says that the word "Shema" actually carries both lessons: that one must hear his words and that one can recite the Shema in any language that he understands.
