Since David also said, "My eyes preceded the watches," we see that there are still two watches left at midnight. However, David's real schedule was as follows: during the first part of the night he would sleep like a horse, whose sleep is always light - that is, he would study Torah with occasional catnaps, and since midnight he arose strong as a lion, to sing praises. For that, David had a harp near his bed, and at midnight the northern wind would come and play on it, to wake him up.
<br />
<br />
David praised himself, "Guard my soul, for I am devout." He meant, "All the kings of East and West sleep until three hours into the day, but I arise at midnight, to give thanks to You." Some say, he meant, "All kings sit with honorable advisors, and my hands are soiled with blood, looking at the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">niddah</a> stains, embryos, and afterbirths, to declare a woman pure for her husband. Not only that, but I will agree if my decision is incorrect."
<br />
<br />
The Sages <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">required saying the Shema before midnight</a>.&nbsp;Why? This is later than people going to bed, but earlier than the sleep ends! - They wanted to distance a man from an error, lest he comes home and decides to eat a little and sleep a little, and then miss the evening Shema, and anybody who transgresses the words of the Sages deserves to be bitten by a snake. Why suddenly so strong a statement? Because of the danger of sleep.
