Who diversifies the creatures," and on seeing very beautiful creatures or trees he says "Blessed are You... Who has such in His world." On strong winds, hurricanes and earthquakes one says, "Blessed are You... Whose strength and power fills the world." 
<br />
<br />
When one sees the sun in exactly the same position as it was when it was first created, one says, "Blessed are You... who makes the work of creation," and this blessing occurs once every twenty-eight years, with the last having been said in 2009.
<br />
<br />
When a good event happens, one says "Blessed are You... Who allowed me to reach this day," and when others are also sharing as partners in his joy, he says, "Blessed are You... Who is good and does good."
<br />
<br />
For example, if they tell one that his father died, he should first say "Blessed are You... the true judge," and then "Blessed are You... Who allowed me to reach this day," because of inheritance, and if he has others who inherit together with him, he says, "Blessed are You... Who is good and does good" instead.
