He reached a city where no one would provide lodging for him. He said, "All that God does is for the good." He went to sleep in the fields. He had a rooster, a donkey, and a lamp. The wind came and blew out the lamp; a cat came and ate the rooster; a lion came and ate the donkey. At night, the army came and captured the city. He told his students, "Didn't I tell you, all that God does is for good."</div><div><br /></div><div>Once, the Roman Empire decreed that Jews should not engage in Torah study. Pappus came and found Rabbi Akiva publicly teaching the Torah. Pappus said, "Akiva, are you not afraid of the regime?" Akiva answered with a parable. A fox saw schools of fish looking for a refuge. It said, "Why are you running away?" The fish replied, "From the people spreading their nets." The fox said, "Come live with me on dry land." The fish replied, "If we are in danger in water, how much more so would be on land!"&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If now, when we study the Torah, which says, "<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm" target="_blank">For it is your life and the length of your days</a>," we are in danger, if we stop studying, how much more so!?</div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;A Scholar in His Study by the School of Rembrandt</div>
