This is actually an obligation: one must make merry. One of the ways of doing so is by bringing the "celebration" sacrifice (chagigah) and eating the meat.
<br />
<br />
More specifically, one must come to the Temple during a Holiday. Having arrived, one should bring a sacrifice because the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2157" target="_blank">Do not appear before Me empty-handed</a>." But who is this "one?" In other words, who is obligated to visit the Temple and bring the sacrifice?<br />
<br />
All males are obligated to go to the Temple, following the commandment of "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2159" target="_blank">Three times a year every male must appear before God, the Master of the Universe</a>." Women and minors do not have to go. Also not included are people of undetermined sex (tumtum), hermaphrodite, a deaf-mute, deranged, and one who physically can't walk up the Temple Mount.<br />
<br />
Why does the rule start with "All males" if later it gives all the details? - This is to silently include an additional class of people, half-free and half-slave. We have <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/08/daf-in-100-words-gittin-41_21.html" target="_blank">discussed this unique situation before</a>: this person cannot marry a slave woman because he is free but cannot marry a free woman because he is a slave. He does not have to visit the Temple either. However, the Sages later establishes that the court should force the slave's master to free the half-slave part.<br />
