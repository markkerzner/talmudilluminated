<span style="font-size: medium;">It is prohibited to eat a limb taken from an animal while it was alive. Even if the animal is later slaughtered, the limb retains its prohibited status. This applies to both kosher and non-kosher animals - so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar, but the Sages say that this prohibition applies only to kosher animals.
<br /><br />
Both opinions are derived from the same source. The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=12#P5258">Only be strong not to eat blood, for the blood is the life, you shall not eat the life with the flesh</a>." Just as blood is forbidden in kosher and non-kosher animals, so is the limb torn from a live animal - so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar. And the Sages? They say that "You shall not eat the life with the flesh" indeed prohibits a limb, but it should be such an animal that "flesh without life" should be permitted - that is, a kosher animal, whose meat may be eaten.
<br /><br />
How much of a limb one has to eat to transgress? - An olive's volume. Alternatively, a complete limb, a "creation," even if smaller than an olive's volume, makes him liable also.
