<span style="font-size: medium;">One may wrap meat and cheese in one cloth, as long as they don't touch one another. Now, even if they did touch, what would be the problem? If they are wet, they would have to be washed before eating, and a person might forget to do so.
<br />
<br />
Two people in a restaurant may eat at one table, one meat and the other one cheese. That is true for strangers, who don't share food with each other. However, if they know each other and may share food, they need an additional reminder, something placed on the table.
<br />
<br />
Two brothers who are on bad terms and are particular not to eat from one another, can they eat meat and cheese at the same table? On the one hand, if we allow them to eat together, people will wonder, why all other brothers are not allowed to eat meat and cheese at one table, and these are? On the other hand, someone who has only one shirt would be allowed to wash it on a weekday of a Holiday, while others are forbidden. However, the last is not a good comparison, because his situation is special, and this is evident to all.
