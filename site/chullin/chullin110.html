<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav once heard a certain housewife ask her friend, "How much milk is required to cook a pound of meat?" On hearing this, Rav enacted in Sura a law prohibiting eating the udder altogether. He also established there an academy that lasted for 800 years.
<br />
<br />
Rami bar Tamrei visited Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur. The people, preparing a pre-Yom Kippur meal, threw the udders into the street, and he collected and ate them. They brought him to Rav Chisda, where the following dialog ensued.
<br />
<br />
Ch: Why did you eat the udders in violation of the local custom?<br />
R: I am from a place of Rav Yehudah, who allows to eat udders.<br />
Ch: But don't you agree to the rule that if you are in a place of a more stringent custom, you don't violate it?<br />
R: I ate them outside the city limit.<br />
Ch: And with what did you roast the udders?<br />
R: With grape pits that I found near a winepress.<br />
Ch: But perhaps they were from wine use for libations?<br />
R: They were older than 12 months and thus permitted for benefit.<br />
Ch: But perhaps they were stolen goods?<br />
R: The owners abandoned them, there were nettles sprouting there.
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda saw that Rami was not wearing tefilin.
<br />
<br />
Ch: Why are you not wearing tefilin?<br />
R: He (that is, I) suffers from stomach ailment.<br />
Ch: And why are not wearing tsitzit fringes?<br />
R: My garment is borrowed.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, they brought a person to be punished with lashes, because he refused to honor his parents. Rami said, "Release him!" There is no punishment for a commandment if a reward for it is mentioned next to it in the Torah. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Chisda relented and said, "I see that you are very sharp." Rami replied, "If you would be in Rav Yehudah's city, I would show you my sharpness!"
