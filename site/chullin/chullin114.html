<span style="font-size: medium;">From the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=23#P2161">You shall not cook a young goat in the milk of its mother</a>" we only know that it is prohibited to cook it in the milk of a she-goat. How do we know this for the milk of a cow or an ewe? - We can derive this logically: if the young goat's own mother, with whom he can have offspring, is nevertheless so strict that it is prohibited to cook him in its milk, then a cow, with whom he is not allowed to have offspring (for that would be prohibited interbreeding) - her milk certainly cannot be used to cook him!
<br />
<br />
However, this logic is flawed. There is a stringency with the young goat and its mother: they cannot be killed on one day. This stringency is not found in regards to the goat kid and a cow who is a complete stranger to him. Thus, with our logic disproved, we need another way to derive the prohibition - and it is derived from the second repetition of "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=34#P2520">don't cook a young goat in its mother milk</a>," which, his mother being already prohibited, now teaches us the same law about a cow.
