<br />
Why would Rav silence someone? Could it be because Rav subscribes to the view of Rabbi Yehudah, who only allows to eat this food after Shabbat, whereas the student recited the view of Rabbi Meir, who allows to eat it immediately? - No! This cannot be. Just because Rav himself does not agree to someone's point of view, he would never silence a person reciting it, since it was a logically valid opinion held by Rabbi Meir. Rather, Rav silenced him because he misunderstood Rabbi Meir's point of view. He actually recited the rule as applicable to slaughter. Said Rav to him, "Do not think that Rabbi Meir allows to eat meat slaughtered on Shabbat, just as he allows to eat cooked food. For the food could be eaten even uncooked, but the animal could not be eaten if not slaughtered."<br />
