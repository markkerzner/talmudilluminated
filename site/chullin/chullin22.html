Turtledoves are migratory birds, but pigeons dwell permanently in the land. A turtledove must be mature to be fit for  a sacrifice, but a pigeon is acceptable only before it reaches maturity. We therefore have the following rules.<br />
<br />
What is acceptable in the case of turtledoves is unacceptable in the case of pigeons, and vice versa. The beginning of yellowing in both types is unacceptable. That is when a turtledove is not fully mature yet, and a pigeon begins to become mature. The reason for this is that the Torah calls pigeons "bnei yonah," "sons of pigeons"; conversely, we understand that turtledoves must be mature.<br />
<br />
But logic should dictate otherwise: if turtledoves, which are not acceptable when young, are acceptable when mature, then pigeons, which are acceptable when young, should surely be acceptable when old! To dispel this, the Torah never called a pigeon a pigeon, but only a "son of a pigeon" to emphasize that only young ones are acceptable.<br />
