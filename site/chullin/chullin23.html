Rabbi Zeira asked, "Is this for sure or out of doubt?" Meaning, if one promised a bird burnt offering and then brought a turtledove and a pigeon with yellowing feathers, is at least one of them valid, or, because it is a bird in a class by itself, neither is valid?<br />
<br />
Try this answer: the Torah said "sacrifices … from birds," and this means that some birds are excluded. Which ones? Isn't it ones with yellowing feathers? - No! Excluded are <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/02/zevachim-85-these-must-be-removed-from.html">birds that were sodomized</a> or worshiped, and Rabbi Zeira does not get an answer.<br />
<br />
He asked a similar question about sheep. A sheep younger than twelve months is a lamb, one older than thirteen is a ram, what is its status in between? Does it require libations like either a lamb or  a ram, or is it a separate creature with no libations? Again, no answer. He also asked about dough in intermediate stages of leavening, can it be brought as part of a thanksgiving offering.<br />
