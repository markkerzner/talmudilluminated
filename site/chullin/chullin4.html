<br />
Rav Anan said that even a Jew who worships idols - which is considered as an abandonment of the whole Torah - can still do shechitah. We know this because Yehoshaphat, the righteous king of Judah, <a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/18-2.htm">partook of the feast of idol worshiping Ahab, who thus enticed him to join forces in battle</a>.<br />
<br />
But perhaps Ahab slaughtered the animals, but Yehoshaphat did not eat them? - There is no enticement with mere words. Incidentally, although the Torah says "if your brother will entice you (to idol worship)" - that too is done with food and drink. But was not God upset with Satan for enticing Him against Job, without food? - God is different, since He does not eat anyway.<br />
<br />
Back to Yehoshaphat, perhaps he only drank but did not eat? - It is not fitting for a king to drink but not eat at a feast.<br />
