This point of view argues against <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/08/chullin-40-slaughter-done-for-sake-of.html">what Rav Huna said about slaughter in front of idol</a>.<br />
<br />
This opinion also argues against the concept of kosher wine. According to it, if a Jew owns the wine, it never becomes non-kosher, even if touched or processed by non-Jews. However, it does not become law, and it was not mentioned in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/search/label/Avodah%20Zarah">whole tractate of Avodah Zarah</a>.<br />
<br />
One may not slaughter into a sea or into a river, because it may seem that he is slaughtering to the spirit of the sea or the river. One may slaughter into a pool of water, because blood mixed with water would never be used in idol worship.<br />
<br />
If one slaughters a regular animal in the name of some free-will offering, then people may confuse it with an actual offering, and the shechitah is declared non-kosher.<br />
