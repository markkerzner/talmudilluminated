There is another way, however: a post. This post is placed next to the alley's exit, and it serves the same purpose: either it reminds the residents of alley's courtyards that the alley is different from the street, or it serves as the beginning of the fourth wall, separating the alley from the street.
<br />
<br />
Ordinarily, this post is places partially in the alley and partially in the street, so that it is visible both from the inside and outside the alley. However, what if one placed it completely outside the alley? The people inside then won't think that it is a reminder, for it looks to them as the continuation of the alley's wall. Still, does this post help, since at least it works for the people outside?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud finds a proof that it helps, then a disproof, and then concludes that it helps. How could it be - we just found a disproof!? - Since Rabbi Chiya was the one who offered a proof, and his explanations are based on the teaching of his uncle, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who wrote down all of the rules, then he is more trustworthy.
