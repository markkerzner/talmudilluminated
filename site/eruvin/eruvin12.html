This, however, is the opinion of Beit Hillel. By contrast, Beit Shammai require more: both a crossbeam and a side-post.
<br />
<br />
What is the reason for their disagreement, and what can we deduce from here about their basic points of view? Shall we say that Beit Shammai consider an area private only if it is surrounded by four walls, and that is why for  a three-walled alley they require an additional quasi-wall made of a crossbeam and a side post? - No! You cannot deduce this with certainty. It could be that in Beit Shammai's view three walls already create a private domain, so much so that one who throws an object from the street into an alley will already be liable for Shabbat violation. However, the Sages safeguarded the Shabbat by requiring further adjustment to the alley.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Beit Hillel require a beam in place of the fourth wall - is it clear to them that the third wall surely cannot be substituted by a beam, which means that three walls are a minimum to make a private domain? Again, not necessarily. It could be that Beit Hillel consider two walls sufficient, and will in fact make one liable for throwing an object into a two-walled partition. However, to permit carrying inside an alley they require a third wall and also a beam in place of the fourth.
<br />
<br />
Thus, we remain without definitive conclusions about their points of view.
