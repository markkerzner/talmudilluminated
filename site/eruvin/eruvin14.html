What is the source for their disagreement? - The first teacher considers the crossbeam to be a reminder, thus, it has to be somewhat serious; Rabbi Yehudah says it is a symbolic fourth wall, and only has to look right.
<br />
<br />
By contrast, if one uses a side-post to delineate where the alley ends and the street begins - that side-post only has to be ten hand-breadths high, but it can be as thin as a thread. A side-post is more unusual than a crossbeam, and thus serves its purpose, whether as a symbolic wall or as a reminder.
