<br />
<br />
Any kind of food can be used for the eruv, except for water and salt - since they do not properly nourish. Incidentally, one who vowed to abstain for nourishment can still drink water and eat salt. The food does not have to be edible by the owner, as long as others can eat it. For example, one can make an eruv of wine for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazirite">nazirite</a>: even though he is prohibited to drink wine, others can. Similarly, one can make eruv of terumah (Kohen's portion) for a regular Jew: even though he cannot eat it, but a Kohen can.
<br />
<br />
One can make an eruv with meat cooked rare - since some people eat it, and with raw eggs - again, since they are eaten under certain circumstances. How many eggs would be needed? Since the eruv should be sufficient for two meals, two eggs will constitute an eruv.
