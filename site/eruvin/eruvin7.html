<h1>Eruvin 7 - Strict or lenient</h1>

The Sages of Nehardea told them an unexpectedly strict ruling: they had to put up two doors, one at each of the two bends. This followed the strictness of Rav, who required the door shape (although not an actual door), but also the strictness of Shmuel, who in a different situation required an actual door, although he did not need it in the case of a bent alley.
<br />
<br />
How could the Sages do this? They could completely follow either Rav or Shmuel, and that would be fine. Had they followed the leniencies of both, they would be called dishonest, and for following the contradictory stringencies they should be by right called stupid, and the phrase, "A fool walks in darkness" would apply to them.
<br />
<br />
Actually, they followed Rav, but since the two door shapes are not easily noticeable, there was a danger that the people will not understand the fix and will behave leniently in other, different situations. As far as being called a fool for following multiple stringencies, this is only true if it can bring one to violate other laws, but not if they can co-exist.
