Rich - because they do not transgress - do not refrain from helping with a loan. Poor, because it helps them obtain a loan.<p></p><p>Prosbul works by assigning the loan to court for collection. It is then "as if collected," and such a loan is not canceled by the 7th year.</p><p>Only unsecured loans are canceled and thus require prosbul. Even if a debt is canceled by the 7th year, it is meritorious to return the money as a gift.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Thankful Poor by Henry Ossawa Tanner</p>
