In all three cases, the Get is void because the husband stipulated  that it would take effect after his death, and this is impossible.<br />
<br />
If he said, "This is your Get from today if I die from this illness," - it is a valid Get. It takes effect retroactively, but care must be taken not to invalidate the Get by living together.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; white-space-collapse: preserve;">The Convalescent by Carolus-Duran</span></div>
