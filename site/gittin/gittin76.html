The condition was based on need, and the need was fulfilled.<br />
<br />
If a man told his wife, "This is your Get on condition that you nurse my son for two years," and the son died, the <span>Get is void</span>. The husband wanted to harass her and failed. <span>Other</span><span>s say</span> that the husband wanted to profit and that the <span>Get is valid</span>. Practically, we rule stringently, but they should have been more specific!<div><br /></div><div>Art: Cardinal Richelieu on his Deathbed by Philippe de Champaigne</div>
