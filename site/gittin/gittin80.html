<br />
According to Rabbi Meir, the woman must leave her new husband if she re-married but can not return to her previous husband. She also loses her Ketubah payment from both and many other benefits.<br />
<br />
However, the prevailing ruling is that she does need another Get but is not penalized as above.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Bathsheba Receiving David's Letter by Jan Steen</div>
