<br />
If one divorces his wife and says to her, "You are hereby permitted to any man but so-and-so," she is not divorced. What should he do? He should take the Get from  her, give it to her again, and say, "You are hereby permitted to any man."<br />
<br />
But if he wrote this restriction into the Get itself, although he later erased it, the Get is invalid since it never was a "document of severance."<div><br /></div><div><div>Art: A Seated Woman in an Interior Gazing out of the Window by Thomas Wyck</div></div><div><br /></div>
