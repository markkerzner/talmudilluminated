Rabbi Eliezer's learning was supreme, but many Rabbis reunited to disprove his teaching after his death. However, all but one of their rebuttals had potential flaws.<br />

According to Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria, this teaches that temporary conditions in the Get are valid but not permanent ones.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Portrait of an Old Man by Rembrandt</div>
