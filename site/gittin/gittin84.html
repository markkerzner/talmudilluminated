If she does marry, she need not divorce. She should not marry others because this may invalidate the Get.<br />
<br />
"On condition that you have relations with so-and-so" is valid because she can bribe him to marry her for a time. "On condition that you have relations with my father, or your father" is invalid because she can not bribe the father, so it is to vex her, and the Get is valid.<br /><br /><div>Art: An Elegant Woman at St. Malo by Vittorio Matteo Corcos&nbsp;</div>
