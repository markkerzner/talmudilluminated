On the subject of good omens, if one wants to know if he will live out the year or not, he should kindle a lamp during the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, in a house where no wind blows. If the light continues to burn for as long as there is oil in the lamp, we know that he will live out the year.<br />
<br />
If one wants to undertake a business venture and wants to know if it will be successful or not, let him raise a rooster for the sake of that business venture and let him see: if the rooster grows plump and fine, it is  a good omen that he will be successful.<br />
<br />
If one wants to go out on the road and wants to know if he will return home safely or not, let him stand in a dark house. If he sees a shadow of his shadow, know that he will return home successfully.<br />
<br />
And it is not a wise thing for one to do, for if the omen is negative, he may become distressed, and his luck might indeed take a turn for the worst. For this reason, the omens are formulated to consider only the good outcome.<br />
