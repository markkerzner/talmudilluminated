However, some of his seven decrees were hotly contested. Here is one example.
<br />
<br />
By Torah law, when a man dies, only his sons get a portion of his inheritance, not his daughters. The Sages changed this in favor of the daughters: if there is enough money in the estate, the daughters are supported until they marry or grow up, and the sons divide the rest of the inheritance; but if there is not enough money, then the daughters are supported from whatever there is, and the sons can go begging.
<br />
<br />
Admon argued: just because they are males, they should lose all? Instead, divide the estate equally! - but the Sages still did not agree, and their logic was that the boys could look for sustenance easier than the girls.
<br />
<br />
Another example is if the bride's father promised money to his son-in-law as dowry but defaulted, the son-in-law can insist on his rights and say that he is not marrying until the promise is paid - or until the bride's hair turns white. 
<br />
<br />
Admon suggested that the bride should argue thus: "I could understand this if it was I who promised the money, but it is my father, so what am I to do?" She can then force the groom to either marry her or write her a Get releasing her. This reasoning of Admon was accepted.
