<h1>Ketubot 24 - Collusion</h1>

If one says, "I am a Kohen," and the other says, "I am a Kohen," - we do not believe him. But if they testify about each other, they are accepted.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: we should never establish a person as a Kohen (to allow him to eat Kohen's portion) through the words of one witness, especially here, where they may have colluded to testify for each other.
<br />
<br />
But is it true that Rabbi Yehudah suspects collusion? Didn't we learn this case: if two vendors of produce come to a town, and one of them says, "My produce is not properly tithed, however, his produce is" - we do not believe his testimony because we suspect that in the next town they will say the reverse, and this is a ploy to inspire credibility, and here Rabbi Yehudah permits to buy their produce. But he should suspect them and forbid it! 
<br />
<br />
Explained Rav Adda bar Ahavah, "Someone has learned this ruling about vendors wrong. He exchanged his opinion. Exchange them back, and Rabbi Yehudah is the one who suspects collusion."
<br />
<br />
Abaye said, "No need to exchange opinions! Rather, here it is different because vendors are selling doubtful tithes, "d'mai," and this is not such a strict prohibition, so Rabbi Yehudah believes them anyway. Then how do the Sages disbelieve? - They say that if he has his wares, weights, and scales, it is evident that he denigrates his produce only because of collusion.
