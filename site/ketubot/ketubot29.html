He is also liable to regular damages for assault: pain, humiliation, and depreciation. Furthermore, if she and her father desire, he must marry her and may never divorce her against her will.
<br />
<br />
This law applies primarily to a young girl who just became a bat mitzvah (12 years) and thus an adult but has not become a more grown-up (12 Â½ years). The penalty still applies if he rapes a girl who is a mamzer and whom he is prohibited from marrying. It also applies to all who were converted or ransomed before they were three years of age. 
<br />
<br />
Similarly, if one violates girls prohibited to him on pain of karet (being cut off from the people) - such as his sister, brother's wife divorced before chuppah, or a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">niddah</a> - the penalty is the same.
