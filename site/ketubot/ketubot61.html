However, it is still advisable for her to prepare his wine, spread his bed, and assist with the washing of his hands, feet, and face because these are the signs of endearment - this was the advice of Rav Yitchak bar Chananiya.
<br />
<br />
He also added that the wife should not do these three things when she is a niddah - to not&nbsp;endear him too much. However, she can do them with a change or when not in front of him. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yitchak ben Chananiya also said that a waiter serving food must be allowed to try some of it, which refers to meat that gives off a pleasing odor and to pungent wine - or else the waiter will suffer from craving. Others say that this refers to all savory foods. There was a righteous man who would give the waiter from every course - and Elijah the Project would speak to him, while another righteous man only gave from one, and from the rest- after the meal, and with him, Elijah would not talk.

<br />
There was once a Roman who wanted to marry a particular woman, but she refused. He started eating pomegranates in front of her, and as she swallowed the saliva produced by her desire for it, she finally became all bloated. He made her promise that if he cured her, she would marry him. Then he brought more pomegranates and started eating these, saying, "All saliva that causes you discomfort, spit it out, spit it out!" She did so until something like a green palm leaf shot out of her, and she became healed.
