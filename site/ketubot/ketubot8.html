First is the blessing on the wine. Then, "Blessed is the One who created everything for His glory." Just as God acted as the best friend at Adam and Eve's wedding, those assembled at the wedding also emulate God.
<br />
<br />
Then, "Who created man" (at first alone), and "Who made a man in His image, and built - hint to a woman -- a building for eternity" - since with a woman there is a continuous cycle of births and weddings.
<br />
<br />
Then, "the barren one should rejoice" - This is Jerusalem, whose needs are to be remembered, especially in the happy moments. Then "Please gladden the hearts of the bride and groom just as You gladdened Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden." 
<br />
<br />
And then, "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who created joy and gladness, groom and bride, mirth, song, pleasure, delight, love, brotherhood, peace, and companionship. May there be heard in the cities of Judah and in the city of Jerusalem sounds of joy and gladness, voices of groom and bride. Blessed are You Who gladdens a groom with the bride" - referring to the man's joy with his wife.
