She collects two payments. 
<br />
<br />
However, if she produces two Ketubah documents but only one Get, we assume they are from one marriage, but he simply wrote another Ketubah for her. She collects only one. Finally, if she has two Get documents from him but only one Ketubah, he must have married (and divorced) her again, but anybody who re-marries his wife relies on the original Ketubah, so she again collects only one payment.
<br />
<br />
If one was married to two wives and died, and did not leave enough to pay both, then the Ketubah of the first way has priority over the Ketubah of the second. If the wives died before collecting their Ketubah payments, then the heirs of the first wife have priority over the heirs of the second one.
