<h1>Ketubot 92 - Mind twisting problems </h1>

<br />
Let us say that debtor D owes $1,000 to his creditor C. Meanwhile, he owns two houses and sells them to buyer B, each for $500.
<br />
<br />
Now C wants his money, and D cannot pay, so C repossesses the first of the houses because real estate always guarantees the loan. B loses one of the houses he bought. Still, he wants to keep the second one, so he comes with $1,000 cash to C and proposes the following: if C wants to consider the first house, the one he just repossessed, as worth $1,000, then all is well; but if not, then this $1,000 should cover both houses, and C gets his money but loses the repossessed house.
<br />
<br />
Rami bar Chama wanted to say that this is precisely our previous rule: there, the orphans could not<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/05/ketubot-91-two-groups-of-children-from.html">&nbsp;artificially inflate the worth of their mother's Ketubah</a>, &nbsp;so here too, the argument of considering the $500 house worth $1,000 does not stand. Without this, the second part of the proposal does not stand either, and the creditor can collect the second house. However, Rava reversed him: in the case of orphans, their suggestion would hurt the other group of children, but in our case, the creditor would always get his $1,000 loan back.
<br />
<br />The following cases are abbreviated with mnemonics ("thousand" - that is our case, "hundred," "mitzvah of Ketubah"...). Such abbreviations, or "signs," contain clues to the mystical meaning of the subjects discussed.
