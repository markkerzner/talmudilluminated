<ul>
<li>completion of six years of service;</li>
<li>the onset of the Jubilee year;</li>
<li>paying his purchase price back to his master minus the cash equivalent of the years already served;</li>
<li>death of his master.</li>
</ul>
In addition to a Hebrew servant's ways, a Hebrew maidservant sold by her father goes free when she reaches twelve years of age and has "signs of physical maturity" (two pubic hairs).<br />
<br />
When a Hebrew servant or maidservant goes free, they receive severance gifts.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;The Farewell By Eugene De Blaas</div>
