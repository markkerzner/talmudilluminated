Although the grandfather can not marry his granddaughter, he can designate her to marry his son, the girl's uncle, which the Torah allows.<br />
<br />
A master, who strikes a Canaanite slave and deprives him of his tooth or eye, must set him free. In contrast, a Hebrew servant receives payment but not freedom in this situation.<br />
<br />
If a servant has a wife or children when he begins his term of servitude, his master may give him a Canaanite slave-woman as a mate.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The-Ill-Matched Lovers by Lucas The Younger Cranach</div>
