<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Through the sequence of Torah passages, we can deduce which transgressions caused him to become poor and sell himself. Still, now that he wants to become free again, he gets leniency.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
He can reduce his remaining years of servitude with a partial payment, but this can result in either a gain or a loss if his price fluctuates.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Leaving the Mosque by Ludwig Deutch</div>
