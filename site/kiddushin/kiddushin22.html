In court, the master bores his ear against the door with an awl as an act of acquisition.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br />A Hebrew servant should be given food and wine better than his master's, and a better bed, because the Torah says, "It is good for him with you."  The master also supports the servant's wife and children that the servant had before his servitude.</div>
