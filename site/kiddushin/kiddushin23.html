<br />
Can we derive from here that a Canaanite slave woman can be acquired by sexual intercourse because she is lifting her master? - No, this is not comparable to regular lifting, where the lifter gets no pleasure. How about anal intercourse where she is not getting pleasure? Who is to say that she is not getting any pleasure? - Disproved!  A slave woman can not be acquired in this way.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: The idle servant by Nicoleas Maes</span></div>
