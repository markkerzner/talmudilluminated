Another way is to provide cash to the slave so that he can use it to free himself.<br />
<br />
Suppose a Canaanite slave was already circumcised and immersed in a Mikveh, and the master knocks out his tooth, takes out his eye, or inflicts damage on any of 22 other extremities. In that case, the slave goes free, and the courts force his master to write a document of emancipation for him.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Two tax collectors by MARINUS VAN REYMERSWAELE</div>
