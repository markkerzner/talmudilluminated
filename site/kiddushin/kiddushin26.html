<br />
Real property may be acquired using money, a document, or a proprietary act such as locking the gate. Movable property may be acquired only by "drawing it near." To protect buyers, the Rabbis abrogated the power of money to acquire so that sellers would guard the sold goods after receiving the money.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;Royal Elephant At The Gateway To The Jami Masjid Mathura by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Rudolf Ernst&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
