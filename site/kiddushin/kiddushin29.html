Some say the father must teach him to swim in the water.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah says, "Anyone who does not teach his son a craft has taught him banditry. Talmud: "Can you really think so? - Rather, as if the father taught him banditry."<div><br /></div><div>Art: Insulted Jewish Boy by Ivan Nikolaevich Kramskoy</div>
