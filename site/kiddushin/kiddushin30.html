He asked, "What is all this rush about?"<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi replied, &nbsp;- is it a small thing to fulfill that which is written in the Shema prayer, "You shall make them known to your children and grandchildren," and next to this, "The day that you stood before Hashem your God at Chorev?" We see from here that teaching Torah to one's grandchild is tantamount to receiving Torah at Sinai.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Moses On Mount Sinai by Jean-Leon Gerome</span></div>
