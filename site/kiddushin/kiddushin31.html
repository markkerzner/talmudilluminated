Rabbi Tarfon came and lauded his own performance of the mitzvah to his colleagues in the study hall. They told him: You have not yet reached half of the honor one can bestow upon his parents. Has your mother ever thrown a bag of money into the sea in your presence, and you did not shame her?<div><br /></div><div>Art: Portret van Rembrandts moeder by Gerrit Dou</div>
