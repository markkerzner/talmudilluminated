<br />
Reverence means that the son may not sit in his father's place; he may not contradict his father in words in his presence - but he may offer challenges to his father's position until a conclusion is reached.<br />
<br />
Honor means that he must give his father food and drink, dress and cover him, bring him in, and take him out.<br />
<br />
The same applies to his mother.<br />
<br />
The son is not required to pay for his parents' needs out of his pocket but merely to expend the effort.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;The Artist's Father, Reading "L'Événement" by Louis-Auguste Cézanne</div>
