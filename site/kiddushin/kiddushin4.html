<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2016/03/kiddushin-3-who-searches-for-whom.html">Earlier, we saw</a>&nbsp;one way to derive that marriage can be effected by giving the bride-to-be a ring or another object of value. However, it was based on taking the extra word "money" from a different place in the Torah and applying it to our context.
<br />
<br />
A more direct way is to take the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=24">When a man takes a woman and has relations with her... if later he does not like her, he can divorce</a>."" This clearly describes the situation of marriage and uses the word "take." The same word "<b>take</b>" is found when Abraham buys a field from Efron and says, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=23#P585">I gave you the money for the field, <b>take</b> it from me.</a>" We thus see that "take" has a meaning of acquiring with money.
<br />
<br />
Now this calls for some logical acrobatics. Look at a Jewish female slave, who cannot be acquired by having relations with her and is acquired only with money; a wife, who is acquired by relations, is undoubtedly acquired with money! Therefore, we don't need the derivation above at all!!
<br />
<br />
No, because a Yebamah case disproves this. Look at Yebamah (one's dead brother's wife), whom the remaining brother has to marry. She is acquired by cohabitation - and nevertheless, she is not acquired with money. So the above logic breaks: someone acquired with relations is nevertheless not acquired with money.
<br />
<br />
However, we can deflect this attack: Yebamah has an inherent weakness in that she is not acquired with a document, whereas a wife <b>is</b> acquired with a document of intent to marry.<br />
<br />
Thus, we saw an attack, a deflection of this attack, and then a deflection of this deflection.  We see at least why the proof based on the word "take" helps.
