He told her, "My heart is weak, and I can not do it. Is there anything to eat?" She said to him: "There is some non-kosher meat." He told her: "What is to be deduced from this? That whoever performs this eats this."&nbsp;</div>

She lit the oven and put the meat inside it. Rabbi Tsadok climbed up and sat inside the oven (he was allowed to sacrifice his life because of his great stature). She said to him: "Had I known that you regard the matter as so severe, I would not have bothered you."</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Marie de Medici by Alessandro Allora</div>
