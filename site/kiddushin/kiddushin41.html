A woman can accept kiddushin and become betrothed personally or through her agent. A man may give his daughter in betrothal when she is a na'arah (under 12) either personally or through his agent. Performing betrothal, as well as any other mitzvah personally, is the preferred way.<br />
<br />
From where in the Torah do we derive the legal concept of agency? From its use of "and he sends her" instead of a more direct, "and he divorces," we learn that both man and woman can appoint an agent.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Young Bride by Konstantin Jegorowitsch Makowski</div>
