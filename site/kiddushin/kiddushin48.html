<h1>Kiddushin 48 - Betrothal with Loan Collection Rights or with Labor</h1>
If a creditor sells a note of indebtedness to his fellow and afterward forgives the debt - it is indeed forgiven. Therefore, if one betroths a woman by giving her a loan document for collection, she may  fear that he will forgive the debt, and thus she does not wholeheartedly commit herself to the betrothal, which is therefore void.<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZVtHHV-Sdo6KPPpjzlUWx4Gl4pMesnswcEhH5n9q0b_6aAi3AO6fc9Uvb-lgYw4dmKCWC8M9fE0FVBdB966EpyVYrz4-IxUg0L34nBM86Z51_OLHvPgTp10eDz2dNY7LpoSxYnNNRLUNE/s1600-h/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272816239931524994" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZVtHHV-Sdo6KPPpjzlUWx4Gl4pMesnswcEhH5n9q0b_6aAi3AO6fc9Uvb-lgYw4dmKCWC8M9fE0FVBdB966EpyVYrz4-IxUg0L34nBM86Z51_OLHvPgTp10eDz2dNY7LpoSxYnNNRLUNE/s200/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 117px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br />

If a woman handed a piece of gold to a craftsman and said to him: "Fashion for me anklets, earrings, or rings, and in return for your labor, I will become betrothed to you," - it is betrothal with a loan, which is invalid.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Still Life Jewellery Casket by Andries Vermeulen</div>
