Unexpressed intentions are not recognized in Jewish law.<br />
<br />
If one betroths a woman and her sister simultaneously, neither is betrothed.<br />
<br />
There were five women, two of whom were sisters, and a man collected a basket of their figs and said, "You are all betrothed to me with this basket" - the sisters were not betrothed.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Three Sisters - A Study in June Sunlight by Edmund Charles Tarbell</span></div>
