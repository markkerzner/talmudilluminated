<br />
Rava: "When a man shall take a wife and cohabit with her..." teaches my rule.<br />
<br />
Abaye: If a man betroths one of two sisters and does not know which, she is betrothed. However, since he does not know which of the two is his wife, he must give both a Get. According to Rava, Kiddushin should not even take effect!<br />
<br />
Rava answers: The man knew whom he betrothed. Thus, the Kiddushin took effect, and then they intermingled.<br />
