The portions allotted to the priest and the owner of the offering are not theirs but rather Divine property, which they are merely permitted to eat.<br />
<br />
But it may be asked, how can a woman come into the Inner Temple courtyard to accept Kiddushin? Her father can accept her Kiddushin, she can appoint an agent, or she can force her way in!<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Offering by Sir Thomas Francis Dicksee&nbsp;</div>
