<br />
But males can also be peace offerings! - We treat them with the stringencies of both; thus, if someone steps forward and voluntarily obligates himself to the monetary value of the lost animal to redeem it, he needs to consecrate the value of both (Rabbi Meir).<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan: But redemption, though effective, is not allowed! - He waits for the animal to get a blemish and be redeemed.<div><br /></div><div>Art: A Goat In A Meadow by Henriette Ronner-Knip</div>
