If the son dies, the father should protest retroactively so that the woman avoids levirate marriage.<br />
<br />
If the father of a girl declared: "I gave my daughter in betrothal, but I do not know to whom," and a man  came and said, ""I am the one," he is believed. If two men came, both of them should give a Get. If they wish, one gives a Get, and the other marries her.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Surprise by Charles Henry Tenre</div>
