If a Jewish woman was married to a Kohen, Levi, or Yisrael, the son is like the father.</div>

<div>
In every case where betrothal takes effect, even though the marriage is prohibited, the offspring follows the blemished party. A woman mamzer married to a Jew or a Jewess married to a mamzer - the child is a mamzer.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In every case where marrying is prohibited to the degree that betrothal does not even take effect, the offspring is a mamzer. Thus, mamzer (literally, "defective seed") is an offspring from any one of the forbidden relations in the Torah, such as a married woman with another man (married or unmarried). Mamzer is forbidden to marry anyone but a convert, and his or her child remains a mamzer.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Jewish Scholars Debating by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Josef Johann Suss</span></div>
