However, Rabbi Eliezer says that the children are still mamzerim.<br />
<br />
Ten genealogical classes went up from Babylonia to Israel: Kohanim, Leviim, Israelim, Chalalim (disqualified Kohanim), converts, freed Canaanite slaves, mamzerim (illegitimate), Netinim (Gibeonites),  Shetukim (whose mother silences him about the father) and Asufim (foundlings, or ones gathered in).<br />
<br />
Kohanim, Levvim, and Yisraelim are permitted to marry each other. Leviim, Israelim, chalalim, converts, and freed slaves are allowed to marry each other.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;A Children's Party by Walter Frederick Osborne</div>
