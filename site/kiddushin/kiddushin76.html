<br />
If in that line he finds a Kohen who served at the Altar, or a member of the Sanhedrin, or a public official, or a charity collector, the investigation stops. The latter two are often involved in quarrels, so any blemish in their genealogy is already known.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Four Breton Women At The Seashore by Charles Cotteto</div>
