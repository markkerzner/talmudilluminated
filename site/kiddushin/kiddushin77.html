He may not perform the Temple service and is not subject to the prohibition against going to the cemetery.<br />
<br />
Women prohibited to a Kohen include a divorcee, a convert, and a woman who cohabited with any man whom she is Biblically forbidden to marry.<br />
<br />
If a male convert marries a female convert, their daughter is allowed to marry a Kohen.<div><br /></div><div>Art: A Conversation Piece by&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Lilly Martin Spencer</span></div>
