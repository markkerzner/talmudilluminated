If the agent's betrothal occurred first, then it is the one that is valid.<br />
<br />
If it is unknown whose betrothal occurred first, she can only marry another man if both give her  a Get. And if they want, one can give her a Get, and the other can marry her.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Alphonse Daudet &amp; his Daughter by Eugene Carriere</div>
