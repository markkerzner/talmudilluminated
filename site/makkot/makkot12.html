Rav Ashi says, "Also the branches," which changes the ruling to say just the opposite: the killer is protected if the tree is inside and he is under the leaves outside.<br />
<br />
If an exiled killer inadvertently killed someone else in that city of refuge where he resides, he is exiled from his neighborhood to a different neighborhood. If a Levite inadvertently killed someone in his home city, he is exiled from his city to another city.<br />
<br />
If a killer was exiled to a city of refuge and the townspeople wanted to honor him, he must tell them, "I am a killer." If they wanted to do it anyway, they were allowed to do so. In the six designated cities of refuge, the killer does not have to pay rent. The other forty-two cities of the Levites also serve as cities of refuge, but the killer who resides there has to pay rent. <br />
<br />
After the killer returns home, Rabbi Meir says that he returns to the position of authority he had occupied previously, but Rabbi Yehudah says that he does not.<br />
