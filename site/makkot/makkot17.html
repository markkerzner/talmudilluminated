<br />
About one who takes a mother bird with her young: Rabbi Yehudah says that he incurs lashes and does not need to send the bird away, but the Sages say that he must send the bird away, and does not incur lashes.<br />
<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Rabbi Shimon derives through logic the prohibition of eating the first fruit mentioned above by comparing it to&nbsp;<a href="" target="_blank">the first tithe</a>.&nbsp;On this, Rava comments, "A woman who is giving birth to him should pray that she should give birth to one like Rabbi Shimon," and proceeds to refute his logic.</span>&nbsp;If so, why the praise? Because Rabbi Shimon knows how to change the order of words to arrive at what the Torah really meant.<br />
