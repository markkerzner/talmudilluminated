<br />
Excision (karet) is also translated as being cut off. One opinion is that it entails both the premature death of the sinner and the loss of his future generations. "Premature death" is death at the ages of fifty through fifty-nine, or even at the ages of sixty through seventy-nine if the death is sudden.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chananya ben Gamliel also said, "If a person who commits a single transgression punishable by being cut off forfeits his life, then if he performs a single mitzvah, how much more so should his life be given to him."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon says that you can derive this better. The verses say, "My laws by which you shall live â€¦ The souls that do incest will be cut off." We see from here that whoever desists and does not do a transgression is given a reward of the one who performs a mitzvah.<br />
