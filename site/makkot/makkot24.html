This can also be seen from the verse "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Moses commanded us the Torah as inheritance</a>". The numerical value of the word Torah is 611, plus the two commandments pronounced by God  Himself make up 613.<br />
<br />
King David established <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/15-1.htm">11 ethical and moral requirements</a> on which to base the 613. <br />
<br />
Isaiah came and <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/33-15.htm">established them on six</a>: "Walk with righteousness, speak with fairness, spurn extortionate profit, avoid suspicions of taking a bribe, seal the ears from hearing of bloodshed, and shut the eyes from seeing evil."<br />
<br />
Michah established them <a href="http://bible.cc/micah/6-8.htm">on three</a>: do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God. <br />
<br />
Habakkuk established them on one: "<a href="http://bible.cc/habakkuk/2-4.htm">The righteous person shall live through his faith</a>".<br />
