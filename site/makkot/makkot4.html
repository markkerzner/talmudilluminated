They pay their victim the amount they intended to make him lose since lashes and repayment come from different places in the Torah - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that whoever pays does not receive lashes since a person cannot be liable for both lashes and monetary payment for the same crime.<br />
<br />
If they said, "We testify about this person that he is liable to forty lashes," and they are found to be false plotting witnesses, they receive eighty lashes - these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages make them liable to only forty.<br />
