In the city, he is safe, but once outside, the avenger of blood - a close relative of the victim - is allowed to kill him. If the killing was a complete accident, the killer is not punishable at all, but if it was gross negligence, then the city of refuge does not protect him.<br />
<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">When one is killed by the "<a href="" target="_blank">wood of the ax</a>", Rabbi Yehudah the Prince understands it as a wood chip, but the Sages say that it means that an axe head slipped off the wooden handle.</span>&nbsp;Therefore, if the victim was killed by the axe-head, Rabbi Yehudah classifies this as gross negligence, when the killer does not go into exile, because it does not help him, but the Sages say that this is precisely the case of the exile. If the death was caused by a woodchip from the tree that is being chopped, then according to Rabbi Yehudah, the killer is exiled, but according to the Sages, he is free from punishment, because the killing was inadvertent.<br />
