At other times, personal altars were forbidden.<p></p><p>During the forty years of travel in the wilderness, the Tabernacle had its Altar, and the sacrifices could be brought only on it and not on personal ones. Then, during the fourteen years of conquering Israel, the Tabernacle was in Gilgal. It was temporary, and although sacrifices continued there, personal altars were also allowed. This situation changed a few times until the Temple was built in Jerusalem. After that, personal altars became forbidden for all times.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Temple, they have placed the Ark that was initially constructed under the direction of Moses. That Ark had no physical dimensions. If one measured from one side of the Ark to the wall of the Holy of Holies, he got ten amot. If he measured from the other side of the Ark to the opposite wall, he also got ten amot. And yet, the distance between the opposing walls of the Holy of Holies was only twenty amot total. That proves that the Ark itself miraculously took no space.</p><p>Art: The Israelites Gathering Manna in the Wilderness by Jacob Willemsz. de Wet</p><div><br /></div>
