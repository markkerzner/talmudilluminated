<h1>Megillah 17 - The order of blessings</h1>

However, obvious things are not stated in the Talmud, and instead, we deal with exceptions. If one reads the Megillah in the wrong order of words, verses, or paragraphs, he has not fulfilled the mitzvah. He should read it from a scroll; reciting by heart is also invalid.<br />
<br />
Other things that must be recited in proper sequence are praises (Hallel) and the central part of the daily prayer, "Amidah," or "Eighteen blessings." The Talmud then discusses the reason for each of the eighteen blessings and why each takes its place in the proper order. After these words, one should not praise God on his own, making them an additional part of the Amidah. Why not? Because he indeed cannot enumerate all the praises, and by saying only some of them, he in fact detracts. By right, this argument should apply to the Amidah itself: how can we start praising God, knowing that we won't do it adequately. For this, one has an excuse since the early Sages established this text and required it to be said daily.<br />
