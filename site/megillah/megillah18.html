In general, this is true for all scriptures. Incidentally, if one were to write a new Megillah on Purim, copying it out of the existing scroll and pronouncing every word, he has fulfilled his obligation of listening to the Megillah reading on Purim.<p></p><p>But, what about the following story: Rabbi Meir went for an urgent matter, to intercalate the year, to Assya. There was no Megillah there, so he wrote it from memory and read it. Rabbi Meir was a different kind of human being. The complete Torah was always in front of his inner eye, so it is as if he wrote it by copying from a scroll. And yet, the Sages forbade writing from memory!? - in case of pressing need, it is allowed.</p><p>But what about tefillin and mezuzah that can be written from memory? This seems to contradict the rule? - Tefillin and mezuzah are known by heart by many. The scribe can write them, provided that he is certain.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Jewish scribe. Jozef Israëls</p>
