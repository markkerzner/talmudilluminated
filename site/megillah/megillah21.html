One can either stand or sit; however, one who reads for the congregation always stands.  By contrast, one who reads the Torah scroll, even in private, should accord the Torah more honor by standing.
<br />
<br />
How do we know this rule about reading the Torah? - Because God said to Moses, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=5#P5079">And you, stand here with Me</a>." In fact, Rabbi Abahu explained it thus: "Were it not that the Torah said it, it would be inappropriate to speak of God in these terms, but it tells us that God, too, was standing while teaching Moses."  From the word "with me," we see that the teacher should be not sitting on the couch while the student is on the ground, but instead, they should be on the same level.  Indeed, earlier generations, from Moses till Rabban Gamliel, were standing while learning Torah. Later a general feebleness  descended into the world, and they began learning while sitting. 
<br />
<br />
Even two people people can read the Megillah for the congregation, but with the Torah it has to be only one. Why? - Since people love the Megillah, they will concentrate and hear every word anyway. 
<br />
<br />
Moses established to read the Torah publicly on Saturday and on Mondays and Thursdays. That way, no three days will pass without one hearing the Torah.
