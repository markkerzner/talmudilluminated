Depending on how much time people have, fewer or more readers are called up. For example, only three readers are called on regular weekdays. On Shabbat, seven people read from the Torah because people are free.<br />
<br />
Initially, the first reader would say the opening blessing, and the last one - the closing one. Later, more people started getting in and out of the synagogue during the reading of the Torah. Then the Sages established that everyone who is called up says both blessings. People who attended only a part of the reading could mistakenly think that the reading of the Torah does not need a blessing before or after.
<br />
<br />
Everyone who reads in the Torah should be given at least three phrases. This presents another problem: since the Torah is written in small sections, visually delineated from the rest, they should read at least three phrases from the beginning of each section. Otherwise, those going in might mistakenly conclude that the previous reader got only two phrases. The same applies to the end of the portion. Therefore, how does one divide the section consisting of five phrases? - He reads three from the beginning, and the next reader repeats the last phrase; thus, both read three phrases. Some say that these precautions only apply to people who are going out. Anyone coming in will surely ask, "How come we started two phrases from the beginning? Did the previous reader only get two phrases?"  - and they will explain to him that the reader started from the section before.
