Why seven? Some say it is because of seven words in the blessing of the Priests, and others - that it corresponds to seven servants of Achashverosh who "saw his face of the king every day."<br />
<br />
In principle, a woman or a minor can be called to read from the Torah, but the Sages said that it should not be done - because it will reflect negatively on the level of knowledge of the male contingent.
<br />
<br />
Certain events require the presence of a minyan, or ten adult Jewish males. For example, communal prayer (with the prayer leader's repetition of the Amidah) cannot be said when there are less than ten people present. Also, the Kohanim don't say their blessing, and the Torah is not read unless there is a minyan present. 
<br />
<br />
But how do we know that the minyan is exactly ten people? - from the word "among." This word is used in describing the congregation of Korach. It is also used with the congregation of the spies who belittled the  Land of Israel. The spies numbered ten. Further, from "I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel," we see that every sanctification needs a congregation, and this congregation is ten.
