Everything except for the awareness of the spirituality that controls the world. Alternatively, the "awareness of spirituality" can be translated as "fear of Heaven." Where is this in the Torah?<p></p><p>"<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=10#P5193" target="_blank">And now, Israel, what does God want of you? Only that you remain in awe of God your Lord</a>." Only remaining in awe is required, but everything else is controlled by God.</p><p>Incidentally, the language implies that having this awe is easy. But we know that it is not! How could Moses say so? That is because, for Moses, it indeed was easy. When they ask something of a person who has it, it seems like something small. But if they ask him for something minor and he does not have it, it looks like something big.</p><p>Art: Poverty and Wealth by William Powell Frith</p><div><br /></div>
