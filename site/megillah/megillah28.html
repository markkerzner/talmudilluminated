One may not eulogize ordinary people there (unless Sages are present, making it a  public eulogy). One may not work there, such as making ropes or nets or spreading fruit on its roof.  One should also not use the synagogue as a shortcut.
<br />
<br />
Why is this? - Because of the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=26#P3553">And I will make your sanctuaries desolate.</a>" Thus, even after desolate, they are still called "your sanctuaries" and retain their rights. If grass sprouts there, one should not uproot it - to inspire grief.
<br />
<br />
Since one cannot enter the synagogue for personal affairs, what is he to do when calling someone out of it? - He should come in and sit down. Then, if he knows certain portions of the Talmud or the Torah, he should recite them. If not, he can ask a child to repeat for him what the child learned today. Thus, he has converted his visit from personal to one for study or for prayer.
