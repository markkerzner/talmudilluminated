However, this is only when there are not enough people to honor the dead. And how many is enough? - Twelve thousand, just as the number of men who went to war with Midian. Others, however, say that it is six hundred thousand: just as the Torah was given to the soul in the presence of six hundred thousand people, it is taken away with six hundred thousand.

Abaye said, "Initially, I learned Torah at home and prayed in the synagogue. Once I understood how God loves the synagogue, I learn and pray there." In another place, we have a conflicting statement, which recommends praying in the place of learning. The synagogue is called "a small Temple." In the future, all synagogues and study halls will be transplanted to Israel.
<br />
<br />
Close to Purim, in Adar, there are four unique Torah portions read in the synagogue. Here they are. Half-shekel collection for the Temple - because of its timing next month. The portion of destroying Amalek - because of its connection to Purim. The red heifer - since it was used to purify the people before the Holidays. "This month will be for you to celebrate Passover" - because by then, it is already Passover time.
