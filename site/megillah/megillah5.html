What is considered a large town? - A place that has "ten idlers." Some say, these are people supported by the community who study in the synagogue at all times, and others - that they don't have to be supported, as long as they are available for prayer.

By contrast, the commemoration of sad events may be pushed back when required but never forward. For example, if Tisha b'Av occurs on Saturday, it is observed following Sunday.<div><br /></div><div><div>Rabbi Yehudah the Prince did three unusual things: he planted a tree on Purim, bathed on the fast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz, and sought to abolish the fast of Tisha b'Av, but the Sages did not agree to this. Each of his actions is analyzed by the Talmud. For example, how could he do work on Purim? Actually, there is nothing wrong with it, but if the community has the custom to abstain from work on this day (as many communities do nowadays), one should follow. About the tree - Rabbi Yehudah planted a particular tree for a joyous occasion, which is permitted.
