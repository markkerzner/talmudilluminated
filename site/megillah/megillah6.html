<h1>Megillah 6 - Should you fight evil?</h1>

<br />
<br />
If someone tells you, "I worked on studying Torah but did not succeed," - do not believe him. Also, don't believe if he says, "I did not work on my studies and nevertheless succeeded." However, if he says, "I worked hard, and I succeeded," - believe him because the two go together. That is only true in understanding, but retaining the knowledge is a gift from Heaven. With regards to business, it is all luck and help from Heaven.
<br />
<br />
If you see an evil person with luck on his side - "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2637.htm">do not contend with this wicked man</a>." However, Rabbi Shimon taught just the opposite, that it is permissible to contend with the wicked in this world, following "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2828.htm">Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but the righteous will fight them</a>." In fact, if someone whispers in your ear the verse of Rabbi Yitzhak about not contending - that is your spirit weakened by your errors, but what it really means - do not try to be like them. 
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it looks like a contradiction!? - Not really! Fight with the wicked in spiritual matters, but allow them to have the things of this world. Or, it could refer even to this world, and "do not fight" applies only when you have luck on his side.
