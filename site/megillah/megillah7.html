It is on this second Adar that Purim must be observed. Some say that it must be on the first Adar. Both derive their opinion from the exact same words in the Megillah, "each and every year." This means "connect the redemption of Purim with Passover and designate the second Adar." Others say it means to do like very year, where Adar follow the previous month of Shvat.

Esther of Purim told the Sages, "Record my holiday in the Megillah." The Sages replied that it would be politically incorrect and lead to resentment from the nations over which the Jews were victorious. She replied, "Anyway, this is already recorded in the chronicles of Persia," and they acceded.
<br />
<br />
Here are the ancient proofs that the Book of Esther was written with the prophetic spirit: it knew what "Haman said in his heart," that "Esther found favor in everybody's eyes," and that "nobody took any booty." However, Shmuel later added a proof: "They confirmed and undertook to read the Megillah every year." Who confirmed? - The Heavenly Court. Rava said he can find faults with all ancient proofs, but not with Shmuel's proof. He applied a proverb, "One sharp pepper is better than a bucketful of melons."
<br />
<br />
One must get so drunk on Purim as not to know the difference between the evil Haman and the righteous Mordechai. Rabbah invited Rav Zeira to a Purim feast, and when they were drunk, he slew Rav Zeira. The next day he prayed for mercy, and Rav Zeira came back to life. Next year, though, Rav Zeira declined the invitation, saying, "A miracle does not occur every time."
