For other laws - such as reading the four special Torah portions reminding of important events - they are equal. From here on, we have a series of "there is no difference" statements. 
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between the laws of Shabbat and Holidays, except that one is allowed to cook for people's consumption on Holidays.
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur, except that for doing work on Shabbat, one may theoretically be executed, and for the same on Yom Kippur - there is only "being cut off from one's people."
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between a vow prohibiting one all benefit from the other person and a vow prohibiting food benefits - because many things lead to food - except for the permission to pass through his property. 
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between vowing to bring a sacrifice and designating a specific animal, except that when he vows and then buys an animal, and it is lost or dies, he has to buy another one.
<br />
<br />
There is no difference between a zav (see <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">here</a>) who had two emissions and one who had three, but that the latter needs to bring a sacrifice.
<br />
<br />
A metzora (spiritual leper) may be quarantined and declared a definite metzora. There is no difference between the two states, except that the latter also needs to let his hair grow and tear his garments as a sign of grief.
