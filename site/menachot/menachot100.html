Four more priest preceded them to remove the bread. The ones with the new bread stood in the north, which is more holy, and as the other ones pulled the bread from the table, the new bread was placed on it, hand-breadth by hand-breadth, to fulfill the obligation of the bread being "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/25-30.htm">before Me, continuously</a>."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose says that even if the priests removed the bread in the morning, and the other priests would put it on in the evening, this too is called "continuously." They exited the Sanctuary, burned the frankincense, and apportioned the bread among the priest, who would eat it.<br />
<br />
From the words of Rabbi Yose we learn that if one learns a little Torah in the morning and a little in the evening, he fulfills "<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/1-8.htm">the Torah shall not depart from your mouth</a>," and even if he just reads the "Sh'ma," but we don't tell this to the unlearned. Rava said, "It is a mitzvah to tell it to them."<br />
<br />
What could be the five reasons why it is a mitzvah to tell it to them? - Your suggestions are welcome.<br />
