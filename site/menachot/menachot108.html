Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says that he brings a turtledove or a pigeon. They do not argue in principle, but in the place where one lived lambs were cheaper, and where Rabbi Elazar lived, birds were less expensive.<br />
<br />
One who says, "I specified to bring a peace or a thanksgiving offering but do not recall which," brings a bull and a cow, a male calf and a female calf, a ram and a ewe, a he-goat and a she-goat, a male kid and  a female kid, and a male lamb and a female lamb.<br />
<br />
If one promised a specific ox as a burned offering and the ox became blemished, his obligation disappears. Unlike the previous cases, he promised a specific animal and not a sacrifice in general, and once this animal cannot be brought as a sacrifice, he is free from his obligation. He still needs to redeem the ox, and the money then acquires holiness and has to be used for a burned offering, but he can buy greater or smaller animals with it.<br />
