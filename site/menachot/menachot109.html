<h1>Menachot 109 - The temple of Chonyo</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H7TTfGZILog/Tgf6yb13T0I/AAAAAAAAFJY/hGDexmlj_XU/s1600/Josef+von+Brandt+-+The+Runaway+Cart.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="196" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H7TTfGZILog/Tgf6yb13T0I/AAAAAAAAFJY/hGDexmlj_XU/s320/Josef+von+Brandt+-+The+Runaway+Cart.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one had two lambs and said, "one of my lambs will be consecrated," the larger of them is consecrated, because we assume that people consecrate generously.<br />
<br />
In one promised a sacrifice and brought it in the temple of Chonyo, he has not fulfilled his obligation, but instead transgressed a prohibition of offering sacrifices outside the Temple. Rabbi Shimon says, "His consecration is altogether meaningless."<br />
<br />
Any kohen who served in the temple of Chonyo is treated as blemished: he may never serve in the Temple, but he may claim a share of the offerings to eat.<br />
<br />
What is the story of the temple of Chonyo? When the Righteous High Priest Shimon died after eighty years of service, he appointed his son Chonyo as his successor. Chonyo's brother Shimi plotted to remove him: he tricked him to serve in his wife's clothes and told the priests that Chonyo did this out of love for his wife. Chonyo ran away and built his own temple. The Sages did not touch Shimi, to prevent him from acting even worse in pursuit of honor. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the story was the opposite: Chonyo plotted against Shimi, was discovered, and ran away.<br />
