The minimum in this case would be two blocks, and their dimensions are one by one cubit. Since it is a sacrifice, it requires two more blocks of wood to burn it, like any other sacrifice. <br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah derives this opinion from the words "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-1.htm">flour offering sacrifice</a>." Since flour offering is already a sacrifice, this means some other offering, namely wood. Moreover, just like flour, wood offering needs to be salted. And, just like flour, one needs to take off a handful. For this, one needs to chip away at it, until a handful is collected.<br />
<br />
The salt was stored in the Temple in three places: in the chamber of salt - for the hides, on the ramp - for the limbs, and at the top of the Altar - because there they would salt the handful of flour, its frankincense, and the incense.  <br />
