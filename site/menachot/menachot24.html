The rule is that a vessel combines the parts, but is it true even for impurity? Rav Kahana gave an answer from the wording of the rule, which does not state that it joins the halves, but only that it combines. This means that they are not joined for impurity.<br />
<br />
If a zav (one with strong impurity) was lying on a sheet, the sheet acquired his strong impurity. If the owner then made this sheet into a curtain, on which no one can lie, then the previous strong impurity leaves, but since the sheet touches itself (every thread in it touches another thread), then it has the lighter impurity of being touched by a zav. However, Rabbi Yose asked, “Which zav touched it?” - Rabbi Yose means that a thread touching another thread means nothing, because this is hidden impurity, which does not count. <br />
