The same is true if the service has been performed by a mourner, by an impure person even if he went to the mikvah and will be pure at night, by a kohen who lacks some of the priestly garments, by one who has not washed his hands and a feet, who is uncircumcised, is sitting, or is standing on his colleague's feet.<br />
<br />
If one did the service with his left hand, it is invalid, but Ben Beteira says that he can re-do it with his right hand.<br />
<br />
If, while he was taking a handful, a pebble, a grain of salt, or a particle of frankincense came up in his hand, making the handful incomplete, the service is invalid. The rule is: if he took more than a handful or less than a handful, the offering is invalid. For example, if flour was showing between his fingers (too much) or if he took it with his forefingers (too little), the offering is invalid.<br />
