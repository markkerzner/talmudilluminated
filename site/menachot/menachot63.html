The latter was a griddle with only a slight lip around it. Rabbi Yose HaGlili says that the difference between the deep and flat offering is that the first one has a cover, but Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel says that the cover has nothing to do with it, but that the offering prepared in a deep pan is soft and it quivers, whereas the one prepared in a shallow pan is thin and hard.<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai are not certain if "deep" refers to the pan or to the offering, so according to them one who promises a deep-pan offering (not an offering in a deep pan) has to wait until Elijah the Prophet comes and explains how to do it. <br />
<br />
The oven-baked flour offering can be either loaves baked with oil or wafers baked without oil and smeared with oil after baking. It was baked in a stove called "tanur," which had a trapezoidal shape with an opening at the top. Bread was baked by affixing it to the walls of the oven.<br />
