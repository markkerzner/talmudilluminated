Rabbi Shimon says that the handful is taken, but both the handful and the remains are burned on the Altar. Rabbi Elazar (his son) says that the remains are spread over the site of ashes.<br />
<br />
The following flour offerings are, by contrast, completely given to the kohanim: the two loaves of Shavuot and the Bread of Vision, and in this the right of the kohanim is stronger than the right of the Altar.<br />
