One may mix together the libations of bulls with the libations of rams, because they contain the same proportion of oil, that is, two logs (one cup) of oil per issaron (five pounds) of flour. <br />
<br />
The libations of lambs may be mixed with the libations of other lambs. These contain three logs (one-and-a-half cup) of oil per issaron of flour. One can even mix the libations of private individual's lamb with the libations of a communal lamb, and even those of today with those of tomorrow - as long as they did not get sanctified in a vessel.<br />
<br />
If one made the libations of bulls and accidentally mixed with the libations of lambs, they are valid, even though of different oil consistency - because they do not mix further. But if one mixed them before the ingredients were combined, the result is invalid.<br />
