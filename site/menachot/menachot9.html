<h1>Menachot 9 - If Enemies Laid Siege to the Courtyard</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u7Zsg4rKZBs/TYWbGJ-y7FI/AAAAAAAAEwE/s4E69eiIJng/s1600/Camille+Pissarro+-+The+Maidservant.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-u7Zsg4rKZBs/TYWbGJ-y7FI/AAAAAAAAEwE/s4E69eiIJng/s320/Camille+Pissarro+-+The+Maidservant.jpg" width="247" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If enemies have surrounded the Courtyard of the Temple and are shooting into it, so that the Kohanim cannot eat sacrifices in the Courtyard, they are allowed to enter the Temple Hall and to continue eating the meat of the most holy offerings, as well as cooked flour-offerings, inside. How do we know that? The Torah says "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/18-10.htm">in the most holy you shall eat it</a>" Most holy here means the Sanctuary, of the Temple Hall.<br />
<br />
But why would we need a verse to prove it? If offerings do not get disqualified in the Courtyard, which is subsidiary to the Hall, then of course they do not get disqualified in the Hall itself!? - That is true, they do not get disqualified, but for eating them we need a special permission. This is similar to a servant doing his work before his master, but to eat in the presence of his master - for that the servant needs a special permission. Therefore the verse teaches us that it is allowed.<br />
