<h1>Menachot 95 - Where Was the Bread of Vision Baked?</h1>

Since the  the bread was moved from its place, is this  the same as leaving the curtains, or does the Tabernacle retain its status to protect the bread from invalidation?  Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi argue about this, but we do not know who held what view. Based on the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/2-17.htm">as they encamp so shall they journey</a>," the bread in travel becomes invalid just as in the encampment, but based on "<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/4-7.htm">and the constant bread shall remain upon the table</a>," the bread remains valid.<br />
<br />
The bread of vision was kneaded outside the Temple - because vessels did not sanctify the flour - and baked inside the Temple before Shabbat. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: it was kneaded and baked inside the Temple, on Shabbat, to protect the bread from staying overnight. Rabbi Shimon maintains that both ways are valid. Their proofs are not based on the <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/21-6.htm">story of King David and the priestly bread</a> - for David had a case of boulimia - extreme hunger - but on tradition.<br />
