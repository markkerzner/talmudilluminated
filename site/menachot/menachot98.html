There they kept two measuring sticks used for Temple work. <br />
<br />
The original measure of length called "amah" or "arm" in English, established by Moses, was six hand-breadths. Since each hand-breadth equals four finger-breadths (actually, thumb-breadths), the amah of Moses was thus 24 finger-breadths. The two Temple measures were slightly longer, one measuring 24.5 finger-breadths, and the other - 25 finger-breadths. When craftsmen took orders for Temple work, they quoted the price according to the amah of Moses, but they delivered their results according to the amah of the Temple, that is, slightly more - to avoid accidental misappropriation of the Temple property. The shorter of the two Temple measure, the 24.5 finger-breadths, was used for golden and silver utensils, and the longer one, the 25 finger-breadths - for construction work.<br />
<br />
King Solomon made ten tables in the Temple, with the table of Moses in the center of them. He also made ten menorahs, with the menorah of Moses in the center.<br />
