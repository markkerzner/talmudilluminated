However, they put bread only on the one table that Moses had made, and lighted only one menorah. Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua says that they used all the tables, since it says "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/4-19.htm">The tables with the bread upon them</a>." How does the other teacher explain the plural "tables?" He says that they always used three tables anyway: the breads were prepared on a silver table, then they were placed in the Holy of Holies on a golden table, and after they were removed from there, they were put on a third table, also of gold.<br />
<br />
Why was the third table made of gold? Because of the rule, "we raise in holiness but never bring down." What is the source for this rule? When <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/40-18.htm">Moses assembled the Tabernacle</a>, he did it all by himself. Once the work was started by him, anyone else doing it would be considered a descent. But this only proves that we do not bring down, how do we know to elevate? Because the <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/10-2.htm">first set of Tablets which was broken was nevertheless also put in the Ark</a>.<br />
