For example, if he is afraid that his fruit may be stolen, he can bring them into his house. He should, however, do it privately, away from the public eye. 
<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef had some large, heavy beams, which could not be left outdoors, and he brought them in during the day. Abaya asked him, "But we learned 'do it privately'!?" Rav Yosef answered: "This is considered private since at night I would have to hire more people and torches, so it would be even more public."
<br />
<br />
Also, one should not plan the work for the holiday weekdays, using this permission as a loophole. What happens if he planned to do it on holiday weekdays but died - is his son also penalized and prohibited from doing the work? The Talmud tries to find the answer by comparing this to other cases when a father did something wrong and died, and the son could not use the results of the father's transgression. However, these laws do not have the same strength, and the son would be allowed to finish the work, even if his father planned it for holiday weekdays and died.<br />
<br />
One should not buy homes or animals unless they are for the needs of the Holiday. However, if there is a sale, and if he misses that, he will have to pay more later, he is allowed to avail himself of the opportunity.
