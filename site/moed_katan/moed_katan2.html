The last day is also a Yom Tov. The five intermediate days are called "holiday weekdays" between the first and the last Yom Tov. On these days, work is permitted, but it is limited - thus adding to the enjoyment of the holidays.<br />
<br />
What are these limitations, and what kind of work should not be done on holiday weekdays? In general, only work that leads to losses if not performed - only such work is allowed. Moreover, even when saving his crop from ruin, the farmer cannot work too much.<br />
<br />
Take, for example, a field. If this field is usually irrigated by rain, one should not water it during the weekdays. The crop in this field can survive without his additional water, so watering it would only lead to further growth, and that is not reason enough to work. On the other hand, if his field is high up in the mountains, it depends on watering. Without this, his crop would be ruined. Then the farmer is allowed to water it.<br />
<br />
Even so, one cannot work too hard. One can use a spring and divert its water to the field. However, he cannot draw water from a well because this requires much more exertion.<br />
<br />
The two additional limitations are the view of Rabbi Yehudah. There are, however, other views, which take away both of the "preventing loss" and "not working too much" limitations for the holiday weekdays - and that is the view of Rabbi Meir.<br />
