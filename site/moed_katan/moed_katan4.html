For instance, the farmer cannot draw water for his field, neither from water wells nor from pools of rainwater.
<br />
<br />
We understand that drawing water from a well using a pail requires exertion. However, what's the problem with the pool of rainwater? It should be easy to trace a path for the water with one's foot and let it flow from the reservoir into the field. - The Sages simply prohibited both together so that people would not make the wrong deduction. Others say the pool of rainwater may eventually dry out and require a pail. They argue about whether water may or may not dry out.
<br />
<br />
There is one exception for the above rules: one may bring up (water with a pail) for the vegetables, to eat them on the Holidays. Ravina and Rabbah were traveling along the road on a particular holiday weekday, and they saw a man who was drawing water with a pail and watering his vegetable patch. Rabbah said to Ravina, "Let's excommunicate him for violating the law!" Ravina answered, "but we may draw up for vegetables in order to eat them." Rabbah asked, "Is that how you understand 'bring up'? No! - This means, thinning out the vegetable by 'bringing up' the extra ones, which don't let the others to grow." Ravina showed him an example where "bringing up" meant bringing up water, and Rabbah said, "I agree with your proof and retract my opinion."
