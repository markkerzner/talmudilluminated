Since talking about Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel says that "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3404.htm">His hair has grown like the feathers of an eagle</a>" the person does a mental proximity search and, finding the two words "hair" and "eagle" (bird) close, he means the hair of a nazir  when he refers to birds - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that he is not a nazir because people do not do such proximity searches in their heads.
<br />
<br />
This explanation is hard to accept, though - not everybody is so knowledgeable. It could be that nobody does such searches. Instead, the man meant those birds that a nazir needs to bring if he becomes ritually impure - and this explains why Rabbi Meir says that he becomes a nazir. But perhaps he meant to pay for the bird sacrifice for someone else but not become a nazir himself? - We have to say that a nazir was passing before him.
<br />
<br />
The Sages, however, consider all these explanations of the point of view of Rabbi Meir as forced and say that the man does not become a nazir by promising a bird sacrifice.
