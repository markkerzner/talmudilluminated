The first said, "I am a nazir if this is John." The second one said, "I am nazir if this is not John." The third one said to the first two - "I am a nazir if one of you is now a nazir." The fourth one said, "I am a nazir if one of you two is not a nazir." The fifth one said, "I am a nazir if both of you are nazirim." And the sixth said - talking to all five - "I am a nazir that you are all nazirim." What is their status?
<br />
<br />
1) Beit Shammai says that they are all nazirim. They all wanted to become nazirim and added their qualifications as a by-the-way, but not essential to their vow.
<br />
<br />
2) Beit Hillel said that only those with fulfilled conditions become nazirim. This is the most straightforward logic.
<br />
<br />
3) Rabbi Tarfon says that nobody is a nazir. A conditional vow does not make a nazir; it must be clear and direct.
<br />
<br />
If now the person in question suddenly turned back, and they never found out who he was, what is their status then?
<br />
<br />
4) Rabbi Yehudah says that no one becomes a nazir because a person never accepts to be a nazir out of doubt.
<br />
<br />
5) Rabbi Shimon says that he has a real problem: he is a nazir out of doubt, but cannot get out of this because only a real nazir is allowed to shave his head, so if he is not a nazir, he cannot complete his vow. Therefore, he should declare: "If I am a real nazir - well and good, but if not, I am now become one out of my free will."<br />
