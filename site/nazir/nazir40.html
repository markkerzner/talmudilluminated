However, the words "razor" or really "no razor" is already sufficient for us to know the law. Then why are the words "will not pass over his head" written at all? - to include any other way of hair removal, such as pincers or depilatory, and to make it prohibited for nazir to remove his hair in any way. 
<br />
<br />
But now the word "razor" becomes extra: if, in the end, the Torah is going to prohibit all kinds of hair removal, then why mention "razor?" Now, this teaches an additional law: that when the nazir concludes his term and shaves his head, that shaving must be done only with a razor. If he uses any other instrument, the shaving does not count; he has to re-do the last thirty days of a nazir and shave again, this time correctly. 
<br />
<br />
There are, in general, three categories of people who must shave all their hair: a nazir, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath">metzora</a> (spiritual leper), and all Levites on the day of their first inauguration  for Temple service. The Talmud tries to derive the laws of one of these categories from the others.
