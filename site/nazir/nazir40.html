<h1>Nazir 40 - Real shaving is done with a razor</h1>

However, the words "razor," or really "no razor" are already sufficient for us to know the law. Then why are the words "will not pass over his head" written at all? - to include any other way of hair removal, such as pincers or depilatory, and to make it prohibited to the nazir to remove his hair in any way. 
<br />
<br />
But now the word "razor" becomes extra: if in the end the Torah is going to prohibit all kinds of hair removal, then why mention "razor?" Now this teaches an additional law: that when the nazir concludes his term, and shaves is head, that shaving must be done only with a razor. If he uses any other instrument, the shaving does no count, he has to re-do the last thirty days of a nazir, and shave again, this time correctly. 
<br />
<br />
There are in general three categories of people who must shave all their hair: a nazir, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath">metzora</a> (spiritual leper), and all Levites on the day of their first inauguration  for Temple service. The Talmud tries to derive the laws of one of these categories from the others.
