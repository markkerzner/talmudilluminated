If a nazir comes in touch with a dead body, he loses his previous days, has to shave, must bring sacrifices, and then restart. How much of a dead body? One example is a skull and spine - just bones, even if they have no meat.
<br />
<br />This rule had two versions; one read "skull and spine," but the other read "skull or spine." According to the second one, a skull or a spine is enough for a nazir to lose his days and shave. Which one is right?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries to resolve this in many ways. For example, since there are six questions related to nazir where Rabbi Akiva initially held a more stringent position but eventually conceded to the Sages, if his position was more stringent here, too, and read "skull or spine," - then the total count would be seven, not six. However, Rabbi Shimon says there was another rule about a "quarter-measurement of blood from two different deads," which Rabbi Akiva never conceded. This changes the count and ruins our proof.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, Rabbi Shimon emphasized his points: "While Rabbi Akiva was alive, he never changed his mind on this question, and whether he retracted after death - I don't know about that." Unfortunately, there were more refined ways of putting it. Rabbi Shimon felt remorse and fasted to atone for it until his teeth darkened.
