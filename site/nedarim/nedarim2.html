He can use the words, "I am making a vow (neder)," but he can also say, "This is prohibited to me as  a sacrifice ("korban"). He can use a synonym, such as "konam" instead of a "korban." Finally, he can say an incomplete vow, such as "I am separated from you" or "I am distanced from you," and as a result, he will not be able to derive any benefit from his fellow who was the subject of his vow.

<br />
The same rule applies to oaths as well. But how is an oath different from a vow? - Vow is usually directed at an object (bread), but an oath talks about the person's action (eating this bread).
<br />
<br />
For the following ten pages, we will discuss incomplete vows, and now the Talmud discusses why the teacher chose to discuss incomplete vows, which were mentioned last, and not synonyms, which were mentioned first. Examples of word sequences are brought from all areas of law, such as adornments that women can wear on Shabbat, flour sacrifices in the Temple, and inheritance laws.
