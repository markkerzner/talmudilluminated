He gave the following advice: one who wants to press his friend to eat with him should say, "Any vows that I will make will be void," and then tell his friend, "I vow that you will eat with me."
<br />
<br />
But this could not be: once his friend hears the annulment, he will pay no attention to his vow and surely won't eat with him!
<br />
<br />
Instead, Rabbi Elazar was hiding something. This is what he meant: if one uses a vow to press his friend to eat with him, then this is just a vow to create motivation, which is automatically invalid. On a different theme, if one wants his vows for the coming year to be ineffective, he should stand up at the beginning of the year, on Rosh Hashana, and say thus: "All vows (Kol Nidre) that I will vow throughout the year should be void!" Then, when he, later on makes a vow, it is void, provided that he remembers his initial stipulation.
<br />
<br />
But no, just the opposite; if he remembers, why is he making a vow now? - it is to overturn it! Instead, he should NOT remember, and his vow is null and void, according to his "Kol Nidre" declaration.
