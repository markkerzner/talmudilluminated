<h1>Nedarim 3 - Do not delay</h1>

The answer is that the teacher loves complicated and non-obvious derivations and prefers to explain them first.
<br />
<br />
Just as one can vow not to eat, drink, or use an object, one can vow to become a Nazir so that he won't drink wine, cut his hair or go to a cemetery. The laws of vows and of Nazir are parallel: one should not violate his vow, nor should he delay it. 
<br />
<br />
However, how can one violate a "do not delay" to become a Nazir? All the time that he is not a Nazir, he is not, and there is no requirement to become one. And once he vows to be a Nazir, he is, and he is not delaying anything.
<br />
<br />
This situation can be found when he says, "I will be a Nazir before I die." Since he does not know when he will die, he should become a Nazir immediately because he might break his vow the next moment. He violates the "do not delay" prohibition when he does not become a Nazir. This is similar to the one who says to his wife, "Here is your divorce (Get) an instant before I die." Suppose, for example, she is married to a Kohen. In that case, she is immediately prohibited from eating Kohen's portion (terumah) since he may die the next moment, and it would come out that she ate terumah illegally. <br />
