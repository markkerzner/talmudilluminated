<br />
<br />
Basically, why should Torah be taught for free? Moses said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=4#P5016">Look, I taught you the Torah, for free, just as God commanded me</a>," - and you should also teach for free. Then if so, why is teaching Torah considered a benefit, which one should not confer on his fellow if he vowed against him? - We mean teaching the written Torah, and one takes money for teaching the melody, not the words. Alternatively, the art of reading the written Torah is usually taught to small children, and one receives money for being their babysitter rather than a teacher. However, moral lessons are for adults, and one cannot take the reward.
<br />
<br />
The rule says one can teach the fellow's sons and daughters. This rule is the source for the view that Torah should be taught to women as well as men.<br />
