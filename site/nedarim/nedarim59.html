In this last case, all that grows from that fruit was forbidden, which must prove that new growth does not nullify the old one.
<br />
<br />
However, even this proof does not stand. Vows are different because they are inherently wrong, and no common laws can be derived from them. Why are vows wrong? - Just like Rabbi Nathan said - one who makes a vow is like one who builds a private altar for sacrifices (which is now forbidden, there should be only one Altar in Jerusalem), and one who fulfilled his vow is as if he brought a sacrifice on this altar.
<br />
<br />
To explain, one who builds a private altar probably thinks he does a mitzvah by worshiping in this manner. And one who makes a vow also feels that he did a great thing by creating another prohibition for himself. In truth, the argument should be just the opposite: there are enough prohibitions already, and one should not make more.
