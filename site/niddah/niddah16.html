<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai say that she must use two clean examination clothes for each and every act of cohabitation, or she must cohabit by the light of a lamp. That means, she must wipe herself before and after the act, and set the cloth aside for later examination. If she only has one cloth, she must inspect it by lamplight each time. Actually, one should not cohabit by lamplight, but only use it for the inspection. Beit Hillel, on the other hand, say that two examination clothes suffice her through the entire night.
<br />
<br />
Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: "According to your view, it is possible that the blood is covered by later wiping." Beit Hillel answered, "Even according to you, it might still be diluted with semen and dissipate!" Beit Shammai replied, "One-time dilution is not comparable to two-times dilution."
