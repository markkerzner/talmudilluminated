If she aborts something resembling domesticated animal, wild animal, or fowl, then Rabbi Meir says that she observes the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-21-miscarriage.html">waiting periods as if she gave birth to a human</a>, but the Sages say that only a human-like form considered birth for the purposes of ritual purity.
<br />
<br />
We can understand the Sages, but how does Rabbi Meir arrive at his point of view, and why does he not include the likeness of a fish? Some say, this is because the term "created" was used in conjunction with human and with animals. But "created" is also used in "And God created large sea creatures!?" - This is a difficulty that the Talmud explains by analyzing the use of the extra word, "created" in different context. Other say, this is because animal eyes resemble those of humans.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yirmiyah asked Rabbi Zeira, "According to Rabbi Meir, who considers the shape of an animal like a human in some way, what if this animal is a female, and its father accepted a marriage proposal money from a man for it - can that man marry her sister?" 
<br />
<br />
Rav Adda bar Ahava asked Abaye, "What if - the other way around - an animal gives birth to someone resembling human, would Rabbi Meir say it is a human?" What difference does it make? - In the case where the mother animal was slaughtered before giving birth, would her ritual slaughter allow to eat this creature, like it does for normal animals?
