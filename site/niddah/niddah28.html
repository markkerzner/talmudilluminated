Earlier we saw <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-26-afterbirth-in-house.html">the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that an afterbirth containing a dissolved fetus is ritually pure</a>. In explaining it, Resh Lakish said, "It is similar to a corpse whose shape was obliterated, which is pure." Rabbi Yochanan told him, "You seem to derive your opinion from the rule that a corpse that kept its shape is impure. But perhaps its ashes are even more impure!" Incidentally, how can a corpse keep its shape after cremation?  Abaye said, "In a mold of fireproof leather." Rava said, "In a mold of a marble slab." Ravina said, "If it was completely charred but not reduced to ashes."

<br />
If a woman aborts either a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-14-doubtful-gender-takes.html">tumtum (indeterminate gender)</a> or an androgyne, she needs to observe the periods of birth impurity followed by a special period of purity for both a male and a female child. However, if she aborted twins, either a tumtum and a female, or an androgyne and a female, she only observes the purity periods for a female, because these are twice as long and overlap those of a male child.
<br />
<br />
If the fetus comes out dismembered or in a breach position, it is considered born when the majority of it appears. However, if it comes out in the usual manner, it is not considered born until most of its head comes out of the womb - that is, its forehead.
