However, our examples were all about Kiddush. What about regular meals?<p></p><p>If people started eating in one house and then moved to another one, all agree that one needs to say another blessing. But if they move from one room to another, they do not need to say another blessing in the next room.</p><p>This rule is simple enough; the problem is that some people have a different reading of their text, and it says "when they move from one corner to another." This reading assumes that you still see your previous table. If you move from a room to another room, you do say a new blessing in the next room. Complicated as this discussion is, it is actually the accepted law, and one says a new blessing.</p><p>However, there is an exception to this ruling as well: it depends on what food they eat and what blessing follows. These rules, with the accompanying discussions, will bear relevance to eating at the Seder.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;A Breakfast Table by John Singer Sargent&nbsp;</p>
