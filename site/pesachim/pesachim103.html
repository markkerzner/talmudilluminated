Other blessings are recited together with Havdalah, and there are also many opinions on their order. The opinion of Rava prevails here, and it is abbreviated as YKNH"Z, which stands for blessings on the wine, Kiddush, light (which was not lit on Shabbat), Havdalah, and <i>Shehecheyanu,</i>&nbsp;"Who allowed us to live to this season."<div><br /></div><div>Three people were drinking wine at a meal: Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi. They differed in saying blessings over wine, but each one explained his behavior. Ameimar&nbsp;said a blessing in each cup. He would decide to stop drinking after each cup but would every time change his mind. So, a new blessing was in order. Mar Zutra said the blessing on the first cup and on the last cup, which would come after the Grace after Meal. The new wine that came after the Grace, according to Mar Zutra, required a new blessing. Rav Ashi only said the blessing on the first cup. All wine after that was a continuation of drinking.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: The Drinkers by Vincent van Gogh</div>
