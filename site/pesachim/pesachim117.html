There are many opinions about who composed those verses and when: David, Moses, the Sages, the Jews at the Red Sea, etc. There are also ten gradations of praise found there, each introduced with a special word. For example, when the psalms start with "By David, a song," - this means that first God's presence rested on David, and then he recited the song. On the other hand, when it starts with "A song by David," - he recited the song, and afterward, the Divine presence rested on him.
<br />
<br />
This tells us an important principle: the Divine presence does not rest on lazy or sad or frivolous, but rather on the one who experiences a serious joy. This is illustrated in Elisha's story, who asked for music, and when a musician played, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b03.htm">God's hand rested on Elisha</a>."
