From where does the Talmud derive this idea?<br />
<br />
In describing which animals went into Noah's Ark, the Torah says, "and of animals that are not pureâ€¦" It could have said, "that are impure," but it wanted to avoid calling them thus, and spent extra eight letters to use a lengthier but pure language.
<br />
<br />
However, in teaching, one must also express himself in the most concise and clear language possible to make it easier for students to remember. What is the conclusion then? As thus: if the two ways, the clean and the not clean, are equal in length, one should use the clean language. But if the clean language is longer, one should use the precise though unpleasant language. Why then did the Torah deviate from the rule and use a longer "animals that are not pure?" - to teach the value of refined speech.<br />
<br />
Once two students were studying with Rav. One said, "this study made us tired as pigs," and the other - "this study made us tired as young goats," and Rav never spoke with the first one again.
