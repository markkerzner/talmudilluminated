Why just these? - Because the Torah said, "With the Passover offering, you don't eat any leavenâ€¦ for seven days you will eat matzah." Thus, only things that can become leaven can serve for matzah for the Passover Seder. What is excluded? For example, rice.<br />
<br />
Can you revert this rule and say that only things that can be made into Seder matzah are prohibited as hametz? Not quite, and here is why. Rav Pappa and Rav Huna were sitting in front of Rav Idi, who was dozing off. They said between themselves, "Why does Resh Lakish say that if one makes a dough with fruit juice and it leavens, one still has not violated Passover? - It must be because this matzah is too rich, and one needs to remember affliction and eat matzah of poverty. But, on the other hand, if one dissolves flour in water and it leavens, he is liable, even though it is not fit as matzah for the Seder!?" At this, Rav Idi woke up and said, "Kids! Resh Lakish's reason is different: dough made with fruit juice does not leaven!"
<br />
<br />
One fulfills his obligation to eat matzah even if it was made from flour that has not been fully tithed or has minor defects in the tithing procedure, but not major ones.
