Furthermore, this tithe cannot be given to a bereaved, but rather it is reserved for joyful occasions. Can one make matzah out of it? - No, because matzah is called "the bread of affliction" - these are the words of Rabbi Yosi HaGlili. However, Rabbi Akiva disagrees: the Torah has mentioned the word "matzah" many times, to indicate that even the second tithe flour can be used. But matzah is called "bread of affliction!?" - fine, just don't make it with wine, oil, or honey. Still, "bread of affliction," "lechem oni" does hint at bereavement? - No, it does not, rather it means "bread of answer" - since over matzah we answer many questions.

<br />
Fruit and grain that ripens first is called "first fruit" and is brought to Jerusalem and is eaten there by the priests. Can the priests make matzah out of that? - No, since the Torah said, "You will eat matzah in all your dwellings," that is, matzah must be fit to be eaten everywhere, and the first fruit flour is fit to be eaten only in Jerusalem.
