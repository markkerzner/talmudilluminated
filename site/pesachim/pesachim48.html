On <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/09/pesachim-47-since.html">the previous page</a>, we discussed baking bread (unleavened, of course) close to the end of a holiday, when one is full and cannot eat what he will bake. However, <i>since</i> should the guests chance, they will come and eat his bread, he is not liable for using the Holiday to prepare for a weekday. The principle of "<i>since</i>" had a champion in Rabbah, but Rav Chisda did not accept this way of reasoning.
<br />
<br />
Earlier, however, we saw a similar argument about baking matzah on Passover's holiday, when the dough was ritually impure. Rabbi Eliezer allowed it. Can we say that he too agrees with the principle of <i>since</i>, and he allowed it because of this: <i>since</i> one could bake each loaf separately, it was OK for him to bake all of them together and then designate one matzah as the kohen's portion? 
<br />
<br />
If the Talmud can, it will try to combine the disagreements and find the same root cause. However, this does not work here. Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer used the <i>since</i> principle for matzah baking only<i>&nbsp;</i>because each individual loaf is at least suited for him. However, in the case of guests, where he himself is full and cannot eat the bread, the principle of <i>since</i> would not t apply.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Rabbi Yehoshua may reverse his position. Maybe he only opposes the <i>since</i> principle in the case of matzah baking, where the impure challah portion was not fit for anyone. However, in the case of baking at the end of a holiday, where the food he is preparing would at least be good for the guests - there, Rabbi Yehoshua could agree to the principle of <i>since</i>.&nbsp;<br />
