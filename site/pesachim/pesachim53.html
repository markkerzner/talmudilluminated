One may sell an ox or a horse just before Shabbat, the buyer may then ask to demonstrate the animal's prowess, and the Jew would spur it on with his voice, thus causing the animal to work on Shabbat.  (This prohibition is not in force today).
<br />
<br />
Some communities adopted a prohibition not to sell small livestock - so that one does not come to sell large livestock. Others say that the prohibition was added to prevent bestiality. However, this is a kind of custom that was not generally adopted, and one is not obligated to conform to it, even in a city where everyone else does so.
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, in some places, people had the custom to light a candle in a house on Yom Kippur's night, and in some - not to light it. However, both were intended for the good: those who lighted did so to prevent cohabitation on Yom Kippur since, in general, it is prohibited with the light of a candle. Those who did not light did so to not see the beauty of the spouse and not be aroused by it.<br />
