The first one was brought in the morning, the other one - in the afternoon. Other offerings had to be brought between the morning and the afternoon permanent (<i>tamid</i>) sacrifices.<p></p><p>This rule is based on the play of words. All other offerings should be brought on it, that is, on the first permanent&nbsp;offering. Other offerings were often peace offerings, "shlamim". The word for peace (shalom) also has the connotation of completeness, "shalem." Thus, one should complete all other offerings after the first but before the second <i>tamid</i>.</p><p>Passover offering was the only exception to this rule: it had to be brought after the afternoon <i>tamid</i>. Since the Passover offering required time and had to be ready for the Seder, the <i>tamid</i> was brought an hour earlier. If the Passover sacrifice day fell out of Friday, they needed all the time they could get - for slaughtering the sacrifice and roasting - which could not be done on Shabbat. Therefore, on such an occasion, they brought the second tamid soon after midday, and then they would follow with the Passover.</p><p>Art: Still Life with a Cut of Meat by Jean Baptiste Sim√©on Chardin</p>
