If the sacrifice owner was knowledgeable in slaughter laws, he could do it himself, but the remaining three steps had to be done by a kohen priest.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For each step, one needed to have the proper intention. If he is bringing a Passover offering, he should have in mind that he is slaughtering the animal as a Passover offering, receiving the blood for a Passover offering, and so on. If he says, "This is a Passover offering, a peace offering," the offering becomes invalid, and its service should be discontinued. This means that to have the Seder tonight, he will need to bring another animal sacrifice.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, one can disqualify an offering with a wrong statement. Some say that even a wrong thought can ruin an offering. As a practical matter, the kohanim priests were instructed to be silent and have in mind that they are bringing the sacrifice for the right purposes without specifying what it was.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Art:&nbsp;Agnus Dei, by Francisco de Zurbar√°n</div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div></div>
