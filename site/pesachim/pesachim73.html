We had this rule <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/01/pesachim-61-who-comes-to-seder.html" target="_blank">earlier</a>. If he, moreover, does this on Shabbat, he is liable for a sin-offering. However, what did he do? There is a view that one who acts destructively on Shabbat does not violate Shabbat. Only constructive acts count. If so, why is he bringing a sin-offering?<div><br /></div><div>Rav Huna bar Chinana asked his son to ask Rav Zerika this question when he sees him. The answer was: here is what he accomplished, true, the sacrifice is invalid, but at least, if they mistakenly put its parts on the Altar,&nbsp; the parts can stay there.<br /><div><br /></div><div>The next question: if he slaughtered a sin-offering on Shabbat, outside the Temple, and as an idolatrous offering, he did many wrong things. But why is it counted in particular as a Shabbat violation? What positive effect did he accomplish? - At least, those who will be eating it are not eating a piece cut from a live animal - which is prohibited alike for Jews and non-Jews.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Shabbat by Mark Chagall</div>
