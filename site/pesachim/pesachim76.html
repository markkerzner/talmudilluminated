The instruction to bring it <b>in its appointed time</b> includes even the time when the community is impure. Since the whole purpose of bringing the offering is to eat it, the <b>appointed time</b> applies to eating as well.<div><br /></div><div>This is not always the case. There are five cases when the offering is brought but not eaten - when the community is impure. These other offerings may be flour or animal meat, and they would have to be burned.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives by&nbsp;Frederic Edwin Church</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
