"Enough" means the volume of an average olive. But what is considered "meat?" - Any part that will be tender enough to eat in a grown-up animal is considered "meat." But any part that will harden in a grown-up ox is not considered meat towards the olive volume.<p></p><p>We already mentioned that one is <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/02/pesachim-83.html">not supposed to break the bones</a> of a Passover sacrifice. One can even be punished for doing so (of course, the usual rules of giving him a warning not to do it, within a few seconds before the act, apply). However, one is not punished for another prohibited action - leaving the meat over till morning. Why not? Some say - because you cannot punish for not doing. Others - that anytime something is prohibited but a correction is suggested - here, by burning it, you can't punish for it.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Butcher's shop by&nbsp;Annibale Carracci</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
