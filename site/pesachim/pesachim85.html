If it is taken out, it becomes disqualified, cannot be eaten, and has to be burned.<p></p><p>What happens if a part of the sacrifice protrudes outside this boundary? His problem is that he cannot chop the protruding portion off because he <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/02/pesachim-83.html" target="_blank">cannot&nbsp;break the sacrifice bones</a>. Therefore, he cuts into the flesh until he reaches the bone, then peels the flesh away until he gets to the join, and now he can cut off the entire bone. He does not have to take such precautions for other sacrifices but just chops it with a cleaver.</p><p>What about the doors (which, in an ancient city, could have significant depth)? The doorway, which is also called "doorjamb," is considered as outside of Jerusalem. By contrast, the windows are considered inside. Why such a difference? They should all be considered as inside Jerusalem. However, when the city was originally consecrated, the gateways were not included on purpose. A&nbsp;<i>metzorah</i> (ritual leper) could take refuge there, in the summer - from the sun, and in the winter - from the rain.</p><p>Art:&nbsp; Blue Door by Andrew Wyeth</p><div><br /></div>
