So it was allowed to bring a sacrifice on their behalf.<p></p><p>Now, we will see cases where the people may become impure by nighttime. The priests will still slaughter the lamb for them anyway. But, since there was a chance of them becoming impure, they would need to be combined with others who were definitely pure - or else the meat might have no eaters at all.</p><p>For example, take the case of a rescue worker who is clearing a house's debris where someone may have been trapped. He may find and save a person or find a corpse, touch it, and become impure. Or it could be someone who was promised a release from prison - because the jailers may change their minds.</p><p>In the last case, Rabbi Yochanan commented that if it is a Jewish prison, he can rely on their promise because the Jewish courts have integrity: "<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et2103.htm" target="_blank">The remainder of Israel will not perform iniquity and will not speak lies</a>."</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Prisoner by Vladimir Makovsky</p>
