We also said that "too far" is the distance one can travel on foot on Passover's eve, starting out in the morning and arriving at the Temple in the afternoon.<div><br /></div><div>In practical terms, this is the distance <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Temple+Mount,+Jerusalem/Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut,+Israel/@31.8364518,35.0415955,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x150329c91f33ffdb:0x6d2bbd5ce62d60ab!2m2!1d35.2359927!2d31.7781161!1m5!1m1!1s0x1502cdc4ba7c9a35:0xaf5f6cbfe5133203!2m2!1d35.010397!2d31.890267!3e0" target="_blank">from Modiin to the Temple</a>. Then you draw a circle with the Temple Mount as a center and with this radius. In real life, one would have to consider different opinions of understanding this rule, not just measure.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Rabbi Eliezer disagrees: as long as one is outside the Temple Courtyard, that is already too far, and one is exempt from punishment for not bringing a Passover offering. Rabbi Yosi offers support for it: in the Torah scroll, there are dots above the word "distant." Such dots usually indicate a doubt. In this case, he is just somewhat distant from the Temple, that is, outside the Courtyard.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Couple on a Walk by Gustave Caillebotte</div><div><br /></div>
