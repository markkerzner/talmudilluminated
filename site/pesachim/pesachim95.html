It happens a month after the Passover, and its laws are somewhat relaxed. <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/07/pesachim-22-not-eating-and-not-using.html" target="_blank">On the first Passover, he cannot eat chametz, cannot own it, and cannot benefit from it</a>. On the second one, one can happily own both chametz and matzah at the same time.<p></p><p>There is also a difference in prayer: the first Passover celebrates the miracle, and one recites the Hallel as giving thanks. But on the second one, it is a chance to make it up, not a celebration of what happened earlier. Surely, they say the Hallel while bringing the sacrifice on both occasions.</p><p>The <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/02/pesachim-75.html" target="_blank">cooking instructions</a> on the second Passover are the same: the meat is roasted and is eaten with matzah and better herbs. Here too, the sacrifice is brought even on Shabbat.</p><p>Art: The Basket of Bread by Salvador Dali</p><div><br /></div>
