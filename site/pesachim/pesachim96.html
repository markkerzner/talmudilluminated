How was it different from the Seder that occurred every subsequent year?<p></p><p>First, one had to designate the sheep to be eaten at the Seder early, <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1820" target="_blank">three days in advance</a>. There was a special procedure of <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1830" target="_blank">sprinkling its blood</a> on the lintel and the two doorposts using a hyssop bundle. In Egypt, this was to distinguish between the Jewish homes and the Egyptian homes, which would not apply to subsequent years.</p><p>The first Seder was conducted <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1828" target="_blank">in haste, dressed and ready to go</a>. Anybody who has been at the Seder nowadays knows that "whoever prolongs it is praiseworthy."</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Sheep and chickens in a barn&nbsp; Eugene Verboeckhoven</p>
