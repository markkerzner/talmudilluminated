What is the purpose of this rule? He cannot eat anything anyway! If it is chametz that he wants to eat, it is already prohibited in the second half-day before Passover. And if it is matzah, then it is already prohibited because one should not eat matzah the day before Seder - to welcome its taste at the Seder. Guess? The answer is that one should not eat egg matzah (called rich matzah) or too many vegetables.&nbsp;<p></p><p>Even the poorest among the Jews should eat while reclining, imitating rich and free people. Some say that he should recline during the first two wine cups while discussing being a slave, and some - that he should recline during the last two wine cups while discussing becoming free. To fulfill both views, he reclines for all four cups.</p><p>All should have four cups of wine. Even the poorest person supplied with the communal charity has to be provided with four cups of wine.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Wine Taster by Philippe Mercier</p>
