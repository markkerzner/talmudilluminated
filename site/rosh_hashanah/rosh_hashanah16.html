On Passover, the world is judged for grain. On Shavuot, it is judged regarding the fruit of the tree. On Rosh Hashanah, all who come into this world pass before Him, following the phrase "<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2633.htm" target="_blank">He that fashions their hearts, understands their deeds</a>." The reason for knowing the times of judgment is to pray with particular intensity and purpose.<p></p><p>However, there are other opinions: man is judged every day, man is judged every hour, and so on. Many questions come up regarding free will, the efficacy of prayer for the sick if their fate was already decided, and so on.</p><p>There are some rules that Rabbi Yitzhak related. A person is judged according to his situation at the moment and not his future deeds. Source? Ishmael was saved in the desert <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=21#P531" target="_blank">because of his current plight</a>, regardless of his future evil deeds.</p><p>Further, when one calls for judgement for his fellow, he attracts undue attention to his own sins. Sources: Sarah said, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=16#P387" target="_blank">Let God judge between&nbsp;me and you</a>." Next, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=23#P574" target="_blank">And Abraham came to eulogize Sarah and weep for her</a>."</p><p>Art: The Dismissal of Hagar by Govert Flinck&nbsp;</p>
