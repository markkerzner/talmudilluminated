A man is considered a relative of his wife, and a relative cannot testify. Even though he testifies about one act, we believe him regarding the adulterer but not regarding his wife. This principle is called "we split the testimony".<br />

Cases of lashes are decided by three judges: "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-1.htm">And they (the judges) shall judge them</a>..." gives two judges as the minimal number of "they." Since a court with an even number of judges is not acceptable, one more judge is added. Rabbi Ishmael requires twenty-three judges, based on the use of the same word "evildoer" in "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">evildoer liable to lashes</a>..." and in "...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/35-31.htm">who is an evildoer to die</a>."<br />
