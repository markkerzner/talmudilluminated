Additionally, the sheep and goats may be too young by Passover, or the doves may be too tender.<br />
<br />The extra month of the leap year is always inserted before the month of Passover; thus, it becomes the Second month of Adar, when Purim is celebrated.<br />
<br />
However, a leap year is never proclaimed before Rosh HaShanah, for if it were, people might forget about it by the time the Second Adar comes six months later. Then, they might mistakenly celebrate Passover on the Second Adar and consequently transgress the prohibition of eating leavened bread during actual Passover.<br />
