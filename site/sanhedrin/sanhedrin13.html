This is called Semichah, and three Sages are required for that. <br />
<br />
Semichah can also mean Rabbinical ordination in an unbroken chain since Moses. Once the Romans enacted that anyone who confers ordination is killed, anyone who accepts ordination is killed, and the nearest town is destroyed. Yehudah ben Bava placed himself between two mountains and ordained five Sages there. When the enemies discovered them, he told his students, "My sons, run! I will be like a rock that cannot be turned." The soldiers drove three hundred spears through him and made him like a sieve. Three Sages are required for ordination, but Yehudah ben Bava alone is mentioned because of his importance.<br />
