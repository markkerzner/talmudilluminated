If one wants to redeem it for money and its value is unknown, three people must estimate it. Three merchant appraisers are required for this and can even be partners.<br />
<br />
Items consecrated to the Temple need three appraisers to be redeemed; consecrated lands need nine appraisers and a Kohen.<br />
<br />
All cases of capital crimes require the Small Sanhedrin of twenty-three judges. If an animal is involved, like in the cases of sodomy, or when an animal kills a human, the animal is judged by the court of twenty-three, similar to human cases.<br />
