If one wants to redeem it for money, and if its value is not known, three people are required to estimate it. Three merchant appraisers are required for this, and they can even be partners.<br />
<br />
Items consecrated to the Temple need three appraisers to be redeemed, and consecrated lands need nine appraisers and a Kohen.<br />
<br />
All cases of capital crimes require the Small Sanhedrin of twenty three judges. If an animal is involved, like in the cases of sodomy, or when an animal kills a human, the animal is judged by the court of twenty-three, similar to human cases.<br />
