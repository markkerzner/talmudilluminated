Add to this charity collectors, a doctor, a butcher, and a teacher of children.<br />

The High Priest may judge and be judged. But that is obvious!? You might think that if the High Priest kills inadvertently, he does not go into exile since accidental killers return from their exile upon the death of the High Priest, and he himself cannot thus benefit. Therefore, the rule says that he is judged nevertheless.<br />
