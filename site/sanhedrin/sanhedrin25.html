Rabbi Yehudah says, "When are the dice-players ineligible to adjudicate or testify? When they have no trade but this, but if they also have another trade, they are eligible."<br />
<br />
Those who put personal gain above the law are suspected of accepting bribes, but what is the problem with gamblers? Rabbi Yehudah supposes that if all he does is gamble, he is not knowledgeable in the law or the ways of commerce. Therefore, if he has another trade, he is eligible. The first Sage considers gambling a form of theft: his customers don't really expect to lose, so when the gambler collects his wins, he is a robber.<br />
