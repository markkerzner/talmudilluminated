However, because of the concern that a solitary judge might be chosen from commoners who are not knowledgeable in monetary law, the Sages decreed that three judges are necessary even in loan cases. <br />
<br />
But could three judges not be all commoners, not knowledgeable in monetary law? - No, at least one of them will have picked some knowledge. If so, they should not be liable for errors, like professional judges? If they were exempt, there would be even more ignorant corner dwellers.<br />
<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">In the verse "...<a href="#" target="_blank">the master of the house shall approach a judge</a>..." the word "judge: is mentioned three times, so three judges are needed.</span>&nbsp;However, Rebbi says that five judges are required to start, so that at least three reach the same conclusion.<br />
