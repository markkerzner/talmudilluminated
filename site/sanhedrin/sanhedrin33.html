This is true whether the verdict declared the defendant liable or not liable. However, in capital cases, a verdict handed down in favor of the accused may not be reversed. <br />
<br />
What kind of error in judgment is reversible? A clear mistake in any Mishnah or a mistake in any ruling in the Talmud is considered a mistake on the part of the judge, and his ruling based on this can be reversed. What kind of error is not reversible? A matter disagreed upon in the Mishnah, then still disagreed in the Talmud, and currently having a clear consensus of the majority of the judges. If our judge ruled against this consensus, his ruling stands and is not reversible, even though it is considered a "mistake in the weighing of opinions."<br />
