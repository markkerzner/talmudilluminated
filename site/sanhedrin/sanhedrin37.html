Perhaps you do not realize we will eventually examine you with inquiries and questions. Know that capital cases are not like monetary cases: in monetary cases, a person may pay back the money he unjustly caused someone to lose and receive atonement, but in capital cases, the blood of the accused and the blood of his descendants are the witness' responsibility until eternity."<br />
<br />Therefore, the first man was created alone.&nbsp;Also, everyone should say, "For my sake, the world was created," - and he should be careful not to bring about his downfall by committing a transgression. Now, perhaps you will say, "What need have we for all this trouble?" - <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">If you were a witness and saw the event, you must testify</a>.&nbsp;  And perhaps you will say, "What need have we to incur responsibility for this man's blood?" - be secure, for "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/11-10.htm">when the wicked perish, there is joy</a>."<br />
