Said Rabbi Yochanan, "That is only concerning a pagan heretic, but as for a Jewish heretic, do not debate him, for he will become even more heretical."<br />
<br />
Continued Rabbi Yochanan, "Wherever the heretics have used a verse in Scripture as support for their arguments, the rebuttal can be found in a nearby verse." For example, it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-26.htm">Let us (plural) make man in our (plural) image</a>..." But the next verse says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-27.htm">God created man in His image</a>." Then why is the plural form used at all? To show that The Holy One, Blessed is He, never does anything unless He first consults with the Heavenly Court.<br />
