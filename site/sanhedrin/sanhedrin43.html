Should we compare it to the law of bulls brought for communal error, about which it is also stated "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-21.htm">outside the camp</a>," and there it means outside the farthest of the three camps, or to forbidden sacrifice "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-3.htm">outside the camp</a>," where "outside" means only outside one camp, the Temple proper?<br />
<br />
There are four points of commonality between execution and the law of bulls: removal, outside the camp, preparation (both prepare for something), and atonement (both atone). There are also four points of commonality with the forbidden sacrifices: they apply to a person, a sinner, a life being taken, and sacrificial disqualification does not apply.<br />
<br />
However, we should rather compare those laws that prepare for something, thus execution is compared to the law of bulls, and the place of execution is removed three camps from the courthouse.<br />
