In descending order of severity, these are stoning, burning, beheading, and strangulation. <br />
<br />
What difference does the severity of the execution make? In a situation where one has committed several capital offenses, each of which renders him liable to a different type of execution - since one cannot be executed more than once - he receives the more severe execution for which he is liable. Rabbi Shimon lists them in a different order: burning, stoning, strangulation, and beheading.<br />
