For the violation of three transgressions, a Noahide may be executed: for sexual transgressions, murder, and "blessing" the Divine Name. Some add idolatry to this list, and some say that for violation of any of the seven Noahide laws, a Noahite is executed.<br />
<br />A Noahite is executed by one judge based on the testimony of one witness, even though he violated the prohibition without having received prior warning. A man who judges or testifies can even be a relative of the accused.<br />
