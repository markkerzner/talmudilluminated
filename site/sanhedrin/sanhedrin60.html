One is also liable if he accepts the idol upon himself as a deity or says to it, "You are my god."<br />
<br />
However, if one embraces, kisses, sweeps, sprinkles water, washes, anoints, clothes, or shoes  an idol, he merely transgresses a negative commandment. If one vows in the name of an idol or swears in its name, one transgresses a negative commandment. Defecating to Baal Pe'or and throwing a stone at Markulis (Mercury) is a standard service for these idols.<br />
