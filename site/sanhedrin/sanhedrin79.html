If one intended to kill an idolater but killed a Jew instead, he cannot be executed by a Jewish court. While it is certainly forbidden to kill any human being, this matter is outside of the jurisdiction of Sanhedrin. If one intended to kill a premature, nonviable baby but killed a viable one instead, he is not liable to execution because the warning given to him would have been uncertain.<br />
<br />
If he intended to strike an adult with a blow not sufficient to kill an adult, but it landed on a child instead, and it was sufficient to kill a child, and the child died, he is not liable because he did not intend to commit murder, and any warning would be uncertain.<br />
