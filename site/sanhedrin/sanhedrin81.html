<br />One who has been flogged twice by the court - the court places him in a cell, and there they feed him barely until his stomach bursts. How could that be? Here, we are dealing with one who repeated the same transgression twice, provided that this transgression carries the penalty of excision from Heaven. Since he demonstrated that he wanted to die, the court just sped up his death. However, if he transgressed multiple prohibitions, but each of them only once, he just tastes various prohibitions.<br />
<br />One who killed another but not in the presence of witnesses - that is, they gave him a warning, but he just nodded his head instead of a verbal reply or a similar technical disqualification - the court places him in a cell and feeds him scant bread and water until he dies.<br />
<br />
Complete cell procedure: They put him in a cell the size of his body, then fed him scant amounts until his stomach shrinks, then fed him abundant barley until his stomach bursts.<br />
