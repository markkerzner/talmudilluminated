<br />
Said Rabbi Elazar, "If a person has understanding, it is as if the Temple were built in his days, for <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/2-3.htm">understanding is mentioned between the two names of God</a>, and <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/15-17.htm">so is the Temple</a>."<br />
<br /><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Regarding the&nbsp;<a href="" target="_blank">dead whom prophet Ezekiel resurrected</a>, there are many opinions: they stood on their feet, uttered a song, then died; it is a parable; they went to Israel, married wives, and fathered sons and daughters, and Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira was one of their descendants.</span><br />
<br />
Regarding who they were, there are many opinions: that they were from the tribe of Ephraim, who left Egypt too early and were killed; they were people who denied the Resurrection of the Dead; these were people who covered the entire Temple with pictures of various idols.<br />
