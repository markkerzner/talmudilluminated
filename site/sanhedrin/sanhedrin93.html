Six miracles occurred for them. The furnace rose to ground level, the walls were breached, and the foundation caved in so everyone could see them unscathed inside the fire. The golden image on top of it was overturned on its face; the elite Nebuchadnezzar guards were burned by the furnace's fire, and Ezekiel resurrected the dead in the plain of Dura.<br />
<br />
When they emerged from the fiery furnace unscathed, all the nations of the world came and struck the enemies of Israel (a euphemism for the Jews themselves) on the faces, saying to them, "You have such a powerful God, and yet you submit to Nebuchadnezzar's threat and bow to the idol?!" Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah immediately declared, "<a href="http://bible.cc/daniel/9-7.htm">Yours, O Lord, is the righteousness, and ours is the shamefacedness as of this day</a>."<br />
