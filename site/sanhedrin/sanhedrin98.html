<br />
In the generation of the Messiah, there will be denunciation among the Torah scholars.<br />
<br />
The Messiah will come to the generation that is completely virtuous or completely sinful. If a person is somewhat virtuous, he is unlikely to repent, because he focuses on his good attributes.  On the other hand, one who completely lacks virtue has no grounds for self-deception and thus is open to the realization that he must repent and merit God's redemption.<br />
<br />
The coming of the Messiah will be preceded by multiple troubles and tribulations. Ulla said, "May he come, but may I not see him," but Rav Yosef said, "May he come, and may I merit to sit in the shadow of his donkey's dung!"<br />
