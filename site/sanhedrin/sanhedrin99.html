<br />
The books of Prophets contain many descriptions of life's utopian, idyllic state. All these refer only to the Messianic Era, but the reward of the World to Come is beyond human comprehension, and "<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/64-4.htm">No eye except Yours, O God, has seen that which He will do for one who awaits Him</a>" - this is the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan. However, Shmuel says there will be no difference between this world and the Messianic Era, except that the Jews will be completely free from foreign dominion.<br />
<br />
What is the reward for constant Torah study? "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/16-26.htm">If a person toils in the study of Torah, the Torah will toil for him after death</a>" - asking God to keep giving him knowledge. <br />
<br />
Every <a href="http://bible.cc/job/5-7.htm">man is created for toil</a>, and it is <a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/16-26.htm">not physical labor but verbal toil</a>, specifically the study of Torah, because "<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/1-8.htm">This Book of the Torah is not to leave your mouth</a>." Therefore, happy is one who merits to toil in Torah.<br />
