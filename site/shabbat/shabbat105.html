For example, in the First Commandment, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=20#P2054">I am God your Lord</a>" the word "I" has a somewhat unusual long form, "Anochi". This stands for "Ana nafshi ketivat yahavit" and means "I Myself wrote and gave the Torah."
<br />
<br />
If one tears his clothing in anger or for a dead, he is acting destructively, and for destructive acts one is not liable for Shabbat violation. But if he destroys in order to repair, then he is indeed liable. What is the minimal measure of destruction in this case? - The same as would be for repair.
<br />
<br />
However, we learned in another place that one is liable for tearing on Shabbat!? - This is talking about his own dead, for whom he is obligated to rend his clothes. This is also true if a Sage dies, for them everybody is obligated to mourn.
<br />
<br />
Rav Avin said that if he tears to cool his anger, then he has achieved a constructive purpose and should be liable for it on Shabbat. But is such behavior even allowed? One should never get angry, and freely venting one's anger is tantamount to subjugating oneself to its power, where one's soul burns out!? - True! What Rav Avin meant is that one only pretends to be angry, to show his displeasure with specific people.
