Circumcision involves making a wound, which is prohibited on Shabbat, so it is done only for a definite male, and in this case it will happen a day later.

However, Rabbi Yehudah finds an indication in the Torah that androgyne is a special case and must be circumcised on Shabbat, if it is his&nbsp;eighth&nbsp;day. What is his source? The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=17#P408">Circumcise <b>all</b> your males</a>," and this extra word "all" includes the androgyne.
