It does not have complete utility though, since rich people don't have any use for such small clothing. Nevertheless, the Torah gives it the status of a garment, and it is subject to the spiritual disease of tzaraat (white spots looking like leprosy), which indicates to the owner that he has some defects: &nbsp;stinginess, bad talk, etc.. How do we know that this indeed is the minimal size?
<br />
<br />
Since the Torah did not just say "garment" but "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=13#P3097">and the garment</a>", we see that even a piece of three by three finger-breadths is included. But maybe the Torah meant a larger piece of clothing, three by three hand-breadths, which has some use for everybody, rich and poor? - No, that the Torah did not have to include, because it already included the warp and the woof, in that they can become impure: if such small unfinished piece is susceptible to impurity, then how much more so a finished piece of three by three hand-breadths! 
<br />
<br />
But perhaps Torah wanted to include garments made of other materials, and not only the wool and linen which it mentioned explicitly? - No, by repeating the word "garment" in "garment of wool or garment of linen," the Torah showed that only these materials are considered significant for the laws of tzaraat purity.
