<h1>Shabbat 71 - Drag-along atonement</h1>

If one forgot that it was Shabbat, and reaped in the amount of a dried fig (sufficient for Shabbat violation) and then ground it, then, as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/12/shabbat-68-major-rule-about-shabbat.html">we learned earlier</a>, he brings one sacrifice for both, since the root cause was his one error regarding Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
However, if he then remembered that it was Shabbat, but this time forgot that reaping and grinding were prohibited, he would be liable to two sacrifices, one for each error. Finally, if he becomes aware of his first mistake, then his initial reaping connects to the second one, his initial grinding connects to the second one, and the end result is that he brings only one sacrifice for all, and it drags along the atonement for his other acts. The other way around is not completely true: if he finds out about his later reaping, it connects to the previous one, but his later grinding does not connect to the first one, and he needs a separate sacrifice for that. We don't use the principle of drag-along twice - this is the opinion of Rava.
<br />
<br />
However, Abaye says that we do use the drag-along twice, and only one sacrifice is brought in either case.
<br />
<br />
In another place, we find that Rava does not subscribe to drag-along!? - After he heard the idea from Abaye, he started using it. But then let him agree to Abaye completely! - No, he applied only a part of Abaye's principle, but not all of it.
