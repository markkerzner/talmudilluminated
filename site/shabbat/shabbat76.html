What is considered a significant amount for which one would have to bring a sacrifice if he carries it by mistake? Here is a general rule: if it is something that people normally store, and its quantity is significant enough for people to care about it and store it, carrying this amount is considered a bona fide violation of Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
It also depends on the intended use. For example, if one carries processed straw, then the significant amount is a cow's mouthful. If it is stalks of straw, it should measure lamb's mouthful, and if it is grass, fit for young goats or sheep, the amount is their mouthful.
<br />
<br />
Leaves of garlic and of onion are fit for human consumption, so the amount for which one is liable on Shabbat becomes a standard measure of minimal amount of food, that is, a dried fig. If these leaves dry out, then again they are not fit for humans and revert to animal food, so the significant amount is the mouthful of a young sheep or goat.
