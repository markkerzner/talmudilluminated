We also detailed the amount of food one must carry to incur liability, depending on the type of food.<p></p><p>Now, if he first stores food in a designated place, then his action shows that this stored amount is significant in his eyes. Then, he is liable for even a smaller amount of food if he carries it. Let's see the details.</p><p>If one stores a minute amount of seed for planting, or as a sample to show to prospective customers, or to use as medicine - and then he carries it to the street on Shabbat, he is liable. All other people, however, are only liable for <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/shabbat/shabbat90.html" target="_blank">standard amounts</a>.</p><p>If he (the one who stored the grain) decides against planting, the seed loses the importance he attached to it. If he carries it back, he is only liable for the standard amounts.</p><p>A dissenting opinion: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says that once the first person stores the food intending it for planting, anyone else becomes liable if he carries this amount. Thus, the thought of the first one made the second one liable.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Sower With Setting Sun - Vincent van Gogh</p><p><br /></p>
