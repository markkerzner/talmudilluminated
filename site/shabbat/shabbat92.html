However, he is only liable for regular way of carrying.<p></p><p>For example, whether he carries objects in his right hand or in his left, in his bosom, or on his shoulders, he is liable because this was the normal way the priests carried objects in the Tabernacle. In general, the laws of Shabbat are determined by how things were done in the Tabernacle. Since building the Tabernacle was a model of construction for the whole world, "labor" is determined through that. On the other hand, if he carries it with his foot or in his mouth, in his armpit or in his ear, he is not liable for that.</p><p>In addition, if one carries an item above 10 handbreadths from the ground, he is also liable. But that is not a normal way of carrying?! - For the Levites, it is! We learn it from the Altar, which was 10 handbreadths high and which the Levites carried on their shoulders, leaving 10 handbreadths to the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>But learn it from Moses, who was 10 cubits (3 meters) high? And all other Levites must have been the same height? - Not necessarily. Perhaps Moses was much taller than the other Levites. After all, we have a rule that Divine presence rests only upon someone who is wise, strong, wealthy, and tall.</p><p>Art: Bedouin Women Carrying Water Jars by John Singer Sargent</p>
