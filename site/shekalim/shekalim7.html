Similarly, surplus money intended to redeem one captive should be given to that captive since he already acquired it through the hands of collectors acting as his appointed agents.
<br />
<br />A surplus of money collected for the poor should be given to other poor people, but a surplus of money collected for one person should be given to him. A surplus of money collected to bury the dead should be used for other burials. Still, if it was collected for a specific dead, then there are three opinions: give it to his heirs, make a monument for him, or keep it intact until Elijah the prophet comes and decides.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, only common people need monuments, but the righteous's teachings serve as their memorials and outlive the stone. Nevertheless, today is customary to build monuments for the righteous, not for their benefit, but for the living who will be reminded of them.

In the final analysis, &nbsp;charity and just deeds are better than the sacrifices and the money (shekalim) used for the sacrifices. People used to taunt King David, going next to his windows and asking, "When will the Temple be built?" - because it was known that it can be built only after King David's death. However, David would say, "Even though they want to anger me, I am happy with their words. I, too, would give up my life to build the Temple." And nevertheless, God would say, "I will make your life complete, because one day of your life, David, with your charity and just deeds, are more precious to Me than the future sacrifices."
