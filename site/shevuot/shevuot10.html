<br />
Rabbi Shimon disagrees about the goats of the New Moon and says that they atone specifically for cases when one, while being pure, inadvertently eats impure sacrifices.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir says that the atonement of all he-goats is the same: they atone for inadvertent purity violations of the Temple and its offerings.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon Ben Yehuda has a different version of what Rabbi Shimon said: that the goats atone for a progressively wider range of infringements, from New Moon to Festivals to Yom Kippur. Said the Sages to him, "If they are so similar, can a goat designated for the New Moon be brought on Yom Kippur ?" He said, "Yes. Even though they are not the same, they have that in common: they deal with the purity of the Temple and its offerings."<br />
