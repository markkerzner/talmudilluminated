<br />
With the consent of the king, a prophet, Urim VeTumim, and the Sanhedrin of seventy one, they would prepare a Thanksgiving offering and a song. The High Court marches around the perimeter of the area being added, and the two loaves of the Thanksgiving offering in front of them – carried by the kohanim – and all Israel behind them. The Thanksgiving  loaves were used because they can only be eaten inside of Jerusalem, and they were very large, made with a few hundred cups of flour. They sang “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a0.htm">The Song of Thanksgiving, call out to God everyone on earth.</a>”, accompanied by harps, lyres, and cymbals.<br />
