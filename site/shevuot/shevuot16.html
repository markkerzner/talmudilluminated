<br />
Those who say that a few attributes are sufficient say so because in their view the initial holiness of Jerusalem lapsed with the Babylonian exile. Since Ezra did not have all the attributes, but was still able to sanctify Jerusalem and the Temple, we see that not all attributes are needed.<br />
<br />
Those who say that all are required say so because in their view the initial holiness of Jerusalem continued through the Babylonian exile. If so, then why did Ezra need any sanctification at all? - Just for remembrance of the ritual.<br />
<br />
If one became impure while in the Temple and forgot about it, he is obligated to bring a "variable" offering. This is not mentioned directly in the Torah. However, since there are two separate prohibitions to enter the Tabernacle and the Temple while being impure, and the words Tabernacle and Temple are used interchangeably, the extra prohibition is applied to one who becomes impure while in the Courtyard.<br />
