Abaye say, "Yes," but Rava say, "No."<br />
<br />
They challenged both based on the following ruling. If one says, "It is hereby incumbent on me that I not eat meat nor drink wine, as on the day on which my father died (source for fasting on a yahrtzeit), or as on the day when Gedaliyah ben Achikam was killed (fast of the 3rd of Tishrei), or as on the day on which I viewed Jerusalem in its destruct "on" - he is indeed prohibited. Shmuel commented, "This is only true if he already vowed from that day on."<br />
<br />
This seems perfect according to Abaye: one attaches a vow to a vow, and in the same way an oath to an oath. However, it does not agree with Rava, who said that one cannot attach one oath to another oath! Rava will tell you that this ruling discusses a vow attached to a prohibited object (meat and wine), not an attachment to a vow, which, although mentioned, would be ineffective.<br />
