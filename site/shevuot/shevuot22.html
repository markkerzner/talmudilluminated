Is it like all eating, a volume of an olive, or, since the earth is inedible, he means even a minute amount? - Remains unresolved.<br />
<br />
If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate and drank, he is liable for only one offering. But if one swore, "An oath that I will not eat and that I will not drink," and then he ate and drank, he is liable to two offerings.<br />
<br />
If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate prohibited foods, such as animals or foul that were not slaughtered correctly, unkosher fish, seals, frogs, flies, bees, mosquitoes - he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him because he swore to do something he is already obligated to do, and his new oath did not take effect.<br />
