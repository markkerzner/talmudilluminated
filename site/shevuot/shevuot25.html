<br />
For example, if one swears "I will give something to so-and-so" or "I will not give it to him," or "I swear that I gave it to him" or "I swear that I did not give it to him," - this is an oath about others.<br />
<br />
If he said, "I swear that I will sleep" or "that I will not sleep," "I slept" or "I did not sleep" - these are oaths concerning intangible matters.<br />
<br />
If one said, "I swear that I will throw a pebble into the sea" or "I will not throw the pebble," "I threw the pebble" or "I did not throw" - these are oaths concerning non-beneficial acts.<br />
