<br />
Rabbi Akiva said to him, "If so, if you want to interpret the verse literally, then you only have oaths dealing with good and bad. What about neutral oaths, such as to throw a rock into the sea?" Rabbi Ishmael answered, "I get it from the extra inclusion of 'for anything that a person utters in an oath'". Said Rabbi Akiva, "This inclusion also includes oaths concerning the past!"<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva answered well! What does Rabbi Ishmael have to say? The teacher of Rabbi Ishmael was Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakaneh, the time's chief kabbalist, and Rabbi Akiva's teacher was Nachum Ish Gamzu, known for saying, "This also is for the good." They differed on which of the 13 rules of Torah interpretation is prevalent - the generalization/specification or the amplification/limitation.<br />
