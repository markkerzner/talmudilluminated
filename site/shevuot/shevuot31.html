* He should not have an ignorant student assist him in judgment;<br />
* He should not join another judge whom he knows to be a thief; <br />

* A student assisting a judge who sees an argument in favor of a poor man should not be silent about it; <br />
* If a student sees his teacher making a mistake, he should not wait till the teacher concludes the judgment, for the student to demolish it and get honor; <br />
* If a teacher tells his student "You know me, I won't lie. Someone owes me a maneh ($5,000), but I have only one witness - please be the second one" - the student should not be a witness;<br />
