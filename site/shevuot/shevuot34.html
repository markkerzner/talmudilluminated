<h1>Shevuot 34 - Why Can Oath of Testimony Be Only About Money?</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TFUHxnMoy8I/AAAAAAAAD_U/LdTrBGlHD2A/s1600/Thomas+Hickey+-+John+Mowbray+with+his+money+agent.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TFUHxnMoy8I/AAAAAAAAD_U/LdTrBGlHD2A/s320/Thomas+Hickey+-+John+Mowbray+with+his+money+agent.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Here are three (of five) explanations why this is so.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer:<br />
<br />
In <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">the verse about the oath of testimony</a>, the word "or" is stated two times, and in <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-2.htm">the verse about the oath of deposit</a> the word "or" is also stated two times. This establishes the connection between the two, and just as oath of deposits speaks only of a monetary claims, so too the oath of testimony speaks only of a monetary claim.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva:<br />
<br />
In the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-5.htm">When one shall become guilty in regard to one of these matters</a>," the word "of" is a limitation, meaning that there are cases when one is liable and cases when one is not, and when is he liable? - in money matters!<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yose HaGlili:<br />
<br />
"...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">and he is a witness who either saw or knew</a>." Which testimony can be established by either seeing or knowing alone? - in money matters!<br />
