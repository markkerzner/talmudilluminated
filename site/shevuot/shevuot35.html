<br />
If one said, "I adjure you," "I command you," I bind you" (to testify) - the witnesses are liable.<br />
<br />
If they swore by heaven and earth, then they are not liable. However, if they swore by "Lord," by the Tetragrammaton, by the "Lord of Hosts," "Compassionate," "Merciful," "Slow to Anger," "Abundantly Kind," or by any of the subordinate Names of God, they are liable.<br />
