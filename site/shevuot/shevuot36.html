If he swore falsely and subsequently confesses his sin, he must repay the principal plus an additional fifth and bring a "guilt offering" sacrifice in the Temple.<br />
<br />Although this oath applies to all types of debts, not just deposits, it is nevertheless called the "oath of the deposit" because a deposit is the first example mentioned in the Torah.<br />
<br />
The oath of deposit applies to both men and women, to non-relatives and relatives, to those who are qualified to serve as witnesses, and to those who are disqualified, in court and out of court.<br />
<br />
In truth, there is no reason to think these rules would not apply, but they are only stated to contrast with the oath of witnesses discussed previously.<br />
