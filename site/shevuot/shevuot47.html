If, however, the plaintiff is also not trustworthy, then the rule is that "the oath returns to its place."<br />
<br />
What does "the oath returns to its place" mean? The Teachers in Babylon, that is, Rav and Shmuel, say it means that the oath returns to Sinai, where it was stated, "do not steal." The courts do not get involved,  and the one who is dishonest must fear Divine retribution.<br />
<br />
The teachers in Israel, that is, Rabbi Abba, says that the oath returns to the one who was initially obligated to take it, in order to free himself from liability. And, since he cannot swear, he remains liable and has to pay.<br />
