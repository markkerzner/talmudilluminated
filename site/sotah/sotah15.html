Usual flour offerings use wheat, but this one is made of barley. Regular offerings have oil and frankincense added, but this one is brought without. Why is it he, and not the wife, that brings it? - Because one should not be his or her own accuser. But why does the husband deserve this inferior sacrifice? - The wife is  unfaithful when the husband is unfaithful or gives another reason.

Proceeding, the Kohen brings an earthenware cup and pours in water from the purifying water of the priests. This large vessel stands in the Temple courtyard for the Kohanim to pour water on their hands and feet before they start their service. It is made of copper mirrors used by Jewish women in Egypt to look beloved to their husbands. 
<br />
<br />
How much water does the Kohen put in? Half a log, or about 5 ounces. Rabbi Yehudah says he takes only a quarter of a log or about 2.5 ounces. Parenthetically, Rabbi Yehudah will also require a shorter text to be erased into this water later in the preparation. The Kohen enters the Temple building, turns to the right, and finds a particular stone with a ring. He lifts up the stone, gets the dust from under it, and makes it float on the water.
