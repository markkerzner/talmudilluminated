Why is all that? Because such people appear knowledgeable, but in reality, their opinions are not based on accurate knowledge.

Also despised are those who pretend to be modest and turn their eyes away from women, and as a result, they may bump into a wall or hit their foot against a stone, but it is all just a pretense. Evil is those who say, "Tell me how I can improve, and I will do it," which implies that they have already perfected themselves in their estimation.

King Yannai (who killed all members of the Sanhedrin) bequeathed this to his wife: not to be afraid of the Sages' vengeance because they are righteous and will not do wrong, and neither be afraid of the followers of King's Yannai sect, because they esteem her. She should only be scared of false people who pretend to be righteous like Pinchas, but their deeds are licentious as those of Zimri.
