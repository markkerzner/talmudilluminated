By contrast, the blessings and the curses that the Jews pronounced before entering Israel, on the mounts Eival and Grizim, had to be said in Hebrew because these it is described as "And they will answer and say" - and the same words ("answer and say") are used when doing <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/10/yevamot-2-sister-in-law.html">chalitzah</a>, which has to be done exactly as written, in Hebrew.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then describes how the blessing and curses were pronounced, what else happened on the day when the Jews crossed the Jordan River and entered the Land of Israel, and about the Torah, which had to be written on stones in seventy languages, in precise translations, for everyone to know.
<br />
<br />
It then turns to Joseph, who knew seventy languages, as mentioned in the story of his appointment to be viceroy. He was given a test by Pharaoh, and he replied in every language that Pharaoh spoke. But how did he learn all of them? - Angel Gabriel visited him the night before and taught them. Joseph would go up one step on the way to Pharaoh's throne with each language. In the last step, he spoke in Hebrew, and Pharaoh could not answer. Pharaoh made Joseph give an oath not to reveal this.<br />
