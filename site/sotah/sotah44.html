Some people are soft-hearted, and they may lead the army to lose its morale, contributing to defeat. This is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yosi HaGlili says he is "afraid and fainthearted" because of his transgressions. For example, he may have spoken between putting on the head and arm tefillin. Or he spoke between the second part of morning prayer (Yishtabach) and the third one - the blessing of Shema. This category is then placed at the end so the transgressors won't be embarrassed, and people may think they claim other exemptions. 
<br />
<br />
After that, the army should be steadfast. Strong soldiers are put in front so that if any of their brothers fall, they help him stand up. Strong soldiers are also placed in the back: if anyone wants to run away, they have authority and axes to stop him - because running away is the beginning of defeat, just as it happened when the Israelites first ran away from Plishtim and <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a04.htm">then were defeated</a>. 
<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, in times of national danger, the exemptions do not apply, but everyone goes to war, even a groom from his room and the bride from her chuppah.
