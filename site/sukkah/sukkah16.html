Even though these boards are not utensils and therefore do not accept impurity and should be valid yet, since they originate from a utensil (bed), the Sages decreed not to use them.
<br />
<br />
If one hollows up a cavity under a haystack to use it as a sukkah, it is not valid because this hay was already there before, and he did make it for the sukkah. However, if initially, someone left even a small opening under the hay, then he can dig some more and live there: the initial opening qualified as a sukkah - if it was constructed for shade - and he just completed the necessary height.
<br />
<br />
If one left his wall hanging and not reaching the ground, this is OK, provided that they are within the three handbreadths from the ground and small goats cannot enter his sukkah. In fact, if his sukkah is only 10 handbreadths high, he can use such a hanging wall that is only slightly more than four handbreadths, right in mid-air. If it is closer than three handbreadths to both the floor and the ceiling, we apply the principle of "connect" ("lavud") and consider the missing three handbreadths both above and below as if they were present.
