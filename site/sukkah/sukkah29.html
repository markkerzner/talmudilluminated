However, its residents must behave as if it were their permanent home for the seven days of the festival. How do they show it? If he has nice vessels, he should bring them to the sukkah. Nice clothing? - Bring them to the sukkah. In general, he should eat, drink, and relax in the sukkah.<div><br /></div><div>One cannot deny, however, that sukkah is not conducive to deep concentration. Where should he study, inside or outside? For things that are easy or already understood - he can review them in the sukkah. For hard things, he can go learn them at home.</div><div><br /></div><div>If it begins to rain, he should persist. However, once there is enough rain to cause discomfort, he can leave. What is called discomfort? When his porridge is ruined because of the rain.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>When we are all ready for the sukkah and it rains - what can this be compared to? To a slave who came to pour wine for his master (and wine was usually diluted with water,) but the master took this water and poured it in his face.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;The drunk violinist by Gerrit van Honthorst</div>
