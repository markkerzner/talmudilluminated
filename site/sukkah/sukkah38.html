However, the Sages added the requirement to also wave the bunch in all the directions of the world and up and down. This is to show that one is doing it for the sake of the One to whom all directions of the world and heavens and earth belong. Another explanation: to protect from harmful winds on all sides, which shows that even the non-essential parts of a mitzvah (such as waving, which is not obligatory) have the power to stop bad things from happening.
<br />
<br />
If one was traveling on the road and did not have the lulav, he can wave it when he comes home, at the table - since he can take the lulav all day. The waving of the lulav is done while reciting the praises of God and gratitude, called Hallel. One should preferably say the Hallel himself, but if he does not know, then others, even if they are not obligated, can recite it for him, and he will answer "Amen!" He deserves a curse, though, for he should have learned it himself.
