There are many reasons why the eighth day continues the first seven. There are also many reasons why it doesn't.<p></p><p>The conclusion, however, is that the eighth day is an independent Holiday, for six reasons, abbreviated as "Pezer Keshev."</p><p>P (payis) - lottery. During the previous seven days, the priests had a rotation system to allow every priest to bring a bull sacrifice - because the sacrifices were numerous. On day number eight, they would return to drawing lots for the right to perform the sacrifice.</p><p>Z (zman) - time. A new time blessing, "Thank you for allowing us to live to this time," was said.</p><p>R (regel) - festival. It is a different festival when one does not dwell in a sukkah.</p><p>K (korban) - sacrifice. The sacrifices for this day were different from Sukkot and fewer in number.</p><p>Sh (shirah) - song. The Levites sang a different song.</p><p>V (brachah) - blessing. The Holiday is mentioned by a different name in the prayers. Some say this refers to a special blessing for the king that the people said to commemorate King Solomon, whom the people blessed on the eighth day of the First Temple.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;The Queen of Sheba Meeting with Solomon by&nbsp;Piero della Francesca</p><p><br /></p>
