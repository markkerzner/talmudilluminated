For example, rejoicing goes on for eight days, and it is expressed with thanksgiving prayers (Hallel), eating (ideally, sacrifices), and drinking. The source for this is the phrase, "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=16#P5352" target="_blank">And you will be only happy.</a>" There is a rule that the word "only" comes to emphasize something at the expense of the other. What is it? - The eighth night of the festival is included in the joy of the previous seven days.<p></p><p>A certain heretic whose name was Sasson (rejoicing) said to Rabbi Abahu, "In the future, the Jewish nation will be drawing water for me." He quoted the phrase from Isaiah, "<a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15943/jewish/Chapter-12.htm" target="_blank">You will draw water with rejoicing (Sasson)</a>."</p><p>Rabbi Abahu answers, "If it said, for Sasson, you may be right. But since it says with Sasson, the skin of that person (you) will be made into a flask and be used for water drawing."</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Still Life with Four Stone Bottles, Flask and White Cup by Van Gogh</p>
