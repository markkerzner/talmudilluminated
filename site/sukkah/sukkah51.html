Whoever did not see it never saw rejoicing in his life.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Down from the Temple Courtyard, separated from it by fifteen steps, was the Women's Courtyard. The women sat and watched from the second tier while the priests and the Levites prepared the illumination. They had a large golden candelabra with four golden bowls on each branch. The total amount of oil used amounted to 120 <i>log</i> measures or about 15 gallons. The wicks were made from the worn-out belts of the priestly garments. There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated from this light.</div><div><br /></div><div>The righteous men would dance, with the torches in their hands, and sing songs and praises. The Levites came with their harps, lyres, cymbal, trumpets, and countless other instruments. There was a song for each step going down.</div><div><br /></div><div>When they finally reached the gate, they would turn their faces towards the Temple Courtyards. Then they said, "Our forefathers turned their backs toward the Sanctuary and worshipped the sun, but as for us - our eyes are toward God (Yah)."</div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;David Playing the Harp by Jan de Bray</div>
