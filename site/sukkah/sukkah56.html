After a week of staying on the table, it was divided between the priests serving in the Temple - between the two groups serving that week, incoming and outgoing. 
<br />
<br />
However, on the three holidays: Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot, all priests were permitted to serve in the Temple, not just the two groups, and then the bread of vision was divided equally. Even when a Holiday does not actually occur on Shabbat but is adjacent to it, the bread was still divided equally - since all the priests who came for the holidays were still there on Shabbat.
<br />
<br />
The northern part of the Temple courtyard was more special since many services were performed there. The incoming priests were dividing and eating the Bread of Vision there to symbolize that they were dedicating themselves to the services for the coming week; those outgoing ate the bread in the south, where no services were usually performed. However, the family of Bilga always divided their bread in the south. Why?
<br />
<br />
One of the daughters in this family married a Greek general, and when the Greeks entered the Temple, she was beating the Altar with her shoe, saying, "Wolf! Wolf! You are consuming Jewish money, yet you don't protect them in hard times." The Sages punished her family. But why the whole family? - She must have heard it from the family. 
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, there is a rule: woe to the bad person and woe to his neighbor. On the bright side, there is also a rule: "Blessing to a good man, and blessing to his neighbor." The Talmud finds a phrase in Isaiah to support this.
