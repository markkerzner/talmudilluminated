The rationale is that this is a gradual worsening of the situation, which can be fixed. However, for serious calamities they fast and cry out right away. What is considered a serious calamity? If the crops grew abnormally and may be totally ruined, if the rains fell irregularly (too strong or too weak), or any other natural or economic condition which may result in a dangerous food shortage.

Once all Israel collected in Jerusalem for a Festival, but, due to a drought, there was not enough water for them to drink. Then Nakdimon ben Gurion, a very wealthy Jew, went to a Roman patrician to borrow twelve wells of water. He promised to return the water by way of rains, and if not - to pay twelve talents of silver (equal to about seven million dollars). The promised day has come, but there was no rain. Thrice did the patrician send for his money, but Nakdimon argued that he still had until the end of the day. Then the patrician went to the baths, preparing to celebrate, while Nakdimon went to the Temple to pray. He said, "You know, God, that I did not do it for my own - or my family's - glory," and the rains poured. And yet, the patrician claimed that the rain came after the sun was down. So Nakdimon went back to the Temple to pray, and the sun has shown through the clouds.

In general, the sun stood still for three people: Moses, Joshua, and Nakdimon.
