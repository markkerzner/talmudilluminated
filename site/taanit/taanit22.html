Rabbi Beroka once asked Elijah the Prophet, "Who in this marketplace deserves to be in the World to Come right now?" Elijah pointed out a Jewish man who was wearing non-Jewish clothes. Rabbi Beroka asked him what he did, and the man told him to come tomorrow. On the next day, the man said that he was a prison guard and kept particular watch over Jewish female prisoners so that they would not be violated. He would also inform the Sages of any evil designs he heard about, and the Sages prayed and annulled them. The previous day, he was rushing on just such a mission.

Then Elijah pointed out another two people. They were jesters, and when they saw anybody looking depressed, they would not let him go until he laughed and felt better. They would similarly make peace in cases of feuds.

Courts would proclaim a fast when a military force passed through even without the intent of making war on Israel -&nbsp; because of a high potential of confrontation.  Here is a related story. Pharaoh Necho passed through Israel, and king Yoshiyahu decided to confront him. His logic was based on this phrase in the Torah, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=26#P3528">A sword will not pass through your land</a>," and besides, Necho was trusting in his idol. Nevertheless, Yoshiyahu died in battle.  Why was the righteous Yoshuyahu punished? - Because he did not consult Jeremiah, and thus did not know that his generation was not worthy of Divine protection and that the phrase did not apply.
