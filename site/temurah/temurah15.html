However, this never happens with communal offerings.
<br />
<br />
What are these personal sin-offerings? There are five types: offspring of a sin-offering, exchange of another sin-offering, a sin-offering whose owners died and are thus no longer in need of atonement, one whose owners used another sin-offering for their atonement (which can happen when the first offering is temporarily lost), and one that became older than a year. This law is known as one that, instead of logic, is based on a teaching passed from Moses through successive generations. However, Rabbi Yehudah argues and says that he possesses a more authentic version of the rule, according to which even communal offering in the same situation also has to die.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon is known to give  reasons for the rules of the Torah. He says that communal offerings need not die, and it can be proven by logic: for example, the sin-offering whose owners died, is not needed and therefore cannot be used. However, this is not applicable to the Community of Israel, which does not die.
