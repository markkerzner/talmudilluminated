<br />
<br />
On the other hand, although it is completely impossible to consecrate a blemished animal, one can exchange a blemished animal for a sacrifice, and this exchange will work. In that way, one can create a blemished sacrifice, and in this exchanges are more stringent than regular sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
And in this sacrifices and exchanges are the same: the offspring of a peace offering and its exchange&nbsp;are peace offerings; so are&nbsp;their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, until the end of time, with all the accompanying details. That is because peace offerings can be females, unlike, for example,&nbsp;burned&nbsp;offerings. Why did "end of time" have to be mentioned? - To disprove Rabbi Eliezer, who says on the next page that an offspring of a peace offering cannot be brought on the Altar.<br />
