Some animals are forbidden  to be offered on the Altar, and if they are mixed up with permitted animals, they forbid the whole herd, even hundreds and thousands, for the Altar.  These include one that sodomized a person or one that was sodomized, one that was designated for idolatrous purposes or actually worshipped, one given to a prostitute as a payment, one exchanged for a dog, a hybrid, a sick animal (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>), and one born of Caesarean section.
<br />
<br />
An animal designated for idolatry is prohibited, but what's on it may be used, however, an animal that was actually worshipped makes all of its garments and ornaments prohibited as well. Both are permitted to be eaten.
<br />
<br />
That is the rule, but we already learned a very similar rule a while back, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-71-animal-mix-up.html">in Zevachim</a>! There, if any of the five types of sin offerings that are not needed mixed with other animals, this makes the whole herd prohibited. Why is it repeated? Because in Zevachim all the mixed-in sacrifices were forbidden for benefit, so you might have thought that the ones above, who are permitted to regular use, don't prohibit the herd - the teacher had to tell us that they do.
