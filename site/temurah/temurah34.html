<h1>Temurah 34 - What Is Buried, And What Is Burned</h1>

<br />
<br />
And the following are burned: chametz on Passover - since Rabbi Yehudah says that it is the proper way to destroy it; Kohen's portion of grain that became ritually impure - because it would be too easy to make a mistake and use it; and fruit of a tree for the first three years (orlah), as well as grain that grew in a vineyard - for the same reason of preventing a mistake.
<br />
<br />
All things that must be buried may not be burned, and vice versa. Why is that? Because in the case of things that must be buried, their ash is also forbidden for benefit, but for things that must be burned - their ash is permitted.
