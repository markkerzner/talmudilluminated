As a result, many family laws do not apply. For example, the child is not included in the inheritance rules. If that child is a daughter, then the man's son can marry her after she converts. The Sages later forbade this marriage to avoid confusion.
<br />
<br />
How do we know this rule? - The Torah said,"  "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=7#P5110">Do not intermarry with them... for he will turn your children away from Me, and they will serve other gods</a>" Why did the Torah say "he" and not "she" or"  "they?" Because the relationship is not equal. He (the non-Jewish husband of your Jewish daughter) will lead your Jewish children astray. Hence, this is still your child. But she (the non-Jewish wife of your Jewish son) will not lead your Jewish children astray - because they are not considered Jewish, they are not "your" children for the Jewish law.
<br />
<br />
Can we deduce that in the opposite case, when a non-Jew marries a Jewish woman, the child is entirely kosher? - Not quite. He is not an illegitimate child; he is not a mamzer, but he is blemished: if the child is a daughter, she cannot marry a Kohen.
