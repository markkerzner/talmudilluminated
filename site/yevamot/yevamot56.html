The same applies to being liable for cohabitation with any woman who is prohibited to him. But what is considered the beginning of cohabitation?
<br />
<br />
Shmuel says this is the contact (literally, "kiss") of the genitals. He brings an analogy: imagine a man who places his finger on his mouth; it is impossible not to push the flesh of his lips. In other words, Shmuel agrees that a minimal degree of penetration is required, but he argues that it is inevitably achieved by contact. 
<br />
<br />
However, in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, they brought another opinion: insertion of the corona constitutes the beginning of cohabitation, with all the legal consequences. What is then considered the completion of the act? - Insertion of the part of the member beyond the corona. What about the emission of seed? - Many say that it is legally not required. What about the "emission of seed" mentioned by the Torah? - they say that the situation should be fit to emit it, but not really do it.
<br />
<br />
And for what things does he acquire his yevama? - If he is a Kohen, she can already eat Kohen's portion (terumah), which is ordinarily permitted only to Kohen's family. He inherits his brother. He can annul her vows and bury her - which is ordinarily prohibited to a Kohen for anybody but his close relatives.
