What is his logic? - The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4281">Speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take … tithe.</a>'"<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that the tithe goes to the Kohanim. How could he exclude the Levites altogether? - He didn't; he meant "Also to the Kohanim." And what is his logic? - There are twenty-four places where the Kohanim are called Levites because they, in fact, come from the same family: Aaron, the progenitor of all the Kohanim, comes from the tribe of Levy.
<br />
<br />
If so, how can Rabbi Akiva argue that the tithe should not be given to the Kohanim? - He says that the tithe is unique because one can eat it "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4286,">anywhere</a>," whereas the Kohen cannot eat it in a cemetery - because he cannot go to the cemetery at all! What would Rabbi Elazar answer now? - He says this teaches a different law, namely, that the tithe can be eaten in any state, even being ritually impure.
<br />
<br />
Later, when the Second Temple was being built, the Sages penalized the Levites, took the tithe away from them, and gave it to the Kohanim - because the Levites did not come back to build the Temple; some say it was done for the benefit of poor Kohanim.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah had a garden from which he collected the tithe. Rabbi Akiva turned the garden's entrance into a cemetery so that Rabbi Elazar (who was a Kohen) would be prevented from taking the tithe. Rabbi Elazar said, "Akiva is with his shepherd's sack, but I will survive anyway." (He was very wealthy).
