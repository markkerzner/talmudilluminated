The prohibition of marrying the wife of one's father does not apply here. Rabbi Yehudah forbids the son to marry such a woman. The <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23" target="_blank">verse </a>talks only about a legal wife, but Rabbi Yehudah derives his additional prohibition from the context. Even the first teacher will agree that the Sages later prohibited such marriage.
<br />
<br />
Now a few riddles. Who can say about a man that he is "my paternal brother but not a maternal one, he is my mother's husband, and I am his wife's daughter?" This can happen legally following the first teacher, but not Rabbi Yehudah. A man (Jacob) violated a woman and had a daughter with her. Reuven (Jacob's son from another woman) married the woman whom his father violated. Reuven's daughter can say that Reuven, her paternal brother, married her mother.
<br />
<br />
Another one. A woman says: he is my brother, and he is my son. I am the sister of this child of mine whom I carry on my shoulders. Answer: a man had relations with his daughter and fathered a son with her. The child is at once her son and her paternal brother.
<br />
<br />
Yet another one: a woman says, "Peace to you, my son; I am your sister's daughter." Answer: one had relations with his daughter's daughter and fathered a son. She is at once the child's mother and its paternal sister's daughter. 
<br />
<br />
Why do we need such riddles? Some say - to sharpen the minds of the Torah scholars, while others - that Queen Sheba posed these riddles to King Solomon to test his wisdom.
