This could be due to a seminal emission on the night of Yom Kippur or to some other ritual impurity. In that case, the designated Kohen would become a High Priest and perform the service.
<br />
<br />
However, how is this possible? Normally, a Kohen becomes a High Priest by either being anointed with special oil or by donning the eight garments of the High Priest, with the appearance of gold, and additional items such as a breastplate and tzitz. The third way to be consecrated for High Priest's work would be to perform a service specific to him. In sum, he should do something special that only a High Priest can do.
<br />
<br />
In the Second Temple, there was no anointing oil. After the first morning sacrifice, the High Priest would take off his "golden" garments and dress in pure white linen and become indistinguishable from a regular Kohen in the Temple. Thus, if a disqualification were to occur now, there seems to be no way to consecrate the standby Kohen. Rav Adda said, "His belt is different, since it is of pure white linen, while that of a regular Kohen is of colored wool together with linen." This advice only works if the belt of a regular Kohen is indeed different, but there are varying opinions on that. Abaye suggested, "Let him dress up in golden garments and turn some parts of a burning sacrifice - which is also a special service!" Rav Pappa said, "Any service that he does makes him the High Priest because only a High Priest can perform service on that day." The last advice seemed like a loophole, but Rav Pappa found a precedent that served as proof.
