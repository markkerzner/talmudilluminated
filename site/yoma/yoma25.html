Why were lots used for that? - What kind of question is this, for we already said it was to avoid discord!? - Actually, the meaning of the question is why assemble four times when one lot for all services could be sufficient? - It is good to stir up the Courtyard, for the greater the number of people serving God - the better.<br />
<br />
Did they use their regular garments or holy garments for the lots? Some say that they used the regular garments because otherwise, the bullies among the priests could seize services by force had they already been attired. Others say that if they drew lots in regular garments, they might rush and do the services in them, which would be wrong.
<br />
<br />
What was awarded in the second drawing? - Slaughtering the daily offering, throwing its blood on the Altar, cleaning the Inner Altar, cleaning the Menorah, and bringing the limbs of the daily offering onto the ramp of the Altar. Then we have the argument about the order in which the limbs were carried.
