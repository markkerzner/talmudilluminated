But how was it possible? The light of the moon shows in a column, and the light of the sun is spread out!? - It was a cloudy day. This teaches us an additional lesson: the sun behind the clouds diffuses its heat. Why is that important? - for example, this may affect the leavening of matzah.
<br />
<br />
Rav Nachman continues with teachings about the sun. The sun bursting through the cloud feels stronger than in the open sky, just as the smell of vinegar in a jar, when released, feels stronger. The thoughts of wrongdoing are more harmful to a man than an actual act, just as the smell of roasting meat is more pleasing than the meat itself. Relearning something once learned but forgotten is harder than acquiring new knowledge, similar to making new cement from old cement. 
<br />
<br />
The rising of the sun spread behind the clouds is compared to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2622.htm">antlers of a morning hind</a>. On that subject, why was Ester compared to hind? - Just as a hind has a narrow womb and is desirable to her mate every time as the first one, so was Ester desirable to the king Ahasuerus. And so are the words of the Torah always beloved to those who learn them. And just as the antlers always grow, so too the prayers of the righteous become stronger as they persist in them. 
<br />
<br />
When did the incident of invalid early sacrifice occur? If on a weekday, why is it mentioned here talking about Yom Kippur. And if on Yom Kippur, the moon is yet small!? - Really, it occurred on a weekday, and this is a digression. Incidentally, bird offerings and flour offerings would also be invalid if offered before daybreak.
