For that, he needs simple white linen vestments. First, however, he needs to immerse himself in a mikveh. That will be his second immersion of the day.<p></p><p>They bring him into the chamber called "Parvah" (after a magician who once dug a tunnel there), and it was in the Temple Courtyard area and spread a linen garment between him and the people. He washes his hands and feet from the washbasin, undresses, and goes into the mikveh. Then he ascends and dries himself. They bring his white vestments. He puts them on, then washes his hands and feet from the washbasin again.</p><p>The garments are white and not golden to emphasize humility, but they are of the finest quality. The vestments used in the morning were of Egyptian linen worth 1,200 zuz, and in the afternoon -&nbsp; from Indian linen, worth 800 zuz. Some say they were even more expensive. This money came from the public treasury, but he could if he wanted to add his own funds.</p><div><span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Art: Linen Industry by&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #494848; font-family: Catamaran, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">William Hincks</span></div>
