When the Torah said, "With this Aaron entersâ€¦ with a bull," - did it mean to include (with the bull or even with its blood), or to exclude (with the bull but not with its blood)? Rav Ashi suggested the following answer: "Does Aaron really enter dragging the bull by the horns!? - Of course not! Rather, he brings in the blood. Thus, the substitute High Priest can also bring the blood." And Rav Ami, who disagreed, what is his logic? - He says, "With this Aaron is ready to come into the Holy of Holies" - that is, with the bull which he slaughters, not with its blood.

Does this bull represent communal offering or his private offering? If you accept that it is his private offering, then I have another question for you: can you exchange it for another (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-2-sacrifice-exchange.html">a prohibited act, but does the holiness transfer</a>?) We know that transfer (Temurah) only works for a personal offering, not for partners. Does the High Priest take all other Kohanim as partners in his offering (Temurah is invalid), or does he make his own atonement and achieve it as a side effect (Temurah is valid)? - No definite answer.<br />
