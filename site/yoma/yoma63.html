What if one instead took the two goats outside the Temple and slaughtered them there? Since these were bought with Temple funds, they became sanctified as a sacrifice at the point of sale. And since he is now slaughtering a sacrifice outside the Temple, he deserves the punishment of <a href="https://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/06/makkot-23-positive-value-of-lashes.html" target="_blank">karet (excision)</a>&nbsp;for each goat. However, if the High Priest drew the lots, and then he sacrificed the goats, he is liable for only one goat - the one designated for the Name, but not the one for Azazel.<p></p><p>Granted that the goats belong to the Temple, but what specific service are they fit for, so that bringing them as a sacrifice would qualify for the offense of "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=17" target="_blank">sacrifice brought outside</a>?" The answer is that there will be a goat offering in the "mussaf' - additional offerings later today; these two goats can potentially qualify as such offering.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Two Goat by Adrien Dauzats</p>
