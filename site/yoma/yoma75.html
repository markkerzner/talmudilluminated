Others - that since manna could take on any taste but always looked the same, they were never satisfied with it. Rav Yosef (who was blind) demonstrates that a blind person eats but is never fully satisfied.

<br />
More parallel disagreements: what does this phrase mean, "Worry in one's heart? - Quash it!" Some say that it sounds like "remove from your mind" - by studying the Torah. Others - to tell it to others. But how does this help? - Since others will suffer from hearing about your troubles, and they don't deserve it, God will remove it from you to spare them this unwarranted suffering.
<br />
<br />
More facts about manna are drawn from the words describing it. For example, it was "like bread, oil, and honey." How can it be? For young people, it felt like bread, for old - like oil, and for children - like honey, each according to the age preference.
