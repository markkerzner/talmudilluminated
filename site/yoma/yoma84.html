He went to a noblewoman who gave him the remedy on Thursday and on Friday. He asked about the Shabbat (when he was busy with the students and could not visit her), but she said he would not need it on Shabbat. He pressed her to tell him the medicine, and she said, "Swear that you will not reveal it." He said, "To the God of Israel, I will not reveal it." Then he went ahead and taught it publicly. How could he do it? - He meant, "To the God of Israel I will not reveal it, but to His people, I will." But she would still accuse him, and it would be bad publicity that a Rabbi did it!? - He told her immediately that his oath was not valid.<p></p><p>If a building collapsed on Shabbat and they don't know if somebody was trapped there, and furthermore if he was dead or alive - they violate Shabbat for any doubt about the life-threatening condition. If they find him alive, they keep clearing away the rubble even if it extends his life just a little, but if he is dead, they leave him there.</p><p>Art: The remedy by Benjamin West Clinedinst</p><div><br /></div>
