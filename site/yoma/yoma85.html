It is a means to achieve a clean slate. Other means for it are listed below.<p></p><p>If one does something listed as "Don't do it" in the Torah, and that is also qualified as "his soul will be cut off from the people" - then, if he did it inadvertently, he brings an offering in the Temple and is forgiven. When there is no Temple, his repentance is enough, and he is completely forgiven on Yom Kippur.</p><p>If it is a regular "Do it" or "Don't do it," and he violates it, then his repentance is effective right away, even before Yom Kippur.</p><p>If he tries to use this rule to his advantage and says, "I will do the wrong thing, but I will then repent," - a chance to repent may not happen.&nbsp;</p><p>The above is true only in regards to himself. However, if he wrongs his fellow man, Yom Kippur does not atone until he pacifies his fellow.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;After the Misdeed by Jean Beraud</p>
