For example, this is common when an observant Jew does something wrong. There are various means of atonement for it, such as Yom Kippur, suffering, death, or better, the study of the Torah and teaching it to others.<div><br /></div><div>It also depends on the person. For example, Rav, a prominent Torah scholar in Babilonia, said that <i>Hillul Hashem</i> occurs when a scholar like him does not pay the butcher's bill on time. The reason is, such behavior will lead the butcher to suspect stealing. Abbaye said, "This applies only in the city where the customers bring money to the butcher. But if the custom is for the butcher to go and collect money owed, this is not a problem."</div><div><br /></div><div>On the positive side, one should accumulate wisdom and deal with people pleasantly. What do the people then say? - Happy is the father who taught him Torah; happy is the teacher who taught him Torah. To him applies the phrase, "<a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1049.htm" target="_blank">You are my servant, Israel, through whom I am glorified</a>."</div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;A scholar in his Study by Thomas Wyck</div>
