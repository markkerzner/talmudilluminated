Now he had to face the challenges.<br />
<br />
In the previous argument with Aaron about eating the sin-offering, why didn't Moses eat it himself, for he, unlike them, was not precluded by mourning? Rav answered - he was busy talking to God from morning till evening.<br />
<br />
When Miriam contracted leprosy, it was not Moses, who was not a kohen, who pronounced her status, and not Aaron, who was a relative, but it was God himself, who also was a kohen, Who confined her and later released her. We see from this that Moses was not a kohen!  - No, maybe leprosy is specifically given to the sons of Aaron to decide.<br />
<br />
In truth this is an&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">argument found</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;between earlier authorities of the Mishna, for when God became angry with Moses for refusing to go Egypt, this, unlike all other angers, left no mark - so says Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha. However, Rabbi Shimon says that this anger too left a mark, and Aaron became a kohen instead of Moses, who thus remained a Levi.<br />
