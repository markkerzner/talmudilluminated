Or perhaps, since the limb belongs to the body, and the body is only half-out, then the limb is considered inside?" To this there was no answer.<br />
<br />
Some say that Rabbi Eliezer asked a different question: "If three of the five carriers have left the Courtyard, are the other two carriers&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">considered&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">already out and impure?" To this there was also no answer.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />
Rabbi Elazar asked another question, "Do the bulls that are burned&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">already</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;contaminate foods and liquids while they are still inside the Courtyard?" Since they will have a very strong impurity when they are out of the Courtyard,&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;it is enough to make food and liquids impure, since these are easily rendered impure. Afterwards he himself resolved it: prior to their exiting from the Courtyard they are not fully considered bulls that are burned, and thus they do not contaminate the food yet."<br />
