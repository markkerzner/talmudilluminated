Its ashes, mixed with spring water, are used to purify people from ritual contamination caused by a corpse. If one sacrifices this cow as an offering outside the Temple, he is not liable, because the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-4.htm">and to the entrance of the Tent of the Meeting he did not bring it</a>" does not apply to it. In the same way the scapegoat that is sent away on Yom Kippur does not entail liability if sacrificed outside.<br />
<br />
Other animals do not entail liability for sacrificing outside because they are cannot be brought "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-4.htm">as an offering before God</a>." This list includes an animal that has sodomized a person or was sodomized by a man, one designated as idolatrous sacrifice or one that was worshipped, one that was used as dog's exchange or a harlot's payment, torn by a wild beast, or born by Caesarean section.<br />
