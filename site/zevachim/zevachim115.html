One is also not liable for actions that are not the last step in the service, thus, for example, one is not liable for separating a handful from the flour-offering, but is liable for burning it. Likewise, one is not liable for receiving the blood, but is liable for throwing it on the altar.<br />
<br />
Initially sacrificial service was done by the firstborn, and everybody was allowed to build his private altar. This is mentioned in the Torah when it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/24-5.htm">And Moses sent the youths of the Children of Israel, and they brought up burnt offerings</a>." The firstborn lost this privilege after they worshipped the Golden Calf, and the kohanim, the sons of Aaron, began to serve in their stead.<br />
<br />
Once the Tabernacle was erected, private altars became forbidden. When the Jews came Israel, crossed the Jordan, and erected the Tabernacle at Gilgal, near Jericho, private altars again became permitted. F</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">inally, t</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">hey became completely prohibited after the building of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br />
