This was still permitted to non-Jews after the Temple was built and the Jews had to bring their sacrifices there.<br />
<br />
Could the sacrifices brought on private altar be eaten as peace-offerings, or did they have to be burned, as burnt-offerings? Those who say that they could be eaten point out that "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/4-4.htm">Abel brought from the firstlings of his flock and from their fats</a>..." - that is, he brought the fats but ate the rest. And those who say that Abel brought only burnt-offerings explain that he brought the fattest of the lambs and burned them completely.<br />
<br />
But didn't <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-12.htm">Jethro bring peace-offerings</a>? - Jethro came after the giving of the Torah, when eating sacrifices became allowed.<br />
<br />
What did Jethro <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-1.htm">hear that he came</a>? He heard about the splitting of the Red Sea. But why did Rahav say about it "<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/2-11.htm">No spirit remained <i>erect</i> in any man</a>" (hint)? - She knew, because there was no leader or ruler who did not come to her. She started at 10, was a prostitute for 40 years, and converted at 50.<br />
