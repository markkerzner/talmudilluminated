Bringing it as any other sacrifice makes it completely invalid.<br />
<br />
What happens if one changed two of these conditions: he brought it early, in the morning of the fourteenth, and for the sake of a different sacrifice (one can imagine that he rushed early in the morning, but then realized that it was too early and decided to bring it as a peace-offering).<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua considers this as if he brought it on the thirteenth, and as any Passover sacrifice brought outside its time as a different one, it is valid. Ben Beteira says that morning is like afternoon, and the sacrifice is invalid.<br />
<br />
Ben Azzai goes back to the </span><span style="font-size: medium;"> very first ruling of this Tractate and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> disagrees with it, saying, based on a tradition from the seventy-two members of the Sanhedrin,  that sacrifices that are eaten, if brought for a different type, are valid. This rule adds only the burnt offering to the invalid ones, but the Sages did not agree with him.<br />
