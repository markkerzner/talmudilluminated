However, there are three aspect in which they are the same. <br />
<br />
One is liable for the following on a private altar: if he eats the sacrifice beyond the allowed time; if one had a wrong intent to eat the sacrifice beyond allowed time, the sacrifice becomes invalid and one is liable for eating it; one is liable for eating it while being ritually impure.<br />
<br />
How do we know that? In fact, we might even think the opposite. The Torah stated <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-17.htm">that a sacrifice kept overnight is burned and one that goes out of the Temple is also burned</a>. &nbsp;Therefore I might think that since the sacrifice on the private altar already exited the Temple and was not burned, so too one that was left overnight is not burned! - Bird sacrifices disprove this, since they are less strict than the animal sacrifices, and they do become invalid with time. - Birds are no proof, because they require a kohen. To dispel all these arguments, the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-11.htm">This is the law of the peace offerings</a>" - to be applied both inside and outside the Temple.<br />
