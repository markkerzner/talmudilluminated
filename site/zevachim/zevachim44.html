However, how do we know that? The Torah only hints at this law, and even that only in the context of peace-offering. <br />
<br />
Here is the relevant passage, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-18.htm">If some of the meat-offering of his peace-offering will be consumed at all on the third day...it shall be rejected</a>" and the person who eats it will be cut off from the people.<br />
<br />
We have <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/12/zevachim-29-rava-masterfully-explains.html">already learned that this verse is talking about the intention to eat on the third day, not the real eating on the third day</a> - since the meat becomes rejected right away, which can only happen as a result of his intention.<br />
<br />
However, how do we know that this law equally applies to other sacrifices, and not only to those that are similar to peace-offering, which would include just first-born and tithe? - From the extra word "of the meat" we learn that it applies to all sacrifices that are eaten. What about sacrifices that are not eaten, like the burnt-offering? - This is learned from the extra "offering" in the word combination "meat-offering."<br />
