More specifically, they can consecrate voluntary offerings or offerings in fulfillment of a personal vow, and bring them to the Temple for sacrifice. This is the derived from the verse "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/22-18.htm">Any man (even an idolater) who will bring his offering for any of their vows, or their  voluntary offerings to God for a burn offering</a>..." It is a matter of dispute (which will be discussed 148 days from now)  whether they can consecrate only a burnt offering are any voluntary offering, such as peace- or thanksgiving-offering.<br />
<br />
However, because most of the offerings laws of sacrifices include the term "sons of Israel", the non-Jewish are excluded from some stringencies. Thus, if a Kohen, while slaughtering the sacrifice, intends that its meat will be eaten beyond the allotted time, then, even though the sacrifice becomes invalid, eating its meat does not carry the usual penalty of being cut off from the people. The same applies to the leftover meat which was left beyond its time, and to eating it in the state of ritual impurity. These are the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yose, however, holds a person liable to the usually penalty for all these actions.<br />
