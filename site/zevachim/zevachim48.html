<br />
The Torah mentioned the north requirement in connection with the burnt offering. Why did the teacher not list this first? Because this requirement for the sin-offering was derived using the rules of Torah exposition, and as such, it was more beloved to him. The teacher used it to sharpen the minds of his students.<br />
<br />
What is this derivation? "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-25.htm">In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin-offering be slaughtered</a>." <br />
