One testified about the size of the Altar, another - about the position of the Altar, and the third one testified that they may offer sacrifices on the Altar, even though the Temple was not built yet.”<br />
<br />
Therefore some say that <a href="http://rabbikaganoff.com/archives/1536">sacrifices can be brought even nowadays</a>. The opponents say that we would be missing not only the Temple, but also many other details for which we need a prophet.<br />
<br />
The Altar had a ramp leading to it; the ramp was in the south, while the Altar was in the north. Why? Compare this to a person lying face down, whose thigh (Altar) is in the north, and his head (the ramp) will have to be in the south, following the verse “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/1-11.htm">He shall slaughter it at the side (literally, thigh) of the Altar, in the north</a>.”<br />
<br />
Alternatively,  the ramp is in the south so that the first turn the Kohen takes is to the right, and all turns a person takes should be to the right.<br />
